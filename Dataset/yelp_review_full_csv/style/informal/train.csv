1,"Disappointing cakes.  The \""buttercreams\"" are made with shortening, and no butter at all.  Anyone who has tasted real buttercream knows that it is not as shelf stable or white as shortening frosting and tastes like real butter.  The chocolate cake has some kind of flavoring in it.  Fake rum, maybe?  I really think people buy these cakes because they don't know any better.  Perhaps the term \""buttercream\"" is used loosely outside of Europe, but true buttercream is not a concoction of Sweetex (sweetened shortening, commercial grade) and some other fake ingredients.  Carl also is very stuck in his ways when it comes to design.  He's not on the cutting edge, he will only do certain designs that he's been doing since the 80s.  There will be no rolled fondont ribbons or pulled sugar flowers or bright colors.  If you want a simple cake, and don't mind that it is frosted with fake buttercream because that's what is more shelf stable and easy to work with, then go to Carl's.\n\nI see that since I posted my review Deb R. from Carl's Cakes commented.  Thanks for your comment and those pictures.  I can definitely tell which ones Carl decorated as opposed to other cake decorators working there.  The cakes with a very simple piping design and love birds have Carl written all over them.  The cakes that are more creative and interesting are done by other people.  Oh, and you guys must go through a TON of shortening for all that \""buttercream\""!"
1,"Such a bad experience it's almost comical.$70 per person dinner & soda isn't included ($2 a pop and had to pay for refills).   Bathrooms broke and had to switch boats(no compensation for the inconvenience).  Spent 2hrs sitting at port for the buffet which consisted of red potatoes, pork, soggy salad, & sub par prime rib. We waited 30 min for a server that didn't know he had our table, once he found out he didn't exactly provide stellar service, actually he didn't provide service at all because we never saw him again. Definitely an experience to remember, unfortunately not the most pleasant."
1,"Went solo for seafood night. There has been a change over time at the M and Studio B. Less tables, tables sit dirty for Long periods of time. You stand in line worse than any Disney line. Only 3 items seem to be added for seafood night. Oysters, crab legs and not King crab and shrimp. Everything else is their regular buffet. So for these items you pay a great deal more. My family refuses to stand in line which is a long time. Last night there were only 14 couples ahead of me. It took over an hour before I got a table. Do not think I will be back until something improves."
1,"We have been getting our lunch 3 days a week from the Vons deli for about 7 months now. There is one employee there that is ALWAYS in a bad mood and rude and I called and spoke with the assistant manager which changed nothing. Yesterday my assicoiate went and picked up our lunch and the manager happened to be in the deli, so he told her about our experience and was given one excuse after another about her poor customer serivce and attitude. Ok here comes the best part......Today when he went in he was told that you have to pay for the bacon now! Really for the last 7 months we have not been charged for bacon by ANYONE who makes our sandwich and now that we complained we are being punished for saying something! As a manager myself in a customer service industry, this is a complete disgrace and joke."
1,"This is based on the Buffet alone\n\nDon't let the extravagance and massive size of Caesar's Palace\ndistract you from how freaking horrible their buffet was.\nI'm not sure if this rule works but when you go to a buffet for dinner in\nLas Vegas and no one is in line for it, I'm thinking it is a first warning.\n\nThe eating area looks nice enough, but when you see the spread\nit is just awful, at no point should you pay $25+ for a buffet\nand you're able to be at one end of the buffet and you can see the other\nend of it, the buffet was THAT short. It was just unimpressive.\nI don't know about you, but when I go to a buffet, i like SELECTION.\nThank goodness they had snow crab legs because if they hadn't\ni would've FLIPPED, so of course i tried to get my meal's worth.\n\nThe food in general was just unappetizing for my eyes and my stomach.\nAvoid the buffet at all costs."
1,"This place sucks.  period.  The food is low-end, soggy, overpriced crap.  The service is a joke - you should not come here if you have plans within even 2 hours of entering this place because you will probably still be waiting for your check.  Oh yeah and the best part?!  They dont \""do\"" change.  SO basically if you dare to pay for your meal with cash - don't expect any of the change they owe you from YOUR money.  Probably to save for their pathetic servers because I doubt they actually get tipped anything.  This is quintessential Charlotte BS built for use by the culture-less yuppie zombies that are slowly taking over this city.....beware."
1,"I think the ownership has changed.  The people who are running this place now are poor at providing customer service.  What a shame.  I have tried to eat lunch at this place three times over the last month (since the ownership changed) and each time they demanded cash only since \""the credit card machine is broken\"".  WTF?? For a whole month?  If you stopped taking credit cards just say so.  Today when I went to check again, they again said the credit card machine is still broken.  So I declined to eat there and then the manager said \""don't you even have seven dollars for lunch?\""  WTF.....what business is it of theirs how I manage my finances.  I use my credit card for almost everything other than when I am just buying a drink at the Seven-Eleven.  That is how I maximize my bonus points and kick-backs and that is how I track all my expenditures too.  So if you want to be treated like an idiot go there to eat.  If not, don't go because you will certainly be disappointed.  I wonder how long before this place will go under too?"
1,Bought a personal pan pizza at aprox 2 pm. Wife got a taco. I am now throwing up pizza now since 7 pm. Food poisoning. Stay away
1,"This club should be renamed DXS... because the only thing it has an excess of is douchey-ness.\n\nA totally un-original club, where the only highlight was the pool no one was allowed to swim in. The music was okay. The line to get in was ridiculously long (waited over an hour). The hotel/ club staff were incredibly rude. The cover was overpriced, the drinks were overpriced, and the club was wayyyy overcrowded."
1,"So far not impressed with this place. I've spoke to at least 4 people today and most of them with borderline rude, and none of them were able to help me with my inquiry about becoming a new patient. I guess they don't need my business! I find it very frustrating that I called several tmes and none of them were able to answer any of my questions."
1,Birthday signup we got the $30 gift card and went over mid week.  Another one of my favorite places.  The service was terrible.  The guy was new and he was trying but we sat down and it took 2 and half hours.  I don't think it's supposed to take that long.  I even saw the manager on my trip to the bathroom and told him that the server needed help.  Nothing changed.  I don't think the manager cared because I didn't see him helping.  \nBut the biggest issue besides being there for 150 minutes was that the fried rice problems.  The cook who I think was also new.  And it could have been the server. But he didn't make enough.  And he accidentally gave the bowl to the wrong person.  Then he realized and took it back and gave it to the poor girl next too us who was also having a birthday.  And I think the first person took a taste of it.  Then my girlfriend gets her rice and because there wasn't enough left he put in a bunch of burned rice that was sitting on the edge of the table trying helplessly to give her a full bowl.  Pretty sad I had to pay a few dollars for that upgrade.
1,"I was craving meat jun, drove to the outdated address that was listed. The person who answered wasn't sympathetic at all. Paid $14 for 1 thin slice kalbi- almost see through, 1 piece BBQ chicken and 1 slice meat jun. I coulda got cheaper in Hawaii. I specifically asked for Koch-jun sauce which they did not give me in my to go plate, and no chopsticks- really??!?!? If I could I would give this a negative 1 star for the entire experience. So shame an waste my time, gas, and money!"
1,"So unorganized, several expired products and not at all fresh vegetables sums up this shop.  Go to Rajbhog even if it takes that extra 2 miles"
1,"One star is extremely generous. The blonde manager is incredibly rude. Who i actually belive is the head manager which is embarrassing.  I will never, ever return to this particular ULTA. She was very unhelpful and witnessed her ream a worker in front of customers. So UNPROFFESIONAL. I was appalled by her attitude and behavior. One thing nice I can say is Nadia the clinique rep was amazing."
1,"I've been going here for two years, but only started seeing them more than once a year to start allergy shots this past April. The actual doctors are good, not great but good enough for me not to search elsewhere. The staff however is abysmal. They regularly cancel appointments or allergy injection hours without notice, lose paperwork and in one case demanded payment and attempted to deny treatment for billing they never actually sent me. \n\nA great example, I decided to start allergy shots in April. They were supposed to start the proces immediately, but only started the process when I follow-up with them in May wondering why I hadn't been charged for it yet. Once they ordered my serum for my allergy shots in May I was told to wait a month. In late June, 6 weeks later, I called and they said they weren't sure, they had no record of my serum yet. Then they confirmed and made my appointment to start. Which they lost when I went in. In the less then 3 months I've been getting shots the \""open hours\"" for shots have been altered without notice 3 times.\n\nOnce I finish my allergy shots I'm leaving and never looking back."
1,"Gluten-free sure, but unfortunately lacking in healthy choices. \nWent for breakfast. Smoothie was the most horrible one I have ever had in my life. Full of vanilla and stevia (and low-quality powdered protein).\nNot real eggs- rubbery and cold, junk food disguised as healthy food.\nThe bread was yukky- rice with tapioca starch.\nIf you want gluten-free processed junk food, go for it."
1,"I'm sad to have to give this review. I've tried to eat here a half dozen times over the past several months, and succeeded only once. While the food was ok, the service leaves much to be desired.  The biggest complaint? That they don't seem to understand why they have hours of operation on their web profiles, and posted in their window.  As a busy full time worker and student, sometimes I can't make it to a restaurant until after 9. So if you post that your hours are until 10 pm, and the sign in the door says the same thing, and if come in at 9:15, when there are still customers eating, why the hell would you tell me your closed? The sad part is that this isn't a one time occurrence. It has happened repeatedly over the last several months.  You'd spend your money more wisely at New Seoul. My experience over the years is that Korean restaurants either look nice and have poorer quality food and service, or they look like a hole in the wall, but have better food and service.  Sol's on the Square is the former, while New Seoul is the latter, and they actually are open durring their posted hours of operation."
1,"Let me start off by saying that I haven't ate at Coco's in probably 10 years, used to go with my grandparents when I was young. My girlfriend ate here with a co-worker a couple weeks ago and said she wanted to go back and get some Pie. I figured why not I really couldn't remember the quality of the food so I decided we'd give it a go.\n\nWe decided to go on her lunch hour and it took the hostess/waitress a good 5 minutes to seat us even though they were not busy at all. This wasn't that big a of a deal since I'm always willing to wait for a good meal. Too bad it never came! We decided to split a sandwich but after 35mintues of waiting I paid for the drinks and had to walk out. The waitress gave us the run around and kept making excuses about why the food was so slow. I will never eat at this coco's again in my life, I can't stand poor customer service or just poor service altogether."
1,"Don't use them. Had to call after no response from message previous day to ask if they had installed drip line to plants I paid to have installed. Website states they run irrigation but they claim they don't. Headed out of town so good thing I called, it's 108 degrees, no water. Poor customer service in my opinion. I'll stick with A&P on Ironwood."
1,"I agree with the low ratings and negative comments.  Some horrible change has happened to the menu and I will no longer eat at Pete's.  I visited the 4121 N. 44th St. Phoenix location faithfully.  Until I hear different, goodbye Pete's Fish and Chips.  You will be spoken of in past tense because that's where you are, in the past.  I am curious as to why there is a drastic change."
1,"This place pretty much sucks.  \n\n1.  They lied about when breakfast was served.\n2.  There was only about 20 dishes, so no variety.\n3.  With number 2 in mind, I paid $18, which isn't worth it.\n\nYou're better off eating at MGM Grand's Buffet or the Rio, where it does cost a little bit more, but you get more for your money.\n\nDon't eat here.  Oh yeah, the server was rude as well."
1,NEW YORK NEW YORK ESPN! God awful food! The best beer you can get here is anchor steam.  Avoid their boneless buffalo wings at all costs.  Even my friends that eat just about anything anywhere couldn't even believe how bad the food was here.  No wonder they're all closing down! HAha Disney... Better luck next time!
1,"I have traveled a lot in my day. Been to many a ports for air travel and this one just didn't flow. Traffic jams in the cab, security line, terminal walkway, and plane runway. Get there ahead of time so you can rock out with your tunes to all these jams."
1,"Maybe I just had a one-off bad experience, but I had the most disappointing meal in quite some time.\n\n My pork was lukewarm and flavorless -almost tasted a bit soupy. The rest of my food was pretty cold.\n\nOverall, it reminded me of dorm food.\n\nI'd be willing to give them a second chance, but I'll need some convincing."
1,"Can you say incompetence? I came here with a group of friends one Friday night and it was a terrible way to start the weekend! The service was fishy at best. I don't know if it was a language barrier or what but they messed up on every single one of our orders.  When our food finally arrived they said it was time for our group to leave because we had \""exceeded\"" our time limit. Are you kidding me exceeded our time limit?! We wouldn't have exceeded our time limit if you had gotten one of our orders right! with so many better options for sushi in this area, its a wonder this place is still in business."
1,"I ordered an 8 piece boneless meal. 3 Cajun, 5 hot Togo. What I got was 4 Cajun and 4 mild, which were also incredibly dry. Not happy at all."
1,This was my 1st time and am disappointed . My legs were not waxed neatly and left small scars on my knee and eyebrow while using the tweezer .  The one who did was v nice and friendly but wat matters most is how the Job's done . I have posed two pics have a look at that
1,"If I could give this place a 1/2 a star I would. I never will get anyone who thinks $10 for a burger in this town is 'OK' or an eight dollar shake. I used a groupon and it still cost my wife and I $20+ bucks. There's  way better places in this town to have a out of this world burger, and folks this ain't one of them. \n  First if all I hate spending this kind of dough when I'm not being served. Second our food sat in a window for 5 min while some guy took over 3 orders. \""really guy\"" come on. This location sucked ball ass too. Place Station sucks. Non-Union. It shows.  I have another shit-poun for this place I won't be using. Johnny Rockers. More like Johnny Crockers. I was like why do people think this is so great? I should of read the Yelp reviews before I bought 2 groupons to this shit hole. Won't happen again. After reading the reviews people had the same complaints. Way over priced. \n People always think the more expensive it is the better it is. Not in this case. I felt the more I got ripped off."
1,"is it possible to give zero stars? if so i would. both jill and her receptionist, cindy, are EXTREMELY unprofessional. they are unresponsive. they will send you rude text messages. the receptionist gives you the WRONG  time for your appointment and jill will chew you out for it, with absolutely nasty text messages. she is always angry. and lastly, i have gone multiple times, and this hair removal STILL has not worked after around ten treatments. this is not the right place to go. ZERO stars."
1,"The place looked like  a  junkyard, way too over priced and the people that works there gave me the Creeps."
1,"I hate to disagree with my fellow Yelpers, but my husband and I were so disappointed with this place. The decor is beautiful, just intimate enough, but it was ruined by the obnoxious entertainment coming from the lounge!  It was difficult to carry a conversation and the performer was terrible!  And, we were seated at a booth and could hear the noise coming through the wall from the kitchen!  The only thing worse than the noise, was the food. Under seasoned calamari and undercooked pasta.  The service was the only remarkable part of the evening. Top notch staff!  Hopefully they can match their food to the service someday."
1,"First time at DC Steak House and most likely my last.  Had the strip steak and it was OK, no complaints.  No matter how good the food could of been, the terrible service by \""Danny\"" ruined it all.  Believe we were there for almost 45 minutes before we even ordered dinner.  Thought maybe he was fired a couple of times since we didn't see him for so long.  It was a Sunday and not busy so could only imagine how bad things are on a Friday or Saturday.  A friend of mine that works in the industry called and spoke with a manager and guess he really didn't much care.  So, glad business is good that you do not have to care!  There was a group of 7 of us and this place will probably not see any of us any time soon.  Keep up the awful service and not caring and I'm more than happy to take my business elsewhere."
1,"Absolutely horrible service.  They lost our name on the waiting list, and didn't seat us until out party of 4 had waited 40 minutes and asked the hostess. Our waitress was sarcastic, rude and horribly slow.  Food was ok, my eggs were cold, and the portions are too big. They should be donating their extras to a homeless shelter or something...  What should have been a meal that lasted about an hour ended up lasting 2.5 hours because service was so poor"
1,"I have been a customer of Fletchers since 2007.  I have a friend that offered to look at my breaks, because my car has been shaking. I had my breaks done at Fletchers last June, so you would think everything should still be good. Nope!  They speaking turned the rotors, but they didn't.  They never took them off, they still had the same screw's on. They charged us $20 for each turned rotor. What ever you do don't go to Fletchers.  They are crooks, especial if you are a woman."
1,"We ordered lechon for Christmas and it was by far the worst lechon I have ever tasted. The skin was not crispy and it was way too salty. Our guests hardly touched the lechon. And what is the deal with the box they put the lechon? It had shoe marks all over it!!!! Im thinking it was a box that was on the floor, they walked over it and they assembled it and put the lechon inside. Unbelievable!!!!"
1,"I really want to like deejai and I've been four or five times to try to build the relationship that just isn't there. Every time I've eaten here the server doesn't write down my order and, predictably, messes it up big time. And then offers nothing more than a \""sorry.\"" \n\nThese have all been simple orders like pad Thai with chicken, pad see ew with tofu, etc. One time the pad Thai came out at the highest spice level because, according to the server, when I didn't specify the heat level he just assumed I'd want it as spicy as possible. My dish originally arrived much later than my husbands and then by the time the server brought out a revised dish (the first one's spice was UNBEARABLE), my husband had already finished his dish and what was supposed to be a lovely dinner together was, well, ruined. \n\nAnother time the dish I ordered with tofu came out with chicken. I told the waiter server this and he apologized and asked if I wanted him to send it back. It was almost 10pm on a Friday and the kitchen was closed so I said I'd just deal with it. \n\nIn my opinion, when these type of thing happen, the restaurant should offer some kind of peace offering - a coupon, discount, free drink - something! Deejai did not and with prices like that, it simply isn't worth it for me to keep trying to love it. Sorry, deejai!"
1,"I purchase 6 laser treatments for my face and had to request a before and after pic. I did not notice any difference even after receiving the last of those treatments.  In addition, they suggested that I get 3 AFT treatments.  I have only had 2 of those treatments and those i did see a difference.  The technicians that did the treatments were all very skilled and good.  However, with having to deal with the long wait and not being able to book an appt for weeks out and then they have mix ups with the actual confirmed appointments like wrong date or times.  Now I don't know if thats something that is wrong with their book or a dyslexic thing with the scheduling person or what but if you are going to get any services done here, make sure you request your appointment to be written down and if you have to reschedule, make sure you have it emailed to you to be certain you have it in print.  Another suggestion is to book first thing in the morning so you don't have to wait for a long time.  I will try another med spa or an actual dermatologist for other services of this nature and hope to get quality service at a fair price with no scheduling hiccups."
1,This place SUCKS! NO CUSTOMER SERVICE! payed for a suite with a king bed and they give me a room with 2 queen beds! After try to up sell me at check in! Classic!
1,"thats it, I am fed up with this fucked up theatre not having any air conditioning when it is 104 degress outside. ...I go to a movie for the cool air conditioning . What gives with the mgmt? ????"
1,"We were their last night between 5:30 to 6:30 p.m with friends , the noise from the bar area was terrible  . Even worse was the food we had, not one person at our table had a meal that they said they enjoyed. ! We had Izaiah  as our waiter and he offered to get us something else but we were afraid to try something else ."
1,"ok so went to Island Sushi last night and ordered a saimin and a mini tonkatsu.  First of all, we were the only ones in there, our order took over 15 minutes to come out, our  tonkatsu came out first and when we opened our plate, there was 5 tiny pieces of tonkatsu.  ARE YOU SERIOUS?  we just sat there staring at the plate saying are you kidding, are they serious?  we asked the worker if this was really the order, she said yes, they give one piece for a mini!  we had to laugh...then our saimin came out and was not even hot, we had to ask them to put it in the microwave.  this place has gone downhill and I guess that's what they do, suck you in with the food and then they rip you off!  We love their food but seriously, what's next?"
1,"I was going to buy something for my wife in this LV, but one sales representative was extremely rude to us. Stepped out for another LV immediately."
1,"Worst club experience ever!! I live in Las Vegas and meet some friends at Marquee. Within the first 10 minutes of being there my purse was stolen, I will take partial responsibility because I brought my purse into a club but security was terrible when I tried to file a report. Also, climbing three stories of stairs in heels is was a horrible  inconvenience!!! \n\n**Caution - I saw drunk patrons fall down the stairs!! There was still no support elevator for people too drunk to walk down the stairs."
1,"Total Crap. I should have known when I walked in and there was no one in the place and Kid Rock's \""Born Free\"" was blasting. Those signs should have been enough to deter me but the hope of a delicious Primanti Bros style sandwich was too tempting. After sitting down and looking at the menu that was printed out on a 40 dollar printer purchased from Walmart (the logo on the cover was pixelated, whatever moron did their \""graphic design\"" is top notch) I quickly ordered that \""Capicola\"" sandwich. When the food finally came, I took a bite and couldn't even get through the rubbery meat that was supposedly deli fresh. Whatever the meat was really is beyond me because it certainly wasn't Capicola. It was thick and fatty and chewy, all things which Capicola is not.... I can't go on anymore and waste any more time talking about this horrible establishment that probably won't still be in business by the time anyone reads this review. A final note though, do yourself a favor and stave off falling into a deep depression by staying out of this place."
1,"The worst dry cleaners!!!\n\nI tried this place because it was close to my work - what a mistake! They took a brand new pair of $85 dark gray dress pants and turned them pink all over the knees and legs. They said that it was sun damage and they would try their best to remove the pink stains. I explained to them the pants were brand new and they still argued with me. They tried to remove the stains, but they did not come out.  They did NOT replace my pants either and now I'm out $85."
1,"Compared to Korean food in other cities, the offerings in Champaign-Urbana are quite dismal.  Unfortunately, Woori Jib falls within this category.  Sampling of the \""standard fare\"" (Bulgolgi, spicy tofu soup, mackerel, etc.) revealed that is food is not seasoned well, much of the BBQ is rather fatty, and overall quite \""rough\"" and unappealing in appearance."
1,"We ate lunch here on a 2 week business trip because we were running out of options for a quick lunch that wasn't fast food. This was the worst lunch we had during the trip.  Terrible service and terrible food.  I got the shrimp entree with mixed vegetables of broccoli, mushroom, onion, zucchini and sweet carrot. Absolutely terrible.  I have never had overcooked stir fry before, it was mushy and disgusting.   Shumai dumplings were the worst I've ever had.  My friend had a similiar meal, I think with chicken.  The 3rd party had sushi that she didn't really eat so I'm not sure what the verdict was on that.  On top of the terrible food, it was over priced so we paid $23 each for food that sucked and regretted wasting our per diem there."
1,Don't eat here! They make everyone check in on their phone to get the 10% off. Not one per table.
1,"So sick of WAITING while tables sit empty & the \""cutsie\"" little greeter girls act like they are working. No idea of organization or time management. Used to love this one but not anymore.  After waiting, kids meals came when we were done eating and they were stone cold!  The one manager is very condescending & could care less.  Could be a major reason this Applebee's is going downhill.  I'll be happy to drive to north Scottsdale or even Elliot. They both have more responsible employees & managers that care."
1,"Dont get me wrong this place has their good & bad days depending on who you get and what you are getting. And I've only been happy with one persons work in there, everyone else was (untalented) im sorry to have to say and I've been handed a nail file before because they didn't know how to shape a pointy nail the right way. But I can only say I've been happy with my nails twice here and thats only when I pay $50 and up for my set of nails. You get what you pay for at this place if your not willing to pay the scottsdale price your going to walk out of there with something you HATE! Now on to my toe nails, Ive gotten gel before and I walked out with cuts by my toe nails because how rough they are with the file. They are not gentle and rush to get people in and out. Most of the people working here dont care about the quality of their work, and trust me it shows, I have had my fair share of bad experiences here! And I continued to go here hoping I would get the same person that did great work and the convenience of how close it is to me. Since I cant manage to remember her name I apologize I can't say who, but for the gentleman working in the front I give him a thumbs up for his AMAZING customer service. Very friendly thankyou for that!"
1,So I went to this place to get a shake. So I ordered a taro shake and was watching them make it. As I was watching I see that the cashier started cleaning so he took a rag started wiping the garbage can the took the same rag and wiped the counter tops there was another lady there who was seeing exactly what I saw and looked at each other in awe like WTF!!!!!  What's  wrong  with this guy does he know what he just did!! Sorry but that's disgusting. Took the shake and threw it straight in the garbage and left. Told my wife what happened and she was in disbelief as well.
1,"This location did nothing to help our Christmas dinner. After ordering a holiday meal online this previous Friday, my mother in law was looking forward to picking up her order for Christmas Eve. When at the store, she was told that they didn't have her food order and after waitng 30 minutes, they wouldn't be able to get her any food for another 45 minutes to an hour. We already had guests at home waiting for food so we did not choose to wait. I understand this is a holiday and a busy time for restaurants, but this was simply unprofessional especially to someone in the restaurant industry. We will not be ordering from Mimi's again unfortunately."
1,When I'm in the dumps my wife picks me up a piece of cheesecake. The slices have gotten so small and prices so high... Won't be back. \nThey also did not respond to complaint on Twitter. \nBye bye Cheesecake Factory
1,"I had enjoyed eating in their restaurant several times so when I got engaged they were a natural choice to be our caterer. We were very quickly disappointed. The owners were rude in their interactions with us and seemed uninterested and even annoyed every time we had to communicate with them. We had a difficult time even setting up a time to do our food tasting and then when we finally got to the tasting we were handed a to go box with 3 of the 6 different things we were supposed to taste. A microwaved meal is never going to give a great impression. No one followed up with us to ask how the food was.\nNow, 3 months away from the wedding we have decided to switch gears and pick a new caterer. Thank goodness our deposit is still refundable.\nIf you are looking for a decently priced caterer with no customer service - go for it."
1,"Nothing compared to O'Hare.  This place was busy, but that's no excuse not to be clean.  I used two of the nastiest bathrooms I've ever seen while waiting on my flight (my husband said the men's bathroom was equally bad) . \n\nAnd what kind of an airport doesn't have a McDonald's?!?  Everything was WAAAAY over priced (food wise, $11 for a cold cut prepackaged sandwich!). Give me a break!  \n\nWon't be flying through here again unless I don't have another option."
1,I would give them a zero if I could.  The owner was rude and unhelpful when I tried to narrow down when the tech would be there.  I have tenants freezing in my rental property and she could care less.  She said between 12-3 and I called to see when at 2:00 when nobody had showed.  I asked if she could call the tech and if he could call in way so we would know.  She yelled NO and offered no assurance if when I could expect him to show up.  I told her make it 2:30 or forget it.  She said no so I hung up.  She consequently called me at 2:30 stating in an almost joyful tone that she was canceling the appr.  Good luck getting any business when you treat people in this manner.
1,They are the most unprofessional business I have ever had to deal with. The scheduling is a nightmare....back and forth emails that never ended in a solution. They are obviously not into putting their customers first or providing excellent services. Once you purchase the services from them through Groupon the money is immediately taken from your credit card but then you have to wait 2 months to even get on the schedule. Then the week of your appointment they send an email to reschedule and word it as if you are the one that needs to reschedule. I wish I would have read the other negative customer reviews about The Cleaning Solution before I purchased this waste of time!
1,"HORRIBLE!!!!!!!\nWent there today for lunch! Was really excited and everything looked pretty good. I picked up my first plate and there was a BABY cockroach on it!!!!!!! If there are babies, there are parents! I called for the server to come over. She picked up the plate with it, knocked the roach on the ground and stomped it in from of me. I had already had enough. I went straight to the counter and got a full refund!!!!!! NEVER going there again. Safe your money!"
1,"OMG, I'm the first to review this place.  My accountant is nearby, so we stopped here for breakfast.\n\nLet's just say I won't be going back - for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Who ever heard of ala carte breakfasts?  Order eggs and toast is a dollar extra?  Juice glasses are a bit larger than a shot glass.\n\nIt's now after 1pm and my stomach is still gurgling!  Time for another dose of Pepto!"
1,"They don't even deserve 1 star. The asshole behind the counter, after already purchasing beverages and drinking them, refuses to give my mother just a little water to take medication. He said \""refills are $1 or you can buy a bottle of water for $1\"". I told him again, we've already purchased drinks, she needs a little water to take medication. He then angrily pulls out a clear plastic cup and LITERALLY put (the fountain water, so it shouldn't be an issue) ONE CENTINMETER in the cup. Are you effing kidding me?! So I told him again it's for her medication and he doubled his serving. This is completely unacceptable. It goes against all laws (at least in California) to not provide water for medication. His name is Jeremy R. He is tall and skinny with very short/shaved brown hair."
1,"With great relish, the Salt Lick has moved on to greener pastures.\n\nThe issue with here was definitely the seasoning...there were none. I'll always remember this experience last year, I ordered the ribs while my eating companion ordered the brisket...both tasted exactly alike. The sides had ZERO taste to them and the condiment BBQ sauce was extremely watery. I'll admit that I am a fan of Memphis BBQ styles, I did not expect Texas style to be so wildly different. The service also bothered me, we waited a total of 35 minutes to receive our check...not including our eating, prep, sides, and ordering times. I hope the owners learned well because this was a miss on many others' tastebuds. But I will leave this review with one saving grace, the sweet tea was a bit above average."
1,"Pizza not that great; sometimes burned; and the salad  not fresh, and looks old; dry, and the service is really bad; either the real server is out and not at work yet,  and when you find someone, she won't take the order as she is doing something else, and so I should wait for this supposedly real server, or  they chat in one corner, and takes a long time for someone to come to your table;   it is highly chaotic- am not going back there. Odd service; it;s a good place for kids, I guess. They need to replace this place with professional people; or who really enjoys working there."
1,"Slow unaware rookie bartenders & staff in general, more concerned about taking shots than helping customers, definitely do not recommend this place."
1,"Once in a while, it's possible that a restaurant can have a bad night. Like going on your first date with spinach on your front tooth. But three nights in a row is not a fluke; it's an art. \nMy first night, I ordered their Brooklyn Spaghetti and meatballs. Had I been a Brooklyn wise-guy, somebody would be missing a knee-cap.  They served it in a soup bowl, which was appropriate for the water in the bottom. The \""garlic bread\"" was subbed with some kind of flat bread with garlic butter on it.\nService was minimal, and the waiter must have been on his first week of employment-- Anywhere.\nSo I gave them another chance the next night, and ordered a sizzling platter. Served with a Filthy handle cover, and a rusty, or dirty knife.\nThird times a charm: Spaghetti again. Forgot the cheese. The white bread that was substituted for garlic toast, wasn't even toasted. The waiter said he was sorry, and he was right.\nCleanliness wasn't an option, or a concept known to them.\nSuffice to say it had  all the old world charm of Tijuana."
1,"Not great....even for Queen Creek. Been there twice. 1st time the deep dish good but not nearly as good as Oreganos. Tonight we tried the thin crust but it was horrible. Sausage and toppings ok but the crust was hard as concrete. Complained to waitress but she said they're always cooked like this....if you want a softer crust then you need to order it that way! I have good teeth girl...I just want a pizza to eat without a serrated steak knife.  Wow....special!  Garlic bread so so. Same your money and hit up something else. Maybe I'm too picky because Rudy's, Filbertos, and many fast food establishments have 4 stars LOL."
1,"Lobster salad comes with free bug.\n\nWe took clients to lunch.  1/3 way through my lobster salad, a lady bug crawled out from beneath the greens.  ugh.  We sent it back.\n\nI wasn't really impressed with the other dishes.  They weren't bad, just not memorable.\n\nI was a bit surprised the manager didn't come by the table to apologize, and perhaps offer desert or something ... no one acknowledged the bug.  Yes, it was *only* a ladybug, but still ...  Even worse, they didn't remove the item from the bill.\n\nSince it was a client lunch I didn't want to make an issue of it.  But, for the $ I would have expected better service.\n\nI will give huge props to the general manager.  After reading my survey feedback on my experience, he promptly contacted me (on a weekend, no less).  He was very nice and they did adjust the bill quite a bit more than just removing the salad.  5 stars for him and his attempt to make it right.\n\nWithout the bug incident, I still would just give the place 2.5 stars.  Not really worth the cost.  \n\nSorry, Julian Serrano."
1,"I went to the place for the first time with a friend. Hard to find. Had to go into a shop to get directions even though we had GPS. Once there it was empty... completely empty for a normal lunch hour. We are both hippie eaters, whole foody kind of girls. There was nothing on the menu we found interesting that we couldn't have made ourselves and while I was on the groupon/fine dining list, it still was outrageously expensive. We shared a salmon dish, tiny and bland with globs of sour cream and capers thrown on top.  The quinoa (that was extra) was so cold we found it hard to eat. The waitress was super nice, if a little over attentive (read: bored) and we could not decide what to eat since we have all those ingredients at home. It was $30 for a main course that was not even an appetizer in size when shared, and my friend had one coffee. We tipped 20% but while we are both into bringing organic food into the world more and more, we could not perceive how this place can continue to exist. I think that the cost of owning a place this nice: as it is a really super nice interior, really classy must be way beyond allowing this little business to survive."
1,"I went here twice with my friends, both turned out to be disaster. Their siu-mai tasted so weird. It like they cooked with ruber band or something. Also, their chicken feet tasted not so good compared to Phoenix Place in Chandler. \nI would not come back to this place again. If you would like to try every best dim-sum, I would recommend Great Wall at 35th and Camelback in phoenix."
1,"I've tried to eat here twice.  The first time, at 9:30 PM, there was a huge line and a long, long wait to get in.   Went to the Victorian Room at Bill's instead.\n\nThe second time, I arrived at the entrance only to be told by the manager on duty that the restaurant was closing early because \""it was so slow\"", and they wouldn't let me in.  What a crock of BS!  Closing early in Vegas????\n\nThat was the last chance I am going to give the place, so I'll just have to be satisfied with reading everyone else's reviews."
1,"Although there IS a great selection the owner is very ignorant when it comes to prices (on the punk stuff). None of the items are priced and he will \""size you up\"" and give you (very HIGH) prices after he checks you out to see what he can get out of you. Good stuff but a RIP OFF! I would avoid unless you just want to look.\nBill"
1,"SO GLAD THIS PLACE HAS BEEN SHUT DOWN. Reading about the sanitation violations reported by inspectors kind of makes me want to tear my insides out.\n\nI can't understand how this place got three and a half stars; the only explanation that comes to mind is that Vegas isn't the prime place for Asian food, but I don't think it's that unreasonable for people to have taste buds, much less standards.  Orchids boasted of its giant dining and 24-hr dim sum service, but from what I could tell, that was the source of all its problems. It was near impossible to flag down carts with their ill-tempered servers, and the food was usually lukewarm, sometimes even cold. Reminiscent of mass processed foods, dim sum here was oily, skimpy, and of such poor quality I could barely tell meat from grease. The room is pure chaos, noisy and unorganized, with empty tables sitting uncleared, piled with dirty dishes. All this, for more than $20 per person. I could barely eat. \n\nThis has been the biggest disappointment yet, given my impression from Yelp. Peeps, please be more aware of what you're eating before you review."
1,AAA yellow cab is clueless.  I set up a time to be picked up and they made me miss my flight because they only dispatched 1 taxi to pick me up when the Mesa airport was 5 minute from my house and I had to wait on phone over 25 minute to get them to dispatch a taxi that would pick me up.  I missed my flight home to WA state and now I have to arrive home 5 hours later while kids are already asleep. I wouldn't recommend to anyone....
1,"This is not a very good Fletcher's.  Even within Fletcher's, most will admit this location sucks.  I too dropped off my car for what turned into an all day oil change.  I had a coupon when I dropped it off at 9:30.  The guy took my keys, told me to keep my coupon and said it was logged in the system.\n\nCome 4:00 PM I had to call and got the, \""oh yeah the car is just finishing up.\""  But while they had me on the phone of course they  \""discovered\"" a good $400 in $hit that just didn't need to be done to hit they daily sales quota.  \n\nAir filter, coolant flush, decarb, etc., etc.  Wasn't quite sure how they would do all this, within the one hour before closing, but I shut him off like a light switch.  When I went for pick up a different guy gave me a hard time because I didn't bring the coupon back.  Geez sorry I could be your sucker of the day to help you get your sales SPIF :)\n\nThis is a very bad attempt at customer service by upselling you on crap your car doesn't need. \n\nWhen I brought it in, I was complaining about a rattle in my front tire, their solution was the tire was scraping the plastic.  Hmmm...   Our advice...go elsewhere."
1,"Didn't love it. I was in pain and decided to give it a try. I was really looking for just a foot massage. Instead I got a weird, rough, kind of all over massage. I really just wanted my feet and legs massaged but he really only spent a few minutes on that. I won't do this again and wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends."
1,"Thoroughly disappointing! Guess I've been spoiled by so many great \""newer\"" restaurants in town. This place's been around for awhile and somewhat \""iconic.\"" Good location to meet up for a lunch meeting but other than location, it's not a place I'll go for food. Our food lacked freshness and taste overall."
1,"Last time I went there the food is very bad.  Fried chicken was head and dry, sinigang na isda has lots of Bones the fish is not fresh, most of the food are cold the shrimp or meat that they put in the dish is very frugal never will I go back there again.  Sorry!"
1,"I brought my dog here thinking it would be a better experience then at Petsmart but when I walked in, I already had a bad vibe and wish I would have just stuck to my gut instinct. When I picked him up, his nails were bleeding and I wasn't informed that he was bleeding. I didn't notice until we got home and there was blood all over the carpet and couch. His haircut looked super uneven and it was only $10 cheaper than Petsmart. I definitely recommend just spending the extra money and taking your animal to a place where you know they will take care of your dog as if he is their own. I wouldn't mind the bleeding so much if they had informed me and maybe apologized but nope...nothing."
1,The food was just OK but over priced. The service or the lack there of was enough for us to never go back.  It is clear that its management has zero knowledge and experience in customer service.
1,"Pedro, if I could give you negative stars I would. Steven L from MA, said it all. This is rated as Best of Madison?? It shows what is going on in Madison and how very little the people of Madison know about food or quality thereof.\n\nThis place is disgusting! The food is abhorrent. A black bean and cheese burrito with no cheese?? The black beans tasted like they came out of a can of Bush's baked beans. Pedro, you owe me $20.00 back. Seriously. A wet steak burrito that had NOTHING but six strips of steak and a lot of horrible sauce inside a tortilla shell? Are you kidding me? I can get more authentic Mexican from Old El Paso.\n\nJust avoid this place at all costs. There is nothing good about Pedro's, there is nothing Mexican about Pedro's."
1,"1 star mostly for the concept of all u can drink bloody marys and mimosas at brunch.  Too bad we couldn't stand to hang out any longer to get close to $18 worth, each...  Thanks for trying to make one Jane, but it wasn't any good.\n\nThis place is a joke.  Food was poorly executed, especially since we were in an empty dining room, listening to musac.  Poahed eggs were hard as rocks and the omelet was rubbery and dry.  $72 for brunch.\n\nOwner/ manager walking around with a bloody mary in his hand (I guess I would be getting drunk too if my business was failing), instead of paying attention to his surroundings.  I think they pay more in linen for the dining room then they do their kitchen staff.\n\nMy Louisiana girlfriend is embarrassed that this place even exists..:"
1,If I could do 0 stars I would. Took 45 minutes to bring 3 sandwiches when they weren't even busy. Then my appetizer that I was having as my meal came 25 minutes later. 2 of the orders were wrong and you can tell that food was left under a heat lamp for a while. There was no reason for the food to take as long as it did there was no food coming out of the kitchen prior to ours. It was ridiculous! I used to love this place but not anymore!
1,"The worst service I have ever had in my life.  We asked about the fixed menu for 12.99 and the waiter was so rude my mouth dropped open.  My fiance and I were so put off, we got right up and headed out the door.  We ended up heading to Johnny Smalls where we had excellent service and amazing food.\nAgo- it doesn't matter how good your food is, horrible service will put a bad taste in anyone's mouth."
1,"The pizza was so bland I couldn't believe it was from Sbarro.  The gentleman's body language behind the counter was that of a person who couldn't care any less and seemed put off by basic questions about the menu.  Not to mention, thug tattoos everywhere.\n\nOh yeah, 6 bucks for one slice and almost 8 bucks for a beer.  Trust me, go somewhere else."
1,"The fate of this company was entirely brought on by the owner(s).  There were 3 guys, the white guy was almost never there, and the other guy that was usually there with his family was not the most friendly.  They nickle and dime you to death because they don't know how to get enough business to make money.  Their marketing is awful; my wife and I even promised the family that we would get them a spot to sell food down at UNLV; for free!  Do you think they ever responded to our emails or took us up on our genuine offer; nope.  They spread their business way too thin; opening up two locations, and they weren't customer service orientated at all......they would almost never give refunds and refused to hear complaints about their food.  Good riddens to bad rubbish; I'm referring to the owners of course."
1,"My doctor had just retired and I had little choice but to visit a \""doc in a box\"" for an infected toe and this was close to work.  There wasn't even a doctor on the premises in the middle of the afternoon on a week day.  I was seen by a physician's assistance who barely even looked at my toe, gave me an antibiotic prescription, and sent me on my way.  My toe got much worse and I ended up seeing a specialist for fungus that was now invading my tissue.  Terrible medical service and I will NEVER go to another FastMed.  I wish me and my insurance company had our $295 back - yes, almost $300 for the non-doc's glancing look.  Good luck if you visit here - you're going to need it."
1,"Hmm. I don't really know how to review this place. We came this morning for the champagne brunch with a pretty large party. The line was pretty long, but it went quickly and they were able to seat us relatively fast considering the size of our party. \n\nThere were many pros to this buffet. Once seated, our server quickly took our drink orders and we were able to go get our food. They have a pretty good variety of options and it's organized well. There seemed to be something for everything. The food was ok as well. \n\nNow, onto the con and it's one heck of a con. I unfortunately caught sight of a roach on the line, right on the waffle, biscuit and corned beef hash station and that obviously stopped my appetite in it's tracks. That's unforgivable in my book, I won't be back."
1,"I wouldn't go back here. I haven't received my glasses. I placed an order for some glasses and paid. They said it would take a month before I saw them.  Well... my order was placed 04/07 it is now 05/15. I called them last week at the one month mark, since I hadn't heard from them and wanted to check the status of the order. Their response was \""oh we were going to call you today\"", then said they would call me back once they had my info up. They didn't call me back. I waited 2 hours and called them back myself... At this time they finally told me it was back ordered and that they couldn't provide me with any info as to when I would get them. The girl who answered than informed me that they were closing and would have to call back... Hmmm really? Their customer service needs definite improvement. I am not even upset with the fact that it's taking long it's just the lack of concern for their customers that bothers me."
1,Horrible service over charged the group I was with that was 12 ppl with adding on 10bucks on everyone's bill and when it was brought to there attention they didn't know what to say I'll never go back to this place again and if u like getting horrible hookahs and getting over charged then u would love it here!!
1,"Stay away from Olympic Garden unless you are a SUCKER!  This is the worst strip club in Vegas! \n\nThis place will flat out rip you off any chance it gets.  We showed up there at about 2 a.m. and the place was dead.  We paid $30 each for a cover charge and there were NO GIRLS dancing.  We waited and waited and waited...nothing.  Finally we asked the manager and he said the girls would \""be right out.\""  Ten minutes later, still nothing.  Four drinks and $80 later at the bar...still NO GIRLS.   WTF!\n\nFinally we walked to the front and asked for our money back.  Yeah right!  The manager was a total asshole.  Finally two butt-ugly girls walked out and offered to give us a lap dance...we laughed and went to another club.\n\nYou should do the same."
1,This place is ridiculous. We showed up and waited an hour which was the allotted time they gave us. So we inquired and they said another 15 to 20 minutes. Which we again waited. We inquired again and we're told 15 to 20 minutes. Not sure who they think they think has 2 hours to wait to be seated but at least be honest with your customers. Doubling your wait time is unacceptable for a fast food place little lone a $40.00 place
1,"Truly the worst Ihop I have ever been to!!!  There was a waitress that was walking around sweating buckets of sweat while serving, not appetizing at all.  The food came out cold and looked completely unappetizing.  My husband got a Western Omlet--it had a little cheese and a few pieces of ham and literally NO ingredients iside, just all egg.  My food was awful, cold-it looked like they reused it from the last person that probably left it on the table uneaten.  Ugh, will never go there again."
1,We  went tonight after the Super Bowl\nFox Sports was on and when it was over Glee came on\nWe were the only customers left in the place and wer waiting patiently for our Pizza\nGlee was on for 1/2 hour \nThe Owner came over and just changed the channel\nHe said it was their policy\nMaybe that is why at 8 pm they have no customers\nThe Pizza was ok\nWe will not return\nWe won't give money to someone who is that Rude\nI feel for his Employee's as if he is like that with the Customers I can only imagine what he would be like to work for
1,"No more Coolatta. The Coolatta machine is broken. At all locations, apparently. Why the (*bleep*) are you still selling Coolatta if the machine's broken? Does corporate office know they're scamming customers? Horrible customer service."
1,Horrible service!!\nSmells like a dam nursing home!!\nFreezing cold had to ask for them to shut the door!\nFood is not good.
1,"This is a bar trying to be more. The small plates were heavy and riffs on burgers and fries. The beer selection is what you would find at Harris Teeters and is marked up. Go to Gallery 22 if you want an amazing selection of beer, better prices, and a true tapas restaurant upstairs."
1,Horrible hotel! When we pulled up there were 4 police cars with several people in cuffs. There was a pair of underwear in the corner of our room. After we came home there was a charge in my credit card for the mini bar that we didn't even have a key for! This place is run down and not worth the price. They price gouge for everything. Trust me you don't want to stay here!!!
1,"Terribly designed!  This is the worst designed eat and watch luxury theatre I have ever been too.  The ledge is too high, so that if you recline your seat 25% of the movie is cut off!!  I had to sit on the edge of the seat and on my tippie toes to see subtitles.\n\nExperience ruined, and couldn't take advantage of all the nice stuff that they did put in there."
1,Not satisfied.  We used them to rent a house in fort mill. Told them and wrote on the lease concerns that need to be addressed and fixed. Haven't herd from since we moved in. Very dissatisfied. Had I known it would be like this I never would have used them. We spoke with the agent a week after and never returned our phone calls. This is not the way we're used to conducting business. I hope most realtors are more professional than this.\nThanks
1,"Ya, I thought Wynn doesn't allow people to push baby stroller into \""the buffet\"".. I was wrong......We couldn't even step into \""the Wynn\"" with a stroller. The guy told us unless we live in there. That is totally a BS rule. I was controlling my temper and kept on telling myself there must be a reason ppl like Wynn....such as their buffet is so wonderful...and......I was wrong \""AGAIN\"". Their buffet food was nasty. the crab had smell. the lobster was not fresh, the meat was soft and disgusting. I'll never go back to that BS hotel."
1,"We were very much looking forward to eating here. We had the chef's cooking at the Alchemy meal at the Bigelow Grille.We loved it there. Sorry to see him leave. So we were excited about trying Salt. The drink special was horrible.....I sent it back. Not drinkable. They still charged me for it. The cheese plate was good....but no bread or crackers available. Odd. Beet salad was unique with the poached egg. Duck was good, but fatty. The short ribs were VERY fatty. We looked forward to dessert: a choice of ONE. We left hungry and unhappy, and over $100 poorer. Our waitress did not offer us the meal descriptions like the other waitstaff. The chef is a great cook.....we know from his alchemy skills. Please bring it back!"
1,Never coming here again. What a bad experience. Everyone was drugged up. I went to the bathroom and some girl w an X on her hand was banging her head against the wall repeatedly. We got a table and got kicked out before finishing our bottles because I was smoking an electronic cigarette! Are you kidding me?? The people were all rude. I'm in the service industry myself and word of mouth gets around. I will never spend my money here again and I will tell my friends not to either.
1,"Has anyone ever tried to call BC/BS of AZ at their Customer Service number of \n800-752-0193.  They make it nearly impossible to talk to a real person-it is not given\nto you as an option up front.  I held for 10 minutes the first time and a  rep. Mary came on.  I gave her my name and heard a click...she hung up on me.  Called back, \nthis time waiting 15 minutes and finally reached someone to ask a simple question about my policy.  Their phone system never informs the customer how long their wait will be. The music is irritating..the kind you would chose to dissuade people from holding.  Unless, one has worked in customer service and repeatedly asks for customer service over the recording..its a hard process to talk to anyone.  Customers who pay them thousands in premiums each year should have easier access to their insurance company."
1,"Pretty rude service, employees act like they don't wanna be there. Location wise nice store and food quality like any other subway"
1,"Sweet reply, from the swapmeet employee but think about this- charging a 10$ minimum is still extortion. (An excessive or exorbitant charge.)"
1,"What will I remember about the \""new\"" Tropicana?  I won $30 bucks and I lost $30. But most of all, the fat ugly Asian cocktail waitress asked the two WHITE people directly to either side of me if they wanted drinks, but blatantly ignored me.  Jacked up because they arrived at the slots much, MUCH later than me.  She watched them BOTH just sit down, and still didn't ask me her next round and only asked them AGAIN."
1,"We heard good things about the food, so stopped in for lunch- party of 4, including a toddler. The server directed us to a table near the door, but we asked for a booth that seated 4 instead. We got the distinct feeling she didn't want us sitting there. She did bring us menus, but that was it. She repeatedly serviced the table RIGHT NEXT to us, turned her back to us, and completely ignored us, while waiting on people who were seated after us. After twenty  minutes we got up and left. \n\nIt doesn't matter how good the food is, the waitress completely wasted our time, and we left feeling terrible. Not a pleasant experience at all. DON'T PATRONIZE THIS RESTAURANT!"
1,"If you want regular American food that tastes okay and is the same quality as Denny's, go here and pay 76 dollars for your meal.  All I ordered were chicken strips, a steak, and fried chicken.  And yes--it was 76 dollars. \n\nMediocre food doesn't deserve a good rating, and although edible and an interesting ambiance, it was not worth the money at all."
1,"I was excited that Patron was moving in nearby to where I live however I am ready for them to close and make room for something better.  I was afraid my review would be harsh but every day when I walk by and see the restaurant vacant I'm guessing that there are many others out there who share my opinion.\n\nFirst off, I expected good salsa.  I have no doubt that the salsa came from a wholesale jug.   The chips that accompanied the salsa clearly came out of a box and were disgusting.  I would have rather gone across the street to Chipotle for chips and salsa.  \n\nI ordered a quesadilla for dinner which was lackluster similar to the overall experience.\n\nThis place needs a new menu or at least a chef who understands Mexican beyond prepackaged prepared goods.\n\nOverall I would suggest walking up the street to Mad Mex or go to Chipotle and save some money.  Patron is just not worth it."
1,"Absolutely HORRIBLE. My expectations were already set low when a friend warned me that the food she ate had not been that great at the other locations- but I never imagined it could be so bad. Not only did they forget half of our order the first time- but then each entree came out either cold, incorrect or was just completely missing. Even the three times another waiter came by to double check what was missing and they still got it incorrect! Not sure who is at fault for this when you realize your waitress is the only bartender and server upstairs on a Monday night- but then again she didnt write anything down either. A manager thought it would be good customer service to practically beg us to take other food from the kitchen but frankly we had all lost our appetite at that point. There are many sports bars in Charlotte and I'd rather go to one that has good food, great service and they dont charge you for the food that they messed up on or forgot to bring you."
1,"The food was good.  Terrible service!  If you get a server named Chad, just leave.  He was awful.  And bartender was pretty bad too.  Poured weak drinks and didn't mix them very well."
1,"Took a few garments into this cleaners, specified dry clean only on my denim about 3 times to make sure they knew how important it was. Upon pick up jeans had shrunk and discolored, owner and manager refused to do anything about it, I'm not one to complain and I support local and small business which is why I decided to try this place out, but their lack of customer service was just sad. They didn't offer to replace my jeans, credit me and didn't even give me an apology for their making a mistake."
1,"Stayed here for one night....\n\nDissapointed that you get harassed by the crack heads in the adjacent \""hood\"". When you tell management , they are apathetic. I am willing to give ALL business a shot but when you cant protect your paying customers, you are useless. Never again.  I'd never stay here unless they had ACTIVE security. Otherwise I wasted a night of pre-payment getting out of there."
1,"Can I give a Place no Stars , because that is what this place deserves, they suck NEVER NEVER NEVER go here. I got my A/C fixed and paid 1300 to replace my entire A/C components on my truck in july 2008. In less than a year later, It's broke again (April 2009). They said it was a valve that went out which they replaced. So, they replace that for free. Now, less than a year later again after April 2009 that it's broke in March 2010.  It does not work again. In less than 2 year period, my ac on my truck has broke twice since I got it all replaced. They want to charge me to get it fixed now that the 12 month warranty is over. To top it off they retro fitted my High pressure line with the wrong valve and told me they could not fix that and admitted to putting the wrong valve on it. So, I could not fill is up with Freon to see where it is leaking. I had to buy 60 dollars with of part at auto zone to fix it. It's ridiculous that I paid for my A/C on my truck to be replaced and it breaks every year.   This is about the Sun Devil Auto on Chandler Blvd, Cross Streets Chandler and McQueen but from what I have read on the internet they all SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,This club was a total joke ...the so called event guys (cuz they are way too small to be called bouncers) were rude and unfriendly .  We were on the guest list but they didn't care and they even have some rule that two guys can't stand near a girl in line ..weak! ..terribly represented club ...get some friendlier staff and maybe that will attract a better crowd ...there are so many great clubs to choose from in Vegas so don't make the mistake of wasting your money here ..
1,"Sadly disappointed, poor service and a small amount of meat piled in the center I asked for White American I think she put Cheddar on it.   If I would have saw her doing it I would have stopped her to put something else on it instead but she had her back to me.  I know it's fast food but if you have a tip jar out you better expect I expect a better job then just the one you get paid for!  I probably won't come back I think I would rather get in my car and drive a bit for lunch at work."
1,"So I'd love to write a great review but I'm elsewhere eating dinner and drinking beers. Why? Because my friend and I (both women) could not justify paying a $5 cover to see a fight that 1. We could careless about. 2. Could see up the street for free 3. Could have parked in the parking lot and watched. So, sorry to say we will be spending our money and tipping well here at Gordon Biersch."
1,"This place is PERFECT for those who never made much of their lives and who';s wallets are thin. It's run down, filthy, old, in a bad part of town, and full of Phillipino \""women\"" who had a sex change! I know the \""girls\"", ones name is Cookie. Look out for her, she'll take all your money and leave you with blue balls and an std! They treat their dancers here terrible and nickel and dime them all the time so what is a dancer to do?? They rip off the customers! This place has had it. and that obese troll named Sasha they keep around for God only knows, is a total bitch who doesn't know the first thing about managing her employees. She's seen regularly yelling at them in front of customers!!!! And harrassing the girls for tips! What the hell did that Jaba the Hut do for them??? Don't go here, it sucks. too many other clubs in Vegas to get trapped and conned in this one!"
1,"Terrible customer service. Opened 24hrs yet they can't make coffee or give you old sandwiches. Half the time it's \""cash\""\nOnly. I hate coming here."
1,"DO NOT GO HERE....unless you enjoy spending 200 dollars in under an hour and geting told to leave by  the crack head alcoholic owner. After spending less than an hour and still with wine in our glasses - he walked up and  pulled the table back away from us and said to leave because he had a \""wait\"". I had been there several times and used to reccomend this place but NO way now. I told him that I would no longer support his restaurant with horrible service like that and his response was (in front of my guests and other tables around):\n\n\""You think I care? Look at my wait, get the hell out. Go get laid and quit busting my balls.\""\n\nI hope people don't support service like that because there are a ton of other restaurants in Scottsdale with better service and better food....."
1,"There is DEFINITELY room for improvement in the instructor's approach to treating customers and the company's customer service. That is very clear in Zeb's response to Brittney T. Rather than apologizing and offering her a second chance like any respectable business would do, he not only argued with her but mocked her. That is immature and repulsive. I believe that maybe their teaching approach is a scare tactic. I was only offered to sign up for the unlimited 10 day package which I thought was a STEAL! One class is $16! What's the catch? It must be the attitude/customer service. Or they are discouraging customers to come back and pocketing the extra $4/person. I am not sure what is going on. I would love a good hot yoga class and I would also love to be pushed - that's not what people are complaining about. It is known that Bikram is a discipline. Constructive criticism is necessary. But personal attacks are very un-yoga-like. And I'm sorry, but I cannot honestly recommend this place to anyone. It's a shame."
1,"They don't even deserve a star.\n\n1. They are NOT the cheapest airline if you want to bring luggage with you! For whatever savings you have in flight fare, you have to pay additional $45 for checked baggage or $50 for carry-on! I've never even heard of that!\n2. Terrible customer service. At one point, a flight attendant joked about the safety protocols - if we weren't listening, she wished us good luck if the plane crashed..\n3. If you don't like leg space on the airplane, then this is your airline. But if you're like me and like some space, you won't like Spirit. I'm 5'1'' and even I barely had space to just sit normally. Ridiculous. \n\nDon't use Spirit. Pay the \""extra\"" money to use another flight, and you'll break even with the additional fees Spirit tacks on. Spirit - I want to say a lot of profane things right now but am refraining.. this time. Never again."
1,I am relatively new to Las Vegas. A friend of mine suggested Ritual. I signed up to receive a $20 off coupon as a new client. Conveniently their hair cuts are priced at $60 and the coupon is only on services $65+. I called and asked if they could honor the coupon and their suggestion was to add a $35 deep conditioner. Really? You can't charge me $5 more for a haircut so I can take advantage of the coupon? Clearly you do not want new business. I will not be using Ritual.
1,"Why does the panda express in the mall suck so bad when it's so good at freestanding shops? Is it lazy workers? Food been sitting too long? What is it? It's like obviously i got the orange chicken. Duh. But when i get it at the mall it's all soggy like they just microwaved it. But when i get it at a freestanding store- it's crispylicious! What the wok, panda?"
1,"Horrible. Worst McDonald's ever. I don't understand how the \""machines\"" can always be broken. I stop for a hot chocolate, but no the machine is broken. I stop for a smoothie, but no the machine is broken. I stop for a cookie, but no the machine is broken. I stop for a sundae, but no the machine is broken. I wonder if the machines are really always broken or if these people are just idiots. Officially done with this place."
1,"This was my nightmare home repair experience.  Everything I asked about was a $200 issue, including a toilet flapper replacement.  I ended up buying the $10 flapper myself and putting it in in about 5 minutes. I think the man who came thought I was someone who would just fearfully tell him to do $1000 in repairs.  These are like the car repair crooks you always hear about. I wasted $35 on the coupon but it would have been much worse if I had let that guy touch anything in my house."
1,"Read this before coming to this location because this is worst dining experience I've ever had and I'm in the hospitality business! The wait time was 80 minutes and when we were seated we didn't have straws or silverware for at least twenty five minutes. We repeatedly asked for them and the waiter kept replying that they would but nothing happened until the manager was involved. Our food literally sat in front of us while we stared at it with no silverware and no one was proactive about solving the problem. Our food orders were wrong, refills were very delayed, and to top this whole experience off it was my dad's birthday dinner :( The response at the end of the night was \""sorry, I'll try better next time\"" and barely anything was discounted. We were so excited for this location to open, we literally counted down the days and chose it as the birthday location but we seriously recommend you going to the location on sunset and not this one. They DO NOT have it figured out yet. The location is beautiful but the people they hired are service amateurs."
1,I wonder which escaped convict is going to try to up sell me today. How hard is it to understand I only want an oil change. \n\nEveryone here had a neck tattoo.... And don't even get me started on that guy that jumps on my hood looking for a crack in my windshield. This place is like the 9th ward of car washes.
1,"Diese Bewertung ist f\u00fcr die Filiale in der Scheffeltr. Ich benutze die \nangeschlossene Reinigung, ich habe ein Hemdenabo, das ist sehr g\u00fcnstig \n(35 EUR f\u00fcr 20 St\u00fcck). Am Anfang war alles ok, die Hemden waren \ninnerhalb von 3-4 Werktagen fertig. Die Qualit\u00e4t war einigerma\u00dfen ok. \nSeit einigen Monaten sind die Hemden im Durschnschitt nach 1 Woche \nfertig. Das finde ich zu lange! Damit kann man sich arrangieren, wenn \nman es gut plant, dann klappt alles. Die letzten 3 Wochen waren die \nHemden nach 1 Woche immernoch nicht fertig! Das geht zu weit, die \nServicekraft zeigt kein Verst\u00e4ndnis, bem\u00fcht sich kaum. \nSchade, denn \ndas Waschaus ist direkt neben meiner Wohnung. Ich werde aber ein anderes\nsuchen m\u00fcssen, das besser und schneller ist. Ich bin ja bereit f\u00fcr \nQualit\u00e4t und Service etwas mehr zu zahlen. Das fehlt im Waschhaus in der\nScheffelstr. \nKollegen von mir, die auch dort Hemden abgeben, habe ich auch bereits informiert, die werden auch wechseln.\nAls ich mich bei der Betreiberin telefonisch beschweren wollte war ihre Aussage: Sie zahlen ja 1,60 EUR pro Hemd, mit dem Abo. Dann zahlen Sie doch die Hemden einzeln, 2,50 EUR pro Hemd, dann werden Sie bevorzugt behandelt!! Eine Unversch\u00e4mtheit! Die treuen Kunden mit Abo werden also nicht gut behandelt.\nAllein wegen dieser Aussage gehe ich nie wieder hin!"
1,"this place blows.  management came to my table to blow smoke about the amount of head there should be on my beer. The Turkey pot pie had only 4 pieces of turkey in it and so much salt in it, it raised my blood pressure. frys were cold, scallops were the size of nickels. I have eaten here 3 times before and never had this bad service or food. I am VERY disappointed in the service and management that thinks every one just fell off turnip truck.  very sad Will stick with the LINQ location.  They seem to understand that if \""you don't take care of the customer,  someone else will\""."
1,Went for a sit down meal.  It was self seating and sat by the door.  I was ignored by the host manning the register and the waitress for 5 minutes.  Another patron entered and did self seating and received service in about 3 minutes.  Waitress then got the patron their drink order and finally asked if I was picking up an order.  I replied with nope I an eating in she said okay and proceeded to go about the restaurant to tend to other patrons obviously not having heard my response.  Finally after about 15 minutes total time I decided to leave after never having seen a menu.   \nThere were  about 7 other patrons in the restaurant when I arrived so the busy and seemingly rushed waitress must have been helping with take out orders.  I may give them another shot in the future as I have no clue what the food is actually like.
1,"Ive been a V.I.P. customer and frequent lover of Nakama for over 6 yrs now. I have spent a lot of $$ at this place. Ive always loved their service and food...Until now. My Finace and i were there for my Birthday dinner last night, i ordered my regular meal the way ive ordered it the past 6 yrs. The waitress informs me that i cant order my fried rice without the veggies anymore. I asked to speak with a Manager and a gentlemen named Chris comes to speak with us. (10 min later busy playing online poker) he saus he gets too many complaints from the Chefs that prepare the food about things like this?  I said arent the chefs paid to do what you tell them?  I even offered to pay addtional to have my meal the way i wanted it. I told Chris it was my Birthday and ive spent thousands of dollars here at his establishment.  He didnt care he said its a new rule although its NOT online and not posted anywhere on the menu. We ended up staying and eating my Birthday dinner the way Chris wanted it not me. But this is the last time we will ever be back. Waste of 2 hours driving waste of time ruined.my Birthday dinner. Bad customer service bad business ethics Mr. Chris."
1,"Will never go back! The service was awful & the sandwiches are sloppy, ugly, poor quality messes. Only 1 vegetarian option, old/soggy toppings. Told the counter girl I had not been there before.  She gave no useful information. Told her I am a vegetarian. She made some condescending remark (possible joke but not funny.) Told her TWICE what I did not want on the sandwich, the cook in the window heard me & they still got it wrong. DO NOT go there."
1,"Our group of 4 adults went on the morning of Mar 17.  The concept is appealing and some of the items interesting.  The blacksmith was great.  However this venture is dependant on volunteers and even though this was a Saturday morning there were not enough volunteers to have the \""gun fight\"".  The cost is modest and parking free.  I would not recommend it."
1,"I went here on Christmas eve with a party of 6 for lunch. The place was near empty, yet the chubby server would not let us sit at a bigger table. Instead we were crammed together at a table that had six chairs but should have only had four. The whole time we ate, bumping elbows and all, we stared at the larger table right next to us that no one ever sat at. Thanks a lot."
1,"We bought tickets for the Nye party and was really disappointed for $90pp. It included a table, 3 drinks, half glass of champagne and food. We arrived about 6:45 and only a few tables have sat. We went to get food and they clearly did not have enough. They ran out of meatballs and chicken which meant zero meat left, only pasta. Not enough at all. Then the drinks said online anything but their speciality and shots. Then the tickets you could only use drinks under $7.25...when you add it all up, wasn't at all worth the money. The entertainment was ok. Only two of the six had good voices. Also, they really didn't duel like I have seen at many other dueling piano bars. Needless to say we won't be returning. Place was a rip off."
1,"When I first met my (now) wife, this restaurant is where we went on one of our first dates. The service was good and the food was fantastic. It was a very memorable experience for both of us. Last week we returned to Montreal for the first time in three years and were eager to return to our favorite Chinese buffet. \n\nTo say we were disappointed would be a massive understatement. \n\nThe food looked like it had been sitting out for days. The vegetables were brown and spoiled. The sauces were syrupy and disgusting. The meats were nauseatingly greasy. The store-bought steamed buns were so old they had fused with the paper they were sitting on. \n\nThere was not one dish I can honestly say I enjoyed... and I tried a LOT of dishes. Normally I'd feel guilty at a buffet if I didn't eat everything on my plate before going back for more. Here I felt like I was doing the next guy a favor.\n\nThe place is now wallpapered with advertisements for an assortment of absurdly extravagant alcoholic drinks (we're talking umbrellas, dry ice, and fruit wedges). I have to assume pushing these overpriced novelties is their focus now - serving good food certainly is not.\n\nAbsolutely disgusting. The only redeeming aspect is how quick they are to refill your drink... and you're going to need a lot of refills to wash the taste out of your mouth. Avoid."
1,"I own a property managed by the Osselaer for a little over a year now. I have had problems with my landscaping and have addressed my property manager for the sweetwater vista's as well as a letter to their president. The result? Nothing. It is like I am a joke to them. Their policy? As long as you send in your quarterly check they can go on ignoring you and downsize your simple requests. I am really..how hard is it to trim some bush's and turn on water trips. Sure I do not mind doing those things, I enjoy them actually..but thats what I pay over a $1000 a year for. I dont pay that much money for someone NOT to do their job. When considering a home managed by these people, do yourself a favor. DONT CONSIDER IT. You will be very dissapointed and your needs will not be met."
1,"Went last night, as I was having a salad craving and *THIS LOCATION HAS CLOSED. What a bummer! I still recommend Z as a whole, so check out another location!"
1,Omg if I can give a negative review I would..  I got got a haircut today and I wanted an aline cut with layers on the back. My hair looks like a chopped mess!! I actually didn't want to snap at the lady who cut my hair cause she was older.. and sweet but did not know how to cut hair if her life depended on it. I am so upset my hair looks so horrible... 50$ for a haircut and i still tipped the lady since she will probably get fired for she shouldn't be cutting hair at that salon. She was the Ethiopian older lady with reddish hair. She is the most horrible hair dresser I've been to in my life. I am so heart broken as I will have to wait until I grow out my hair a bit and go somewhere else. I will never come back here and good thing I just recently cancelled my membership to the gym. Good riddance and karma will get these people back. \n\nPs I walked out of the salon and went to home depot after.. while I was in line a sweet lady pointed out I had hair all over my back down to my butt! What kind of business let's someone walk out like this from their salon????????? F you lifespa I never hated a place so much in my life. I wish I can personally write the owner of this place which I probably will.. I will find a way. Fake ass people!!!!
1,"If I do not get sick from the buffet, it might suddenly become worth 2 stars. The highlights were the price and the rubbery beef lo mein. The low lights were everything else, including the fact that the chopsticks gave me splinters."
1,I literally just went to Patron and was completely ignored.  I sat in a beautiful room aside the bar and several servers not only looked at me; but made eye contact then proceeded to ignore me.  I am not sure if I was ignored because I arrived just a few moments prior to their lunch menu ending or if this is just their typical service. I like the food at the other Patron restaurants; but when I can't even get a glass of water what is the point of continuing the meal.
1,"Besides its convenient location near ASU, this place has nothing going for it. My roommates and I would constantly be told the wrong amount of rent that was due. Even though we paid on time every month, we were constantly getting charged late fees. The appliances were terrible, the disposal in the sink never worked even after the \""maintenance\"" came to fix it, which in turn caused the apartment to have a stench. The air conditioner also dripped, which was a lot of fun when they couldn't fix it.\n\nAgain, their excuse for bookkeeping is terrible. While my roommates and I have been moved out for about a month now, we are just now getting charged almost $1,000 for unspecified charges, including the aforementioned \""late charges\"" that we shouldn't have been charged but were because they apparently didn't pass 4th grade math. We paid them anyway because we wanted to be done with this awful place, but they are still saying we didn't pay them. Evidently they just want to drain you of every dollar that you have because they can't keep it straight. We couldn't get out of there fast enough!!\n\nDO NOT LIVE HERE. IT WILL FOLLOW YOU WHEREVER YOU GO UNTIL YOU DUMP YOUR ENTIRE LIFE SAVINGS INTO IT. NOT WORTH IT."
1,"This is the 3rd part that they ordered to try and fix our newer LG dishwasher. Today , almost a month later, their serviceman ID#943 just decided not to show up for the 8-11am appointment. When we called a 4pm to inquire, they did nothing except schedule us for a whole week away. We have been doing dishes now for a month thanks to Sears ( rotten) service. My suggestion is to avoid Sears service like the Black Plague. A whole month!! \n\nSear Home Services\n(800) 4my-home. ... BLOCK THIS NUMBER\nThis is a nightmare...Sears should be ashamed. :("
1,"The food was horrible! the salad bar is not fresh at all! My chicken was sad and dry. It was my first time trying this place.  It smelled funny and my booth seat was torn. The server was really nice other than that it was a waste of money.  They advertise freshly made lemonade and when i asked our server if they had it she said it was just regular lemonade from the fountain drink, I pointed at the \""freshly made\"" on the menu and she said, yes but its just minute made from our drinks. No wonder it was lonely in there!!"
1,"I love Whataburger! But this location, which I visit at least once if not twice a day, has become the very slowest ever possible Whataburger in town! It is been that way for several months. And they don't seem to have a clue that they need to fix it."
1,Very bad service.  The waiter was in rush n was a bit rude.  the food was also bad. The backlava was the worst ever. Would never ever go back again
1,"I tried to go here for the second time today.  I say tried because I sat at the bar for about 7 mins with 3 people walking around behind it and no one even acknowledging I was there.  I ended up going next door to The Map Room for lunch.\n\nThe first time I had gone I had a server come and take my order, a kitchen guy ran it out, and then no one ever came back for 45 mins.  I went to the counter for my check and thought that I wouldn't give it another go.  Well, you can't say I didn't try.\n\n I had the barbeque chicken pizza the first time and it wasn't bad, but its not a place I'd make my go to pizza place."
1,"I was supposed to have a lesson at Dance Charisma. I went in to find that they suddenly closed their doors. They suggested I go to ballroom addiction who they turned all their students over to. I thought I would be better off trying somewhere else considering the situation and went to Fred Astaire dance studio. At Fred Astaire they treated me wonderfully, I've been taking lessons there ever since then."
1,Bad food and even worse service. Do not waste your time or money. I ordered the Cuban sandwich and it tasted like it just came from the microwave.
1,I am a horrible picky eater which is my fault! I use to go in all the time to eat there chicken pesto sandwich.  It was my birthday and my friends asked where I wanted to go and I picked there so I can have my favorite sandwich. It was very disappointing to find out they no longer made it! On my birthday :( so sad we had to leave.
1,"BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE, PRETTY MUCH NO CUSTOMER SERVICE \nI am so tired overpaying and dealing with this company. From messed up bills, service outages to customer service people who just do not care (yes, even hand up). \nReady to cancel right after the World Cup!"
1,"I cannot say that I will ever stay here again..the room was remodeled so it was decent but the help was rude, the food was bad, and the location sucked. The only good thing was the adventuredome for the kids but it was so crowded that you could not enjoy it. The place smells badly and there are rude people everywhere..this place should be imploded"
1,"What happened to you Gaati!?! Every time we ordered from you it is usually  a hit. A few times it was not consistent. This time is the last straw... We ordered delivery of $50 of the chicken pad Thai, broccoli with fried pork, tofu paw see wheewwwwww and mango sticky rice. With a side order of the vinegar green chili. \n\nOnce we got our order to the door, both noodle dishes lacked favor. We barely even see the meat/tofu. And they said the side order of chili was rotten so they didn't put that in. It's one of the best part to put in the noodles if you want a tangy hot kick to the dish. And to top it off... the mango dessert looks like they give us half of a rotten mango WITHOUT the coconut sauce. WTF. This order was not worth over $50 for shitty food. \n\nYou guys lost a customer."
1,"I just wrote a review of the Decatur location but it showed up on the Outlook location downtown which is now closed. Bottom line is that my family has been going there since 2000 and lately their quality and selection has gone down hill with the prices going up ($26.95 for weekend dinner). No Salmon in hot food but they had Tilapia which is the cheapest fish to buy. Sushi selection also disapointing. No Salmon Skin, broiled Eel and overall selection disapointing. The crab legs were very small and only had cold even though they had warm butter. After being a customer for 14 years, we won't be back. There are too many other choices in Lss Vegas."
1,"I visited this store on a Saturday at 5:00 PM.  If you are like me and have about 45 extra minutes to waste, this may just be the GameStop for you.  With only one partially functioning employee, you are bound to have all your needs met in a timely no nonsense manner. Checking out was a breeze, time flew by listening to the employee call every store in the Northern Hemisphere while making small talk with the 78 customers snaked around the cramped store.  But it doesn't end there folks, your patience level will escalate to new heights when you are forced to listen to 5 minutes of worthless sales blabber, before you finally are presented with a six foot receipt. If you have no desire to get home, relax and play your game, this is definitely the store for you."
1,"I am always looking to try new Mexican food restaurants and knew this plaza which is anchored by the Fry's grocery store I go to had a Mexican joint.  So I had the taste for some Mexican food today and found Mi Familia Mexican Food on my Yelp app.  It only had two reviews one by a noob and the the second by someone with over a 100 reviews which had more clout in my book.  So I head over and could not find a parking space in front and drove by to find a space across the lot and it appeared to be under construction.  I thought it was weird since the reviews were from a month prior.  I walk to the door and find a lien letter stating it was closed.  What a let down, I was having a tantrum in my mind.  I took a pic of the letter and posted it.  I walked over a few doors to another restaurant and wasn't sold by the appearance and Yelp reviews.  I left and ate something different altogether.\n\nThis space in this plaza has held several Mexican Food places which none have survived.  I hope the next spot luck!"
1,"Negative stars! I checked in and because a friend was with me to unload my luggage they charged me extra and demanded their ID. The first room they gave me was filthy and the doors nor windows locked with plywood floors. The second room had filthy carpets, broken down furniture, roaches, windows without locks, wet sheets covered by urine scented comforter, molded shower curtain, filthy towels and no hot water. I let the water run for 5 minutes to wash my hands and no hot water. I was told that there weren't refunds. I wouldn't recommend this establishment to anyone."
1,there is  a freakin nail in their bread. i also heard that they had so much complaint in their food quality. never eat in this place ever!!!! especially the one in meadows mall.
1,"This was my second visit attempting to use a $25.00 Restaurant.com certificate.  The first visit I realized that with plate prices between 9.50 and 12.50 that between two of us, we couldn't possibly meet the minimum purchase of $50.00.  My second attempt to use the $25.00 off was tonight with 3 friends.  We started off with an appetizer of Chicken Satay with peanut sauce and a cucumber salad.  YUM.  For entrees, Pad Thai, Pad Se Ew, Pad Wu Sen, and Squash Curry.  Very good, all of it.  The noodles on the Pad Se Ew were overdone, but OK.  The problem came with the billing.  The $25 off Restaurant.com certificate clearly stated that it was not valid on Saturdays.  Well, it was Friday night.  Our server said that the certificate was no good on weekends.  I clearly stated, showed her the highlighted exclusion for Saturdays, that it was Friday night, and that the exclusion is not for weekend nights...just Saturday.  She understood, and asked her co-worker to explain to us that the coupon isn't good on weekends.  I again said, it is Friday.  It's no good on Saturday.  She left, talked to a cook who hollered at her and nobody came back to talk to us and re-explain why the certificate was no good.  We left the full balance of the bill, plus generous tip, but will not go back.  It was very frustrating."
1,"We decided to try this buffet again, we were in vegas last year and wasn't impressed with this establishment for the main reason: FOOD IS ALWAYS COLD!!!! For goodness sake, turn up the heat underneath where the food sits and no need to make a mound of food, the dilis was piled  mountain high but tasted stale and cold. I will guarantee you from getting your plate of food to sitting down, your food will be cold. Food is bland, it's seems like they are more concerned with the quantity of food they put out instead of the quality. I won't go there again."
1,"Much like the other Mexico City locations the food here is pretty good. Unfortunately due to the terrible lunch time service I don't think I'll be returning. My party of 7 arrived at 11:45, before the lunch rush hit. We ended up not getting our food till after 12:45. When the food was finally delivered several orders were wrong (asked for just sour cream, given everything but sour cream, ordered two tacos, given and charged for the 3 taco meal, etc.) After sending one of the items back to be corrected we asked for our checks, and asked if they could be separated. We were told that they wont do separate checks for groups over six because \""it takes too long.\"" Finally after being there for an hour twenty (only have an hour for lunch) we were able to get out of the door. Though the food was good, due to the service and long wait I will not be returning."
1,Fail.\n\nWhere to start.  How about how our waitress didn't show up to our table for about 20 minutes.  Much of the awfulness of this place does have to do with possibly the worst person who has ever called herself a waitress.  I'm not sure how many tables she was responsible for but the wait at the door would have been at least 20 minutes less if she was even remotely competant.  The food was below average and cold and not cheap.  Denny's quality with gourmet prices...no thank you.  \nWith as much velvet and neon in this place the waitress should do a strip tease or something before I get my eggs.
1,Do not go to Red Rock...staff there gave my room away and refused to get me another room when I arrived late after telling them I would arrive late.  I paid for two nights and they took my $ (with Groupon getaway).  Then they would not give my money back or give me a room for the 2nd night after I arrived and told them I was arriving on 2nd night.  Red Rock and Groupon are unethical businesses.  Go to another hotel and Do Not use Groupon Getaway deals...buyer beware....jack in San Diego.  E
1,"The buffet is not even worth the 8.99 price.  There were maybe 6-7 dishes total to choose from and you probably wouldn't want 3 of them.  Scarce desserts, sad, sad salad bar.  Perhaps if they had a 2 for 1 local special it may have been worth it. I felt really bad for the servers. Not sure what the Kali style ribs were, perhaps they were the ribs of a cat!!"
1,"I do NOT recommend one nevada! Theyre not open on saturdays, dont have 24 hour call service. And if you pay something with your card and overdraft even by like a penny then deposit money right after at the atm they still charge for an overdraft fee. any other bank does not do that!! I had gone in to talk to someone about that and all they told me was we're not like other banks and thats our policy. They can take that policy and.....  I think that that is just RIDICULOUS!! I closed my account with them because of that and went to Bank of America!!"
1,"What can i say about this place... STAY AT YOUR OWN RISK!\n\nStayed there for SEMA show 11/6/14 - 11/8/14 and with in hours of checking in, our stuff was stolen from our room.  DOOR CAN BE SHIMMED OPENED WITH CARD!!  It is suppose to be a non smoking room resort so all that stay there smoke in the halls, stairs and everywhere...\n\nOh let me say something about the security staff, sr security unprofessional,  jr security interrogated us like we were the ones that stole our own stuff. Wtf...  NO SECURITY CAMERAS NEAR ROOMS, SO THIEVES HAVE A GREAT TIME.\n\nI also think they have some shady long term residents there, that probably stole our stuff, but we can't prove.\n\nAs for our situation we asked to be moved rooms which they gave us (wrost room than what we had), they would not listen to us when we asked them if they could actually give us a little bit off the room or comp us in any way.  Nobody knew who is in charge and the front office staff was unprofessional.\n\nWe actually decided to leave our baggage in our car as we cannot trust having our valuables left in the room.\n\nIF YOU LIKE GETTING YOUR STUFF STOLEN AND NO HELP FROM STAFF COME AND STAY HERE.  GOOD LUCK."
1,"The four of us found the menu and service too confusing to stay.  Our Quebecois friends took us next door for something easy breezy.  \n\nBesides, we wanted a larger degree of freedom and choice on our last night in the city.  We just didn't want pasta or pizza."
1,"Well, folks, based on the review by Teri C, we thought we would go over and try it.\n\nAlas, they are closed for good.  We are not locals but were just passing through so i don't know if this was a victim of the recession or what.  But, I do know it is closed and abandoned,\n\nWhat a shame, it is a beautiful building.\n\nJim"
1,"Understaffed is never a good thing for a restaurant. Empty dirty tables and a 20 minute wait. So we asked to sit in the bar area while we waited. No service. No bartender to even get a beer while u wait! Still, starving we went to the take out side of the place and we had a generous portion of mediocre typical Mexican food. Bland flavors and no salsas on the salsa bar. Staff that showed up to work today seemed nice."
1,"Maybe it was a bad day.  There must have been a hundred employees running around the store, but there was only one cashier on full service, a cashier who had plainly just been trained.  She should have had a manager bagging for her to help out ; instead she had to keep calling for help.  As a result, even though she was already in the process of checking out the customer before me when I got in line, it took about fifteen minutes before I walked out with my thirteen items.  Fortunately the ones she undercharged me for more or less made up for the ones on which I was overcharged.\n\nThere certainly is a lot of stuff here.  Other people I know say the to-go counters are pretty good.  Lots of frills, like a dietitian and clubhouse and pharmacy.  The selection of actual groceries is average, below average for produce.   \n\nPrices:  not as good as Woodman's or Trader Joe's\nProduce:  not as good in quality as Willy Street Co-op, Jenifer Street Market, or Trader Joe's\nVeggie options:  a limited selection in the health food department, with prices on the steep side\nTo-go counters:  looked fresh and pretty good, but I didn't see anything vegetarian there so I passed on them\nBakery:  looked okay, but the items I wanted came only in plastic multi-packs, so I passed on this too"
1,"June 6 20.14 resort  fee alone is $2 0 per night non negotiable, tax on that too.  A $20 room costs 40. \n\n Lots of hookers and pimps\n\n, non English staff throughout .  Always full of Asian tourists which is ok, But frustrating to the non English staff so by the time they come in ask you when you what you want to drink or eat there already was really angry\n\n the thing I noticed is now they want families in there so men in women with children can come and Gamble and spend their money while a 10 year old watches 3 5 year olds upstairs next to you in your room.  Try not to get a connecting room.\n\nFree wifi, that's new.\n\nSMOKEY!  Bring oxygen. \n\nSlots and Video Poker that drink ladies do not come around at all you'll waste 50 in a video poker machine and still not get a drink\nand of course when they do come around they act like they're doing you a favor"
1,"When is this stupid \""Fresh Mex\"" craze going to end?  How many more dime-a-dozen Americanized (read: bland) Mexican places do we really need?  Over a decade ago it was Baja Fresh... That was cool, nice fresh change from Filiberto's, and all the other wonderful greasy Mexican places.  Then a few years ago we got Chipotle.  And it was fun for awhile, but eventually you get sick of eating the same rice-saturated burrito over and over and over again.  Now we also have Qdoba, Costa Vida, Cafe Rio, and a few other places.\n\nI wish I could avoid eating at all these places for the rest of my life, but alas, sometimes I find myself there, choking down this tedious slop, because all my friends like this kind of food, and I like to be sociable (on rare occasions).  Or, as in the situation that brought me to Cafe Rio, it's where the family is having dinner.\n\nAnyways, I had their \""special\"" pork barbecoa (or whatever they call it), and it was pedestrian, at best.  It did not taste natural; sorry, guys, but pork is not supposed to be sweet.  It's supposed to be nice and smoky.  It's supposed to taste like meat.\n\nThis place is the epitome of the worst aspects of disposable American culture.  No heart, no soul, and large portions.  It doesn't matter what it tastes like, as long as it fills your stomach, right?  Cafe Rio is possibly the worst offender; I think I would rather eat at Qdoba or Costa Vida."
1,"I love my apartment....however, when your lease comes due they try and increase your rent by several hundred a month.  It would be cheaper to move into the same apartment in the complex..makes no sense!!  Also, management doesn't care.  There are several safety hazards, noise concerns, etc.  They wont do anything about it.  Not a nice place to live!!"
1,"I called IKEA to find out if they have wheelchairs available for older shoppers.  I spent almost 5 minutes pushing phone prompts in order to get to customer service.  Once I finally got there, I was on hold for 12 minutes when I gave up and hung up the phone.  It's the little things like this that efficiency, cost savings experts that propose such cost cutting measures to replace people with phone prompts, and staff at the minimum possible in order to force people to shop online,  that makes my blood boil.  They have no clue what customer service means."
1,"45 minutes and nothing more than bread, water and drinks that we bought from the bar before being seated. Somehow our ticket was lost. About 25 minutes in, the manager came over to retake our order. Not much of an apology was given, offered to comp one of the dishes after we inquired. The server was awful. In the 45 minutes we were there, she stopped by twice to check in, only after another server overheard us complaining about the service. \n\nSo much for having a hearty meal before an evening of boozing. We ordered pizza instead from another place. \n\nThe manager couldn't give us an ETA on our food so after 45 minutes, we left.\n\nGood bread, horrible service."
1,"I paid $100.00 for a room with two double beds. The room was not clean. I found debris under the wall heater, discarded clothing tags in the drawers. The worst was the black mildew on the plastic shower curtain.  \nOne light was not working and there was no kleenex in the bathroom wall receptacle upon our arrival.  On my road trip returning home I had spent nights at Holiday Inn express and Best Western and all of those hotels were clean as one would expect. Based on this experience I will never spend another night at the La Quinta chain even though I am sure that not all of their inns are kept in such a poor condition. The unit was truly overpriced for the condition it was in.  The Coffee was awful. There was no choice of bread other than white bread. The staff scurried to remove any and all items from the countertops at 9:30 sharp although guest had arrived only fifteen minutes before and had not the time to finish their breakfast meal."
1,Not surprised they closed. They never had any other customers when I was in the salon. The up front staff was not cordial or inviting.  The services were so-so and not what you would expect in an upscale salon.
1,This place sucks. Way over priced on everything. Any wine or stiff drinks can be found at Albertsons  just up the street way cheaper. The sandwiches have nothing on  capriotti's a few miles away. At best House of Vino is a 7-11 with out the gas.
1,"My boyfriend and I have been here a few times in the last 6 months and I don't know why we keep going back.   The food always tastes fairly good, however their service is horrible.   Our waitress, whom we've unluckily had the last 2 times we were there, is awful.  This recent time, my boyfriends specifically asked for no tomatoes on his burger, guess what it came with tomatoes.  Not a huge deal but would have been nice if it had been correct.   She never asked me once if I wanted another drink, but kept my boyfriends drinks refilled.   We finished our meal and sat there while she kept walking by us, clearly seeing I needed a to go box and never once asked. Finally I caught her and asked her for one.    I wish I could remember her name, blonde, hair in a ponytail all the time, young and clearly waitressing isn't her thing, otherwise she would have paid more attention to our needs.  If I had been paying she would have gotten zero for a tip, she didn't deserve one at all.   Then we went to go pay and leave, however stood and waited, and waited, and waited to even be waited on so we could go.  The cashier/waitress asked my boyfriend how his food was, but didn't ask me.   I think the place needs some work on their people and service skills.    Time to find a new location and give them a try.  We probably wont go back to this one anytime soon."
1,"I wish I could give zero stars!!  DO NOT RENT A CAR FROM AVIS Charlotte Airport!  I had to leave NC early and wanted to find out if it was cheaper to change my flight or drive back to NJ. Based on the information I got, I decided to drive thinking it would cost about 425.00. Expensive but cheaper than changing the flights.  I not only got the wrong information but ended up having to pay over 900 dollars for the car rental!!! I could have bought a used car and drove home!  It's been over 6 weeks and no one has contacted me. I made phone calls, wrote letters etc. I got  information from the main office but they said I had to deal with the same place I rented the car.  I will NEVER rent from Avis and will write a negative review for my corporation's travel website."
1,"We'd been looking forward to trying Growlers, especially the Reuben in the Observer sandwich contest. We went at lunch time and had terrible service!! The place was full , but not packed. We were never offered menus and were ignored even though we were sitting at the bar. I guess if you're not in the cycling crowd or a regular, they don't want you in there. After 30 minutes we left.... Hungry!!!"
1,The place looked great but after we sat down it was downhill from there!! \n\nI ordered the chicken tacos they were so spicy I could not even enjoy them beans and rice were plain so all I ate was one taco. \n\nMy fiance ordered the chicken salad the chicken was over seasoned and he only ate maybe half. \n\nOur friends ordered the burgers and they actually said they tasted great and I wish I ordered that but who knew burgers at a Mexican restaurant would be their highlight! \n\nTo top it off the service was so slow and it took about 35 minutes for the food to arrive I will never return to this place.........................................
1,"Ok based on the two reviews before me you should have good since not to go here.  If I could give it 0 stars I would have but yelp doesn't give you that option yet.\n\nI proceeded to go here for an advertised \""Jamie Foxx after party\"".  So as we showed up early to the ballroom I noticed they're lots of ghettoites in line holding shopping bags and tall plastic drink glasses from Treasure Island.  I mean the scene was just terrible.  There were girls and guys showing up with flip flops on and ashy ashy ass feet like they have been kicking flour or something.\n\nSo we leave and go to McDonald's for a quick bite to eat which is a whole different story, but as soon as we walk back to the ballroom a gang of custom cars were rolling thru more \""middle aged\"" ghetto people were showing up with flyers in there hands like ti was a public party.  \n\nI immediately call one of my boys that works for Jamie Foxx to confirm if they are really having a party here.  Well I was informed that it wasn't a real party and that they Jamie was just making an appearance and collecting $50,000 check.\n\nWith that information I was off to P.Diddy's party."
1,"This place aggravates me!  The location is good, the food is good... and that's about all I can think of that's good about it.  It has such potential though!\n\nFirstly, who wants to be forced to valet when trying to have a quick lunch?  \n\nThe MAIN complaint is the service!  I sat at the bar to have a drink and an appetizer while I was waiting for my haircut.  I had 45 minutes, so I thought that was plenty of time... it wasn't.  There is one blonde \""hot\"" bartendress who is obviously not hired for her skills.  It took me 10 minutes to get my menu and water and then another 15 of trying my hardest to get her attention to put in my order.  The food came quickly and it was delicious... but this girl spent half of the time talking to two guys at the end of the bar and the other half on her cell texting.  By the end I was standing with cash in my hand to try to get to my haircut on time.  \n\nThey also short-change you.  My bill was $10.27 and I gave them a $20.  She gave me $9 back... I feel cheated because she kept my $.73 as a tip... she didn't deserve that at all.\n\nPS.  This is not my first time, I've given this place many chances and fortunately there are some places close by finally where I can take my money and tip elsewhere!"
1,"Another see & be seen place that concentrates more on the decor than the food.\n\nPlease, they have rolls with, names like \""the lawyer\"" & \""lips\""\nMost of the items are so dressed up with mayo, pineapple and other ingriendents, is this a salad or sushi?\n\nI went with 4 coworkers and we all ordered the Omakase (chefs choice)\n\nThe sashimi and and rolls were warm. The rice was so warm it must have just came out of the cooker.\n\nThe fish did not taste overly fresh and the rolls were quite bland.\n\nNot worth the money or time, much better sushi can be found in Montreal.\n\nWished the pretty decor and good service extended to the food!\n\nShodan, no please Sho- me- the- door so I can leave quickly!"
1,"Their business sense and customer service the worst, bar none.  Tried to cancel by phone, nope, must come in.  Go in person, sorry the person who does the cancelations is not in now.  As someone who needs to cancel because I business travel too much and haven't the time now doesn't have the time to cancel.  So I tell the guy at the desk my situation and he agrees they make it hard so you can't cancel your membership.  I tell him I will have to stop my credit card from putting through monthly charges (I have a month to month membership) and he says \""Yeah thats the best way sometimes).  So now months later I am getting harassing calls and they sent my account to a collection agency.  Wish I could do more than write a bad review because the way they do business is down right unethical and maddening."
1,"Stayed on 12/13/12 and the first room they put us in had the AC unit missing, leaving a 2x3ft hole in the wall to the outside. The next room they put us in had visible crumbs left on the side table and the hair on the toilet seat. It has a feel of a hotel that has seen better days."
1,"Stay away - you can thank me later. Most likely the worst food and service I've had in a long time.\n\nPoor Customer Service:\n-Who would think we need silverware to eat our food? We had to ask for this after we got our food\n-No syrup for the waffles\n-We had no refills on our drinks\n-The waitress went missing for large amounts of time and I had to checkout at the front desk\n-She had ZERO personality. \n-The manager never took care of our issues. We got disconnected in our conversation and never called me back or answered the phone when I contacted him back. I see where the poor customer service trickles down.\n-How dare I ask to use my points off my Fortune players card. They gave some excuse that there system can't handle the transaction (this is how they don't allow you to use the points from the casino).\n\nPoor Food:\n-Steak is the worst steak I have ever had. Looked like someone stepped on it and cooked it on the grill. It was full of fat. I did not eat it and would not even feed it to my dogs. Steak was not cooked at the level I stated to the waitress. \n-Waffles tasted horrible and they appeared to use pancake mix for the waffles, from the taste.\n\n\n\nWe felt ill and sick the rest of the day. Eat and dine at your own risk. If your a non-smoker this a heavy smoke filled place at night time."
1,"Sam, \n\nYou were rude on the phone when I called to place my to go order. I knew immediately when I spoke to you at the counter that you had been the one with whom I placed my order. You basically dropped my order on the counter in front of me. I could tell you weren't going to exert the energy to say one more thing to me - the customer. I said thank you, to which you mustered up a thanks. You obviously think you're very cool and important - with your black hair, plastered on makeup, and diamond finger tattoo (how original on that one). You're not important, Sam. And if Pita Jungle has any idea what they're doing, they'll fire you. You're terrible at providing customer service, which is probably one of the easiest professions out there. I've done it. Never did I act as if I was better than the customers I was serving. You should try and get over yourself, for your own sake. \n\nUnhappy Customer"
1,"Came here to watch the end of an NBA game because there are plenty of TVs and ordered the chicken wing lollipops. The wings were poorly done. They were dry, the breading was thick, and there was barely any sauce coating the wings. I will not be back to try other items on the menu."
1,"Almost missed my plane because \""5-7 minutes\"" was more like 15-20, and the line was too long to get a refund for an $11 pizza. Avoid at all costs."
1,If you are 12 years old you will probably love this place but as an adult you should probably avoid this place. The 12 year olds doing the face plant at the pools and in the lobby would normally turn every one off but when the cocktail waitresses bring you a drink and try and fool you - what I don't know what I drink??? This place is lame and any serious person who comes to Vegas as I do should avoid this place like the plague  - Steve Wynn still doesn't lie to people and provides a greats service. Cosmo SUCKS!
1,Not impressed. The service was slow and they never asked for drink-refills. The waitress seemed to be MIA most of the night. \n\nI was excited to hear that they serve GLUTEN FREE soy sauce but you have to watch how they prepare it. They poured normal soy sauce all over my meal and I had to have them recook mine. We had a large group of ppl (15) and we agreed we won't be returning. \n\nOn a positive note.....the sushi was awesome!
1,"What kind of place is this?\nOrder chili on a burger and when you get it, the chili looks like it was SLAPPED!! on the burger like someone back there didn't like you, a sight that makes you lose your appetite.\nPaper thin hamburger patties and in my case the tomato was the highlight of the burger. Tomato slice about 1/2 inch thick, the burger pattie? about 1/16th of a inch thin.\nSaving grace, the fries are good if you eat it there. Take it to go and they wilt and get soggy. There is a better Tommys about 250 miles away in California. This place is a disgrace."
1,Don't waste your time or money.  My salad had a rotten tomato and a hair (not mine).  My waitress never offered another hairless salad even if I had wanted one.  The broiled flounder wasn't very hot and neither were my steamed veggies.  Both were SO BLAND I could have prepared a better version at home.  My mom had spaghetti with meat sauce and said it was just mediocre.  The owner asked how our meal was when I paid and insisted they use fresh tomatoes.  I'm sure they do but I had to spit mine out.  She discounted our drinks but I'll never be back!
1,"RUN! RUN AWAY... I was to this center and at truly a horrible experience. For starters at the Pharmacy the lady that that is very hard to under stand due to her language barrier problem needs to work on her people skills. She became very verbally aggressive and agitated toward me when i was picking up my prescription. She also appeared to be incompetent in performing her job duties. I presented a certificate from my DR. explaining that the client pays only $15.00 & the instructions on how to use it was written in clear ENGLISH on the back. She mentioned \""this saying coupon is expired\"". That is impossible cause there is no date printed anywhere on the certificate. She would not release the prescription after they have filled it. Now she is demanded \""you pay 268.00\"" Who in their right mind talks to a customer like that and expect them to remain a customer of theirs -- Hm Not me. The are very un professional, Lucy & Ethel could have done a better job going in there with no formal training. Lastly I wouldn't even recommend this pharmacy to my worst enemy."
1,They offer a happy hour from 5pm to 6:45pm but when we arrived at 5:15pm they were booked until 9pm even though no one was in the restaurant. I'll post a photo of the empty restaurant. Take your wallet where they care about your business.
1,"All I wanted was a meat pie... Get your minds out of the gutter. Looking for a good British beer and some good eats. Sadly neither was had on this occasion. Tried to find a seat at the bar but it was full. No worries. Outside seating it is. Quite a large patio, nice seating but sadly next to the tracks. No biggie though. And then we waited... and waited... and waited. Finally we gave up. No water. No server. Though there was a friendly gentleman that was closing up the patio that said \""thank you, have a good night\"". Not sure what he was thanking me for though. So no meat and no beer but yet no more appetite for the Brits."
1,Fix your online hours so I don't drive out of my way to your employees turning the open sign off early. Thanks.
1,"On 12/30/2014 I went to grab a bite at the Cantina at around 4 pm. Imagine my surprise when I saw that it was happy hour! Since it was happy hour, I decided to go with the flautas since they would only be $5. They were decent, but I don't care if they were phenomenal...when I went to pay, the rude girl Stephanie at the cash register refused to honor the happy hour price. Stephanie is a dick, as are several of the other workers there that I've had the displeasure of coming into contact with, and they all deserve to have their stank asses fired."
1,"We once stay here some years ago,so I heard about the renovations and booked for one night 09/18/11 construction was still going on,new restaurants, coffee and bake shop,also there was a subway all near check in. The staff were o.k.they all looked stress and very busy but friendly room was large with a super KING size bed(it was just me in this KING size bed all I needed now was at least five more people and I would have been saying party over here) maybe next time but not at The Plaza Hotel,back to the room new furniture chairs,sofa,desk,tables,lamps,wall carpeting flat screen t.v.even the wi fi works in the room's bathroom very small! new sink also there is a safe on the wall.There was no soap at the sink or the tub,only sheets on the bed no top cover with three large pillow's only thing that I can see that was not new in the room was the same old beat up brown door's last thing there is no Ice machines on any floor's checked two floors up from the 9th and two floors down no Ice...took the Ice bucket back to the room before going to the front desk they tell me you get the Ice from the casino's OK. no problem I get there and asked for some Ice the guy behind the bar says where your Ice bucket I just walked away...saying to myself that was the last $56.49 they ever get from me."

1,"Hadn't had any cavities in a long time... All of a sudden had 10??? Since 7 were on one side but multiple surfaces of teeth equal the 7 (not 7 teeth), decided to do one side at a time. Had horrible sensitivity and pain. Decided to go elsewhere for 2nd opinion. Gave them my last digital X-rays and they took new ones. Said NO cavities... So where are those last 3 that were on the other side???? Beware! Never going back there. Ask their front office staff how long they've been there... They keep getting new people, wonder why."
1,"Awful, awful, awful service...  Enjoy the Salt river on your own..  Do not depend on the dim wits that work at the rental place. They have no idea what they're doing, and the \""supervisor\"" (that looks like an overweight backstreet boy reject) had no business talking to other humans.."
1,"Avoid at all costs unless you enjoy standing in line watching 4 people try to figure out how a burrito is made.  Slowest location I've ever seen, even when there's no line.  Never going back."
1,Very bad customer services!!!!!!!! They do not  know how to do gel manicure!!!! It looks so thick and all bubbles ..... Horrible customer services.... I am very disappointed ..... Those people don't know how to run business ... I will never recommend  it   ....very low class......
1,"The food was ok, not great. I mistakenly assumed that for $36 The goblet was included, and that was my fault. Although we were able to purchase it for an additonal $14, we politely declined.  We came here expecting to pay Vegas prices. The $2 water charge was one thing, but when I ordered two chocolate milks for my six and three year old daughters and saw the bill for $6.49 EACH!  That's not even Vegas prices, that's just CRAZY!  I will never go back to this place again."
1,"If I could give it a negative rating I would. The only good thing I have to say was it was cheap and you get what you pay for, be forewarned. \n\nSo I went with the soup and salad combo. Got the Lobster Bisque, I was excited because I love Lobster Bisque, this is NOT Lobster Bisque, it should be called creamy vegetable soup, no seafood flavor and not a hint of Lobster. I really thought that Bon Chef Cafe had the worst Lobster Bisque I ever had, but Cafe Zupas topped them. I suggest the owners go try Ventano's Lobster Bisque, so they know what real Lobster Bisque tastes like.\n\nThe salad I picked was Chopped chicken salad. If there was an ounce of meat in this I would be surprised, also got it with Blue Cheese dressing, again if there was an ounce of dressing on it I would be surprised, flavorless salad and vegetable soup is not what I ordered, but it is what I received.  \n\nFinally with this fabulous meal, we received Bread and what they call Chocolate dipped Strawberries. The bread is like a thick slice of Wonder Bread. The Chocolate dipped strawberries are dipped on one side, but once you try it you are glad they didn't cover the whole strawberry in that cheap waxy chocolate."
1,"My GF and I went there and the music was good.  However, we are in AZ and thought Nachos would be a safe bet.  I tried to order them with chicken (a 1.50 up charge and the bartender advised they already come with meat and beans)  I went without the chicken.  We have been around the world, currently living in the pix area, and these by far are the worst nachos we have ever had.  More than half the stale chips had nothing on them.  Beer was fine, music was good, but I would never eat there again.  $12.00 for the nachos?  If I was the owner or cook I would be embarr assed"
1,"sandwiches are OK,  just OK. mass delusional hype is the only explanation. sides were not worth it at all. skip waiting in line like a tool and just order the sandwich to go if you want the \""experience\"", what experience that is I have yet to figure out"
1,"The service is terrible. There are not enough bartenders nor wait staff!   Was there a change in ownership/management, it sure shows!"
1,"Went for lunch again for a meeting. Had the \""gnocchi\"". Fucking disgusting. Same sweet, pasty garbage they put on the spinach wrap I'd had there previously. Also, gnocchi generally aren't rock hard, football shaped pucks of paste. Shit."
1,"Waited over an hour for a pill consult, even though I had an appointment.  WTF is the point making appointments if I'm still gonna be there all day?!"
1,"Recently went to this location at 6pm on a Saturday.  They were out of rare and medium rare prime rib when we ordered.  Since this is what we came for, we paid for our drinks and left.  The manager said they had \""run out\""  I told the manager we were dissatisfied that a major steakhouse plan so poorly,  He said he was following Outback policy and gave the impression that we should not expect rare or medium rare prime rib at 6pm.   I went next door to Longhorn Steak house and had a very fine rare prime rib.  I will not be going back to this Outback!"
1,Quite a frustrating experience. I ordered three different lattes and it took 30 minutes for the young man to make two. There was another young girl there standing around seeming absolutely clueless. The whole shop was full of frustrated customers I finally asked them to refund the third coffee so I could get out of there. Even though I work just down the block I will find another coffee house to go to. Thankfully there are other choices of coffee houses in the area so I will not have to go through this frustration again.
1,"There is a man that walks around supervising and his presence is stern.  He also seems to rush the women that are working even when they are clearly doing a great job.  The atmosphere is tense and the ladies working in the store do not seem as friendly and happy.  This place is not relaxing.  It is overpriced too.   I took my friend and paid $99 for two pedicures and a manicure.  The services were suppose to be deluxe, but they were in fact average.  My thumb nail was not evenly coated and my boyfriend wanted me to go back and have it redone but I did not want the girl that  completed my manicure to get in trouble for a re-do!  That manager was scary.   This is not a business I would support."
1,"Went in there this morning. The lady spent barely 10 minutes on my hair...it was a disaster. I asked for a low faded and she shaved the whole side of my head with a 1. I don't care if it was a 13 haircut, I ended spending another 23 bucks getting it fixed at the barbershop/salon on the other side of the shopping center. (I should've went there first, but didn't know about it). But if you want a real haircut...don't go here. Paid $13 for an embarrassing haircut."
1,Zero stars! Filthy dirty.  Took way too long to get the food.  The hostess was rude and the server was bothered. The lady cleaning the tables was so obnoxiously loud.  Hope someone else has a better experience!
1,"The staff here is awful!  I went to the Chateau for a big celebration night expecting a night of dancing and fun, but the staff's pretentious attitude was shocking.  If it was just one employee, I could excuse it, but every staff member was equally rude.  Needless to say, we left and found our fun elsewhere!"
1,"The service is inexperienced still.  They don't know there menu.  We were party of 6, 3 of us has same dish so we got ours together.  We had to wait 5 minutes for the others to get theirs.  Awkward as don't know if we should eat or wait.  They call out dishes as if I was at McDonald to claim my order.  They should know who had order what.  It's not that busy.  Had linguine with clams, didn't offer plate to hold shells so had to put shells on  table. When asked about their wine menu, said don't know and had wine menu in hand.  If u don't know then pass the menu to us to see!  We can read."
1,"Awful!! They would do better to just serve beer and nothing else. Overpriced and tasteless food. If you have to watch your diet for health reasons forget it, there is nothing here for you, on the other hand if you want to speed up your heart attack this is the place go.\nIf you go there thinking you will just have a beer and enjoy a nice ambiance than think again, the seating and whole building design is akin to a school cafeteria, to make your unhealthy, expensive, experience just that little bit more uncomfortable."
1,"Dirty, how hard is it to clean up the litter outside and vacuum into the corners of carpeting? Several things were broken in room, had to request another, no tub just a shower with out enough shelf space, internet problems, I  will not return."
1,Did not mind the hr wait when they said 30. I'm used to that but when I sat down and saw old food on my fork I was disgusted. Not to mention I don't eat red meat or pork and the waitress would substitute my bacon for anything.  I understand that it's a restaurant and things like dirty silverware happen. However the fact that the hostess snatched my fork and didn't apologize for the dirty silverware kinda pissed me off.  I decided to complain to the manager. He did everything in his power to try nd turn my experience around but I was completely turned off. I would not recommend or ever go back because of this experience
1,Least business friendly post office in the city & general customer service is horrible.  Avoid if you can.  No drop off for pre-paid packages.  Long lines.  Just bad.
1,No stars if allowed! Worst experience ever...for the past 2.5 yrs. Customer service is awful....wait times are always 30min or more after scheduled appt time. As you sit in the waiting room you hear them calling people to cancel next day appts...'not enough chairs we overbooked'. They can cancel less than 24hrs but patients cannot without being penalized. No consistency. I once received a random bill and when calling to check on it I was told 'in the summer we have orthodontists filling in from other offices. This fill in we had does not take your insurance. We- bright now dental do take it...but he does not'. Appt days/times suck and clearly revolve around the orthos busy personal life. I have given this place so many chances...so many deep breaths before walking in the door and they still fail. Lots of chaos & people arguing with staff. One ortho says ' braces off in 2 weeks make that early morning appt!' You get there and its a different ortho who says ' who told you that? I'm sorry...you have a few months left'. This inconsistency has happened 3 times now. Which resulted in 3 times needing time off work. I'm all about customer service and this place is a 3 ring circus. Biggest scam I ever got contracted into. :(
1,"Every time I come here I think it's going to be up to par with everything else Bellagio has to offer.  But, it fails every time.  The food is not tasty.  Plate after plate I threw away.  Hoping for something better next trip to the buffet.  It made me feel responsible for world hunger.  It made me want to have a word with the chefs about how to season.  It made me wish I was at the buffet at Wynn."
1,Zero stars!!! To begin with you know customer service is the most important thing in a resort and this resort has no customer service!!! Second it is a waist of time to book a reservation because they don't give you what they promise! Third my swimming pool at home is bigger than the one they have here!! This resort treats their visitors like crap and end up ruining your vacation to Vegas!! The price is not worth the bad treatment!! Alot of people recomend this place cause they have no self worth and are blind to reality!!!!!!!!! Don't waist your time with this place they will only ruin your Vacation!! They lie and say that you can use the swimming pool at the cosmopolitan resort.  It is a lie.  The place smells and to get to the parking area is hard to find.  No valet service and parking lot is far away from the entrance.
1,"The decor is pretty cool but the food was... utterly REVOLTING!!! My friend who went with me actually couldn't stomach it cuz it tasted so terrible. Please for your own good, avoid this place at all costs. Even if you're starving...."
1,"My boyfriend and I found a travelzoo deal for this place for $55 a night. It looked nice and promised to be a relaxing getaway. Unfortunately, we were very disappointed. The entire place seemed deserted. We stayed in the luna towers and I felt like we may have been the only people in the entire building. The pool was closed, most of the businesses in the \""village\"" were closed or shut down. There were a total of 3 restaurants to choose from. The pool in our building was closed so we had to use the other one further away. The \""Shuttle\"" to the strip consists of a van that can't hold more than 6 people so you better make your reservations DAYS in advance. \n\nLooked like this place had great promise, but we will most likely never go back again. We paid over $60 in resort fees and I'm not sure what this even covers as it was hardly a \""resort.\"" Super disappointed. NOT TO MENTION -THE CASINO WAS CLOSED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No one mentioned this to us upon booking. :("
1,"This place is god awful. Just search the Google reviews, they are all true. Here is a small sampling of what I experienced with this horrible shop.\n\nThis place is small and dirty. Major stains all over the rugs. The bikes are all chained together so you're not to touch them we were told by the owner. He was very rude, asked us if we were going to buy or not because he was busy in the back. This is after just a few minutes and we didn't ask for any help... just wanted to look at his limited quantity of what turned out to be over priced bikes... I wouldn't trust buying a bike from here. It's a shady shady place.\n\nstay away at all cost."
1,"I will keep going to Roberto's! Chipotle is soo cheap with their meat! I ordered a burrito they put soo much rice and beans in it, and one scoop of meat inside. Then I asked is that all the meat she literally scooped 4 more peices of steak and kept on going. On top of that when I took a bite of steak it was really fatty and chewy. Never eating here again!"
1,Sat March 12\n\nHotel - City Center Arias. Wow nice hotel.\nHaze - Not our crowd.\nTaos - Too crowd because of a famous DJ in town.\nXs - 3 people(2 guys 1 girl) - Paid 20pp to get to front of the line.            1.5  hour wait if you want to stand in line\n3 =80 cover\n3 =42 for drinks. Waited for an hour to buy 3 drinks.\nThat was kinda stupid.\n\nNow for the bad.\nAt the bar outside(not at the pool-under the cabana. Bartender was piss off at something. Start bitching about being only 1 person with 2 hands. Start yelling at customers to shut the fuck up. I guess when someone ask what her problem was. She call the security and had him thrown out.\nNice. \n\nXS is cool if you get bottle service. \nHave been there twice before and got bottle services and had a great time.\nMaybe the reason why she is still bartender there because they want you to get bottle services. I would not go there unless I get bottle services.\n\nAlso it was hella cold outside.
1,"Very average/ below average food and experience.  Would try some place else if you have the chance.... Had the sicilian pizza and was not overly impressed- it was a bit doughy (no flavor) and the sauce was \""institutional\"" tasting.  Would only recommend in a pinch... if nothing else was open.  Staff was very nice!"
1,"Fees for \""dormant\"" account stripped me of $20 over the course of a year and a half. Be warned. And be warned that tellers have no interest in helping. The gentleman there in the back office was nice and informative and that is about where the good service ends."
1,"Normally I wouldn't care to post a review for this place but I would like to warn you ...\n\nDon't go here .... This is the thing ... I believes it was a \"" Thai restaurant \"" or at least so kind of  real Thai joint ... I came in and the look of the good was good .... They show the dishes prepared on a glass counter .. Then you get to choose how many options you want ... So you make your picks .... And then ... The worst ... THEY MICROWAVE IT .... Wtf ??? It's all cold ... Being there since good knows when .... And you know how does microwaved  food tastes ... So basically you are paying 13 cad for a dish  of microwaved \""Thai \"" food ...do yourself a favor, buy frozen food and go home , you won't see nothing exceptional here \n\nOh and btw .. First time they microwaved it .. It was only hot on the top .. So imagine general tao Chiken cold ... I asked to put it again on the microwave ...Oh my god !!! I left 3 minutes ago after realizing that bond of The 3 dishes was even eatable .... \n\nPLEASE DONT EAT HERE UNLESS YOU FEEL LIKE  WASTING 13 cad / PERSON AND IMMEDIATELY GOING SOMEWHERE ELSE TO HAVE LUNCH OR DINNER"
1,"Went with another couple to get caught up over Christmas time.  Horrible service right from the start.  Had to ask for everything.  Loud obnoxious group there at the same time so forget being able to hear your own table if there's a crowd.  Took forever for our food to come.  Forever for the check, which was NOT worth the price. First and last experience there.  Too bad cause we're locals who love Mexican food."
1,Horrible food!! Crab legs had a funny smell and weren't fresh. Definitely not worth $15.99. If you know what great food tastes like do not waist your money here: (
1,"My husband and I visited this buffet as part of the \""Buffet of Buffets\"" tour in Vegas. This was the most terrible buffet I have ever been to in my entire life. \n\nSelections were limited and the food was not very fresh. I couldn't identify the contents of one of the fruit cups being served and asked the server what it was. She didn't know either! Neither did the other server she asked!\n\nI would have been sooo angry if i had paid for this buffet out of pocket and walked into what I did. Even if we were to return to Vegas and do the BOB tour, I would skip this dump.\n\nHonestly I was a little surprised how bad Lago buffet really was given that it is part of Cesar's resort. I've always envisioned Cesars as being a world class place. Boy did Lago chance my mind about that! The management really needs to clue in and fix this problem-child. It left a very bad taste in my mouth. \n\nAVOID this buffet! You will have better luck at Harrah's or the Rio!"
1,"The managers of both the Italian and Asian counters are extremely rude and pushy, I think their names are Tom and Jamie.  You would also think such a huge store they would have a decent selection.  Way over priced too.  I would recommend going elsewhere, a place where managers actually care for your business."
1,I came here for my birthday and it was not the best way to celebrate. The best part of the meal was the drinks which still did not make up for the hair that was threaded through the soft pretzel I had eaten... Service was pretty slow and nobody acknowledged the hair. One of my dining companions also discovered that their napkin was used. The burgers were okay but nothing to write home about since Vegas has a LOT of great places to find a specialty burger. Would probably not come back here.
1,I Cant believe how poorly they did with my hair when i have at least two friends in cosmetology school who didnt mess up as much as they did. The cut did not look together and just messy and thin and the peekaboo's were no where near even. :|\nI would not drive out there for anything unless i got a coupon or something but i would not use it for a cut or color.  I would love to see how good they do compared to my friends beauty schools deep hair conditioning treatment because i have tried it at an ulta salon and it did not last  a week. \n\nThe girls were nice and did a good job massaging my scalp during the shampoo stage but that is about it.
1,Getting seated wasn't difficult but after that the experience fell apart. We ordered  cocktails and water. The cocktails came in a timely manner but we only received one water. My husband ordered the shrimp and grits and I ordered the grilled scallops with butternut squash. The temperature of both dishes was cool. Almost room temperature. My husbands shrimp and grits were colder than my squash. The service was not professional. Being rushed to get the credit card out after receiving the bill.
1,"No help at all, they were just sitting in there office and didn't even greet us. They had no idea what was on there lot when I was asking about prices.. Came out here from Mesa and it was a waste of my time. Horrible customer service!!"
1,It is all you can eat because you can't any of it.  Cold food and no labels on items.  Several people took one look and left.  They were the smart people.
1,"I'm new to Pittsburgh and I was looking for a place to cut my bangs because I don't need a full haircut yet. I spoke with a nasty gentleman on the phone and he proceeded to tell me I shouldn't expect a free bang trim, when all I did was ask him the price. \n\nLet me make that perfectly clear, all I did was ask the price. \n\nHe thought I sounded upset by the price, but I wasn't and didn't appreciate his tone. \n\nHe then hung up on me. I called back to tell him I wouldn't go there after his treatment of me over the phone and he YELLED at me on the phone telling me I was rude for asking for a free haircut. Which I certainly did not and I don't understand why he thought he should repeat that multiple times to me, I was more than happy to pay and go back there once I needed a full haircut. \n\nVery snobby and rude, if you're having a bad day don't take it out on customers. Its' extremely unprofessional and I'll make sure people know about his treatment of me."
1,Management has no clue what they are doing. Always mess up the orders and management hides in the back. Food could be ok but it never comes out right. They wont be open much longer as boombozz was way better and went out of business.
1,"Visa gift card, free night stay, discount!?Wondering if that's what the management is handing out for good reviews. The area is odd to say the least. A lot of transients walking through the open parking lot 0.o at all hours.\n\nRoom is clean but it has an awful stench and it's supposed to be smoke free. It doesn't smell like smoke it smells like mold or mildew. I tried spraying the room with body spray thinking it was temporary but that's not the case. \n\nThe entrance is just one way! How inconvenient on such a busy street, lets hope you're not in hurry to get out or come back to your smelly room. \n\nI'm to stay another night but that's NOT going to happen. Book at your own risk!"
1,What is one to do when the change/cancel fee is more expensive then what my tickets cost?  I guess US Air will have a few no shows on flights this week.  Thanks for being so accomodating in such extenuating circumstances with Super Storm Sandy!  NOT!
1,"Very dissapointed with this place... We reserved there banquet room for a baby shower. Contract was signed & banquet room paid for, we sent out our invitations. A week before baby shower they call to notify us that they had double booked there banquet room. They caused alot of  trouble & stress for us. Turns out this not the first time they do this."
1,WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! Took my cat to get groomed with Mandy. She told me because there was a small knot in my cats hair that she would have to lion shave  my cars entire body! Obviously I said no and took my cat to petsmart where they brushed out the knots and returned my cat with a gorgeous coat... DON'T EVER TAKE YOUR CAT TO MANDY!
1,"Nothing Great about this location! Don't bother to tell them what kind of cut You want. They will argue with You, & tell you it's the cut you asked for. Terrible customer service! Less than 1 star if that's possible."
1,"Very long wait to times for mediocre food. I know the server was busy, but it took 20 min after we got our beer to order food. I had to flag her down.\nThe mandarin wings were basically deep fried, over cooked, then drenched in sauce. The lime rub wings were bland. Wings out of store bought box are much better.\nBeer was good , but how can you mess that up. Native NY used to be 'the bomb' -now this place simply bombs."
1,"I can't comment on the actual services because we ended up walking out after waiting over an hour for a pedicure that was said to be only a 15 minute wait. In the hour we were there, not one person was finished and four people still sat waiting in the chairs to have a nail tech even come over. \n\nSorry, there are too many other nail places around. We will never come back again."
1,"#1 Scam. When we signed up the lease, Manager Patrice Harrington was very nice and told they will help in sub lease, when we break the lease. But when we broke the lease things completely changed and I have to pay buy out / penalty of $1536 which is 2 months rental amount. When we tried to negotiate, Patrice was very rude, she was treating as if we would run away without paying any money and told \""fail to pay the amount would end up in collection which would badly affect the credit history and we could never enter the country\"" . Don't believe with the false commitments unless you have in writing. \n#2 Apartment is very old they haven't renovated for years. Appliances are old and house has severe leakage, so you will end up paying at least $100 though you are not using a AC/ heater for sure. We reported many times but no proper action was taken.  The back gate is automatic door and its broken for last 3 month and no steps were taken to fix it. So no security.\n#3 Children play ground is pathetic with broken swing and Pets make shit every were, owners are worried to clean that up, so its not safe to allow the kids to play in the grass.\n\nThere are many other good apartments nearby.....but definitely not this on, don't ever think  about it./..."
1,"Pretty, modern, green...but corporate and architects run wild...in all this, they forgot the customer!\n\nVery inconvenient layout...plan on walking a mile+ to do anything!  Difficult to navigate, spread out, and chicken***t delivery.  2 drink coupons on arrival...good for the minimum well drink beer or wine.  No free pours.  The Washingtons are squeezed till they scream in this place.  Stay Away!"
1,"IF you are a wanna be gansta, like rude service and poor quality, over priced food......MAN, You are in for a treat. EVEN the security guards have bad attitudes!"
1,"This place has needed an update for years.  Experienced all the problems and more that I saw on the HI website dating back more than a year.  Apparently complaints get form letter lip service only.\nMain thing is filthy carpeting.  Walked around barefoot in the room and when I stepped into the shower dirty footprints washed down the drain.  Killed a roach.  Hallway has foul smell.\nNo coffee set up in the lobby.\nSaw a so called hotel security guy open someone's room without knocking and peak in.  Ask for his id and he had none.  Took him down to the front desk but they were not  concerned.\nBill was not correct but they fixed it with no problem\nSeveral problems with room key working, also shower (hot and cold reversed, hard to operate)\nSeen better in Nigeria"
1,"I wish there were a negative rating on Yelp. We had been deciding between MOR, Ashley, Costco, and the Room Store for our furniture purchase. We finally decided to buy our furniture from the Room Store because the sales guy swore up and down that theirleather warranty couldn't be beat. Um, yeah - biggest mistake ever. We received our furniture and within a few months the leather started flaking off. Like, literal flakes of black glitter EVERYWHERE. We could live with the flakes, but finally we noticed holes starting to form in several areas. We called customer service and they said they'd be happy to send someone out under the warranty. A week later, someone called us to schedule the repair service but not only did they not show up or call on the date schueduled, customer service at the Room Store told us that because it looked like the damage had occurred more than three days ago, the warranty was now void. I seriously recommend you take your money and your business elsewhere. The craftsmanship is shoddy, the customer service blows, and the warranty is non-existent. They're not even accredited by the Better Business Bureau, and if you do your research online, you'll quickly see that the Room Store rarely honors their warranties. Shame on you Room Store."
1,"The next time I want microwaved hot wings and pizza crust that tastes like a water and flour slurry made love to a bland piece of cardboard, I'll be sure to hit up Otto's. I had to seriously blast those hot wings in the broiler to make them even remotely crispy and even then they were still rubbery. The pizza was so overwhelmingly mediocre we tossed the rest after dinner instead of refrigerating it. \n\nAlso, calling in an order and then showing up 20 minutes later to be greeted with, \""Oh, we didn't start your order because we couldn't call the number you gave us back,\"" when they clearly had caller ID and the number was misheard one off, was new to me. So was sitting there for an additional 20 minutes and watching them microwave a plate of hot wings. Never seen that before either. I don't know how you're still in business, Otto's. Not even collegiate nostalgia will get me to stop there again."
1,Yuck food is greasy service stunk! I ordered a Philly sand which to find out they were out! Ordered French onion soup was way too salty. Mozzarella sticks ok but defiantly greasy! Waited 20 minutes for our check as we were told our server was busy. Needs a good cleaning also
1,"The last time I was here, I almost wanted to cry just from the sheer frustration of trying to find the exit out of this sardine can.\n\nThe decorations I will say is beautiful.  There are beautiful flowers floating on the water, a giant buddha that greets you as you walk in, and girls scattered throughout the club to make it seem more exotic.  But like many Vegas clubs here, it gets SO busy, that you have no option, but to continue to move up the different levels.\n\nAnd move up we did...up and then down, up and then down.  My poor legs and feet thought I was going through a Shaun T insanity workout...wahhh...\n\nThis up and down trek through the stairs was not by choice.  We were actually trying to get out and asked a few security guards the direction to get out.  Each time we were told something different and each time we ended up having to wait in a ridiculous line.  Were we being punked?? It took us a good 1+ hours to get out!  \n\nBased on my last experience at Tao, I vowed never to come back.  The decor is beautiful yes, but I didn't like that my clubbing experience involved me going up and down stairs and being incorrectly directed towards a line that didn't lead to exits for half the time."
1,"I placed an order with swim2000 through Buy.com on 1/03/12 to be shipped in 1 or 2 business days.  The order was shipped 1/09/12 because \""the warehouse was closed for inventory\"" and will not arrive in time for my vacation departure.  \nLOUSY CUSTOMER SERVICE!"
1,"Let's face it, this is fast food.  This Taco Bill/KFC location is one of the worst I've been to.  I go 4 - 5 times per year since it's close to work.  Usually find the place a little dirty and the service slow - at least it's consistent.  I think they stopped putting any type of sauce in their Bean Burritos and the chicken soft tacos are lacking enough filling - meat, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, etc to even come close to filling the shell.  \n\nI've started going to the one near 19th/Deer Valley for a slightly better experience."
1,Downstairs bar is now smoking only - no food. I also caught a rumor that they are re-filling their premium liquor bottles with generic brands.  Like I said - Rumor. \n\nUsed to have great food. Now it has smoking.
1,"Wow! Never had this bad of a service before and this is in Las Vegas! Service was really, really slow... We came here for dinner around 8pm and it wasn't even busy so I don't understand the extremely slow service. The worst part is, the servers didn't even apologize for the bad service and they completely ignored us while we were waiting for our food. Waited an hour and more for our food, and when they came, there wasn't even anything special about them. The worst part?! They charged us for 18% gratuity automatically just because we were a party of 6."
1,"In a 5 star hotel, a better consumer  is expected. these guys think just because they earn money, they can do whatever they want. No more business for them is a good punishment."
1,"I'm a big Starbucks drinker so I was super excited when I found out how close this one was to us! However, to my disappointment this has been the only Starbucks that does not hold up to par. Every time I have gone my drink has been messed up. Even simple drinks such as a hot green tea. So sadly to say we won't be going to this Starbucks any more."
1,Office staff was unorganized (scheduled me with the right doctor but at the wrong location causing me to show up at the wrong location and having to be worked in with a male doctor-not my preference). Follow up calls to speak with a nurse took longer than promised for a phone call back only to be told I needed to come back into the office (totally could have been avoided if she would have just listened to me). Ended up going to another doctor. Will not go back to Eastover. Very disappointed.
1,"Just waited 22 min for service and nothing.. We got set and literally sat there .. Waiting and waiting and waiting .. It wasn't even busy.. Incompetent staff, and terrible service.. From a previous hooters girl, I'm completely disappointed and will never come back. We walked out."
1,"First off, they frisk you for weapons so you know the place is ghetto. Secondly, fat chicks everywhere. Thirdly, bouncers are incredibly rude and power hungry mongers. Fourthly they charge a cover when at midnight on a friday in the middle of summer nobody is even there. Fifthly, parking is $8 dollars. Sixth, there are 3 bars right next door for the same price (cover). Seventh, bathrooms are disgustingly unsanitary. Eighth, there are more cops in the bar than there are patrons. Ninth, there are a lot of creepy old guys, and tenth, again, nothing but fat ugly chicks everywhere.  Overall a terrible experience, will never go back."
1,"I was recommended by a coworker to get my haircut here. My hair was a little bit past my collarbone. I asked for about an inch off with no crazy layers and it HAD to look good straightened. My hair was curled when I left so I thought it looked find. When I went to straighten my hair for the first time this morning I was absolutely horrified by the choppy layers in the back of my head. It looks like I have just 3 blunt layers in a random patch on the back of my head. I have never had a bad haircut before and now I understand why people say it is so traumatizing. Also, the shampooing experience at the salon was sub-par. There was no massaging or head rubbing involved and it was very quick."
1,"You know, I was warned by many, but did not listen!  Ugh!  \n\nThe people that work in this store are so rude.  I went there with a big budget to buy a new mattress and no one would give me the time of day.  I don't know if I looked stupid, crazy, or like a vagabond without any money, but I couldn't get anyone to help me at all.  After about 15 minutes I was able to find someone that didn't run away when I approached them.  I asked him to help me with what I was looking for.  He really wasn't any help and would just point and say try that one.  Everything he pointed me to wasn't what I had told him I wanted in a bed.  It was so frustrating!\n\nAfter about 20 minutes of useless help I left and went to Relax the Back and bought a $4500 bed there because they WOULD help me and didn't treat me like I was dumb and not worth their time.  \n\nBoo R.C. Willey!"
1,"Alright, I admit, this is not my type of crowd or environment and that's part of the reason for the low rating.  Hey, you do it for the Scottsdale bars - so leave me alone!\n\nOur group headed here after Oktoberfest for a few drinks, and after finding a long wait for Rula Bula we ended up here where it was pretty dead.  Inside, there were a bunch of older creeps creeping on the scantily clad bar staff.  Outside, it was cramped and stinky of smoke.  The service at the bar was just okay....not particularly friendly or fast.  \n\nI wouldn't return here because I'm not in college and I'm not an older creep.  If out on Mill, I'll stick to Rula Bula."
1,"Poor customer service\n\nMy friends and I have been looking for a great place to make it our spot. We have been to many places and we found this place, first time I got into it with a nail tech after politely telling them four times how I wanted the design and also showing her a photo. \nSecond time was nice and they do a nice job so I made an appointment for me and two of my friends at five pm. My friends arrived before me and were told that we didnt have an appointment,  my friend called me and told me,  I told her who I spoke with and my friend again told the nail tech we had an appointment.  The tech said \"" like I told you, you'll have to wait,  we didn't write it down\"". Needless to say after now two issues we did not wait and we will not go back!  \nThey do great nails if you can handle the attitude"
1,Way overpriced and not very good quality. Improve the quality and lower the price and i'll be back.....the food is tasty tho so at least i'll give them that. I've had everything from here and i can honestly say it doesn't compare to a real bbq place. This is oven cooked stuff.
1,"I went to this place in extreme pain.  Dr. Nash took x-rays and told me that my spine was severely crooked and that I was in Phase 2 degeneration.  She told me that I needed THIRTY treatments or I might be looking at surgery.  I told her that I had been told that I had 6 lumbar veterbrae and she looked at the xray and counted \""1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  Nope you have 5 like you're supposed to\""  She refused to treat me that day unless I committed to the 30 treatments, and sent me home in pain.  Well, I don't respond well to scare tactics, so I ran far and fast from this place.\n\nI found a wonderful doctor in Las Vegas.  He took x-rays and the first thing he said was \""Have you ever been told you have a 6th lumbar disk?  It's called a transitional disk\""  I liked him right away.  He also said that my spine looked really good and that I had hardly any degeneration.  I told him that Dr. Nash said I had Phase 2 and he said, \""not even close!\""\n\nI guess people buy into her crap because she's in business, but I found someone who had me back at work and feeling great in TWO treatments!"
1,"As explained to us after the fact, this management team does not see itself as responsible for disruptions caused by other guests!  (We're talking overflowing tubs on higher floors here!)\n\nThe accommodations are fairly nice which is why we booked them for a second year in a row. BUT! A guest in the room above our daughters' (ages 19, 14 and 12) room let the tub run all night and flooded portions of both our rooms below. Of course, none of this was noticed UNTIL WE AWOKE IN THE MORNING WITH SOMEWHERE TO BE IN ONE HOUR, so we--all 5 of us--made do with sharing the lesser of the two damaged bathrooms, confident that management would adjust our bill and do the right thing once the manager could be reached. \n\nWe were wrong! After much work and argument on the phone by my wonderfully  diplomatic husband, we have been granted a $20.00 consideration.  $20.00?!  They will say that because they offered us another room that morning, that *that* should suffice. We, however, were not in a position--logistically or time-wise--to accept their offer so I guess it's our burden to bear? So wrong. Just so wrong.\n\nI will be telling everyone I can in my hometown of Mesa to find different accommodations when their loved ones visit. Stay where management has some integrity!"
1,"Horrible horrible horrible. I came here based on a recommendation from my friend for my shattered iPhone 5 screen. Unfortunately, this wasn't the first time one of my iPhones had been shattered and recently, it happened again. The LCD screen was completely dismounted from the phone making my phone have stripes on the screen. \n\nI brought it to another lady, the gadget fairy, who repaired it for me and afterward told me that the person that previously repaired the phone (one stop wireless) had removed very vital components which was causing the stripes. Additionally, she said that the only reason why I was getting the stripes was because of the missing parts and that I was lucky to have been careful because the phone should have given stripes much sooner. \n\nI will NEVER return to one stop wireless and will never recommend anyone to come here...the folks over here are pure thieves and should not be in business."
1,"I will never visit this establishment again--due to the owner's xenophobic remarks about how caucasian women raise their children, and I am married to a hispanic! Don't think that your ugly attitude and remarks were not in earshot of your reprimanding the waitress--and all over two lousy bucks add on for tortillas! Sick. Her dropping the Fbomb and shouting at a waitress for not removing a cap of Perrier before bringing to the table was also loud and clear. I would never want my Perrier uncapped before it arrives to my table."
1,I use to eat here at least once a week for the last 5 years because I loved it. We\nAlways had great service and everything was wonderful. My family would even celebrate our birthdays here and take up the whole big room but it's so sad now that they are losing a wide variety of their customers because you now have to be 21 to enter. If your over 21 I do recommend you try this place before it turns into a PT's.. We all know that that's going to be once they change it!!
1,"They got the worst service ever. I have no idea what's going on with the lady there. She seems like she hates everyone and all the customers need to appreciate her service. \nI will never ever go there, I prefer to walk all the way to UPS or Fedex. \nI seriously do not understand how can people like her still work there."
1,"Pizza was disgusting; not fresh and reminded me of Red Barron. \nMy order took exactly 1hr 47min to arrive; and was cold. When I called to complain; I was provided a $2 discount. The girl was rude; and acted as if it happens all the time; so it was simply no big deal. My order from this place was a mistake to begin with; as I thought I had ordered from my FAVORITE place, Sicilis. BIG MISTAKE!!! If you want GOOD and Authentic pizza; ORDER FROM SICILIS on Twain. Stay far, far away from this place."
1,"I had the oddest experience with this club.  I had a VIP pass that I got for free from the lounge outside.  I got in the club easy, bypassing the mammoth line on a holiday weekend.  I went into this loud, packed, hot, weird room.  I stumbled, excused, pushed, balanced, and squeezed my way to the far end where the bar was.  I looked for a seat but there were none to be had.  I tried to get a drink at the bar but everyone seemed too busy to serve me.  I stood there for a while checking out the people in the place.  I got thrown out by Security who said they got a report I was engaged in inappropriate activity.  I was like huh?  You are kidding right?  Sorry sir, you have to go.  And escorted out into the night sky!   Whoa!  Like a Keanu moment.  Weirdest thing ever.  Won't waste my time again though, count on that."
1,"I have no business whatsoever being at a race track.  I know nothing about horse racing.  I was obligated to come for my friends birthday though otherwise I would never come here.  This place is dirty, out dated, and the crowd is dirty and dingy.  Never again!"
1,"Horrible! What a dump, wen there just for our kids and checked out thee next day! Was put into a dirty room with laundry bags, had to be moved and therefore cause us to miss the only real dinner for the night, the arcade is run down, none of the machines work and the ones that do u have to wait for attendants to pay u out"
1,Was on time.  Seemed knowledgeable.  Gave some good ideas for what I wanted done.  Called back later in the week since I still hadn't even received a bid.  They said they would get back to me.  Never heard from them again.  I really don't like people wasting my time.  They could've at least called and said they couldn't/wouldn't do the job.
1,"If I could give 0 stars, I would. Booked via Orbitz, so there was no option to pay for bags, which meant paying $50 for a CARRY-ON. Won't be using them again, ever, and will advise all my industry friends to avoid them, too."
1,"I have lived in phoenix all my life and seeing as mexican food is one of the main dishes here it goes without saying that i have tried numerous places both good and bad. This unfortunately was a bad one, the flour tortillas and salsa were the best thing of the 2 dishes I tried. The beans though they were creamy and smooth seriously lacked flavor of any kind the rice was also just as bland as disappointing. The chips they serve when you first sit down are ok, but they only serve 1 basket free where 99% of other places will serve you as many as want. this isn't a huge deal but it adds to the experience. All in all it was not the worst mexican food ever it just didnt meet the standard that has been set by the south phoneix classics which are Carolina's, Poncho's, and Rito's."
1,Run away as fast as you can. Took a laptop in to have the power jack replaced. By the time they were done almost 2 weeks later my laptop will not turn on and they took no responsibility for it. They attempted to blame the problem on the computer having a problem before they received it even though they had turned it on and examined the computer when I dropped it off. I was handed my non working computer and told there would be no charge. They appear to do a great job replacing iphone screens but replacing a power jack on a laptop is out of their league. Think again before you spend a dime with these guys. There is a reason they are not registered with the Better Business Bureau.
1,"Lousy burger, loud atmosphere and overall lame experience. You'd think if burgers was the ONLY thing on your menu you'd do it right. and I was not a fan of wearing a hospital gown to lunch it was neither fun nor funny. but I suppose if you're really in the mood to eat and watch someone get spanked then this is a good place?"
1,"Severely overpriced. 42.00 for 3 cocktails. Service for lunch was slow. French dip had no flavor and French onion soup was just \""ok\"". Great view of the strip."
1,"I have purchased two bikes here.  The products are great but the service isn't.  The bike mechanics are generally not very knowledgeable, and the head  mechanic never actually listens to what you have to say.\n\nI had my bike serviced under warranty.  I was promised a turnaround time of 3 to 4 weeks but instead had to wait 3 months.  When I received the bike back it was delivered with flat tires, and improperly adjusted brakes and gears making it un-ride-able.  Under further inspection there were various bolts and washers missing, and the crank spindle was installed without grease when it should have been.\n\nFurther I was assured by the store's owner that everything that it went in for was fixed, however only a portion of the tings were fixed."
1,"I hate this stupid buffet. I end up here when I stay at Aria for one reason, pure laziness. I usually eat here right after checking and I am \""already here\"" or right before I check out, and I figure it's quick and better than fast food on the road. Each time I have eaten here (at least three times now) it has been for the weekend brunch. I have disliked it each time.\n\nThey never have fresh mimosas. I never know where they come from, but no bottles of champagne in sight.\n\nThe food has been cold, and left around between the morning rush and the lunch rush, so keep that in mind if you come at an odd time. Hopefully, you don't come here at all."
1,"Extremely slow service at 715 a.m. on a Saturday after Christmas?  15-20 minutes after ordering the food came to us. 2 breakfasts off eggs, bacon and waffles with one coffee and one OJ cost us 27 dollars and change. I left 30 dollars total only because I wanted to leave and didn't have exact change for my bill, otherwise I wouldn't of tipped."
1,"If you want all the pleasures of a mediocre olive garden meal at 4x the price, this is your place. I've never been so bumbed with a meal. Waiter was great, and meatballs were good. Penne and vodka was tasteless. calamari was terrible. This place wouldent last 2 minutes anywhere near NJ."
1,"Don't plan anything else for the day if you have an appointment here...they don't seem to care about anything else you have to do for the day.  I waited for a half hour after my appt time and I finally had to leave, that didn't seem to bother anyone there."
1,"I weep for humanity.\n\nWords like \""horrifying,\"" \""embarrassing,\"" and \""tragic\"" should be used when describing this culinary disaster.  Our group of four had to hunt to find anything edible just to get past the meal.  \n\nWe could taste the cheapness in the food.  It was like the dishes were assembled  in another country, frozen, shipped, accidentally thawed, re-frozen and then reheated for the Luxor's unsuspecting dining victims.  \n\nThe Luxor should be ashamed and management should be forced to eat here daily."
1,"XMAS PARTY RUINED BY GRAND LUX!! You would think that making reservations one month in advance would secure our request for our office party. NO,NO,NO not the case at the Grand Lux.  The day before our party, our reservations-- our reserved table, per our request, was given to another party.  They told us our reservation was for 10:30am not 6pm(their admitted mistake) wait...they said..we don't open until 11am!!?? WTF??  After speaking to the manager he did offer us some cookies for our trouble. Gee..thanks but no thanks. Oh and they did offer to put us  on some high top tables..too bad two people in our party are in wheelchairs...that is why we requested the booths. Very UPSETTING and DISAPPOINTED in the Grand Lux!!!  Apparently you must call each day to make sure your reservations are secure.  DONT PLAN ANY PARTIES AT THE GRAND LUX"
1,"As of 7/23/08 this location is closed.  It is being turned into a new business, a Korean fusion style restaurant.  According to the new owner, the business shut down about 6 months ago."
1,"Can i give zero stars?  This was, by far, the worst breakfast we have gotten in Charlotte. The sign says fresh new breakfast, not even close.  Pls look at the pic of one of the \""sandwiches\"" I posted.  Awful.  Styrofoam eggs, forgot the cheese on all sandwiches, and half a scoop of eggs an one sausage patty split in half for a hoagie roll. For 4+ dollars.  \nWhy would anyone in their right mind go to this place, I was fooled once, pls don't repeat my mistake."
1,"Beware of this place!  I went a few years ago and found a black hair in my salad (I am blond) and was disgusted! They replaced the salad and still charged me for it.  Fast forward three years and my Mother-in-Law found a cockroach in her taco salad.  My husband's family has been going to this restaurant for quite a while.  Not anymore!! The waitress asked if she wanted to take a new salad to go (she lost her appetite but give in at the waitress insisting).  She got it to go and was charged.  The owner was a complete jerk and argued that the bug could have flown in.. On top of that, the food is mediocre."
1,Stay away from the dairy during this time...my two sons had yogurt (chocolate and strawberry) and a friend of ours had whipped cream on her crepes tonight.  All three had to run for the bathroom soon after.  Something is spoiling the dairy tonight.  My other son only had a cup of non-dairy toppings and my wife had strawberry crepes with powdered sugar...they are both fine.  My boys were able to flush it out and are fine now but our friend is still in bed..probably for the rest of the night.  What a way to end her last night of her trip.
1,"The great dilemma, is this resort & casino worth 1 or 2 stars?  I love the location of this hotel and had a room with a view of the bellagio fountains.  Despite those promising facts, I changed hotels after 2 nights.  The casino did nothing for me, nor the mock french streets and restaurants.  I am in my mid 30s and was also on the younger end of those I saw roaming this resort.\n\nThe room was kind of blah.....had a nice big bathroom but the normal living area was pretty small.  It is evident that this is an older hotel and casino.   But the main reason for the rating of 1 star.....I have to agree with the other reviewer that commented on the air quality.  Ever time I walked into this resort, I feel like somebody kicked me in the stomach.  The stench of the air was disgusting.  If you look at the painted ceiling in the casino, you might see pollution.  If they were to give air quality ratings to casinos similar to cities, they should tell you to wear a mask and drag and air tank with you into this joint.\n\nAnd the debate ends with 1 star.  It wasn't a complete disaster but I did end up changing hotels and would not stay here in the future."
1,"I'm a long-time lurker, first-time writer.\n\nWe went to Black Dog last night at 8:00pm after hearing rave reviews on two local blogs (you probably can guess which ones.)\n\nWell, we stood by the door for a good 5 to 7 minutes politely waiting with absolutely no one giving us a blink of attention. We saw people in booths and tables with food and drinks, waited on by a woman, and at least two people standing around behind the bar. They were not busy.\n\nFinally tiring of this exercise we seated ourselves at the bar uninvited. The bartender came by and told us they were basically out of food. No ribs, no pulled pork, no chicken, nothing.\n\nI can understand their under-estimating demand given that they haven't been open that long. (Although, if you start serving ribs at 5pm, you only have something like 5 booths and 4 tables, and you're out by 8pm -- huh?)\n\nBut if someone had told us there were out when we came in, it wouldn't be a problem. Letting customers just stand around stupidly is ridiculous. I'm sorry, no food is so good to suffer so much attitude. I felt like I was in a snooty restaurant in Paris.\n\nNo thanks. We went down the street to Seven Saints and had a nice dinner with friendly service."
1,"They billed insurance incorrectly for my visit and refuse to resubmit the claim using the correct billing code. They keep invoicing me directly insisting I pay them directly despite Aetna telling me I am not responsible for paying the bill. I even played them a recording of Aetna telling me not to pay them, but they refuse to contact Aetna to try to resolve it...they'd rather me pay cash out of pocket. Avoid at all costs, horribly unhelpful staff that refuse to do their jobs and instead prefer to make the consumer pay for services that are within their insurance coverage."
1,"This place has been around since I was born and critics seem to love this place. I am a big fan of Lolo's so this place should be even better right? I brought two of my foodie friends and we were excited about trying this place. Our high expectations were shattered with the worst service I've ever had and just downright lame food. The \""world famous fried chicken\"" (which took 20 minutes to bring) tasted like Banquet frozen chicken. The server brought our cornbread 10 minutes after our lousy chicken. We had no silverware for a while.  My other colleague ordered the special ribs. He compared them to the McRib sandwich which I thought was an insult to Mickey D's. The men's bathroom didn't have hand towels to add to our misery. The coup de gras was we paid $16 for a crappy chicken plate and an iced tea. \nEverybody has a bad day but if you've been around for 48 years, you have no excuses."
1,"Rude and unprofessional staff. I had my cart dissembled and received no apologies. I would expect much better customer service in Whole Foods since the store has higher prices compared to other groceries. However, I have never experienced such cart thievery by staff in other grocery stores, even after leaving cart alone for a while.\n\nI left my cart and went to the deli where I waited for deli lady to tell me ingredients and price of the pizza dough; it took her much longer than I expected. When I returned to place where I left my cart, there was none. I asked pink-haired bakery lady if she's seen it, but she didn't. When she asked cashiers, little Asian guy admitted that he dissembled it and returned my meat and cheese to the departments. No apologies. Bakery lady didn't say anything either. Wow, what a great customer service!\n\nI had to go back to the meat department and ask for my meat, explaining the situation. Meat guy said that it was probably done, so food wouldn't be stolen. Now I was accused of potential stealing. How the food sitting on the cart can be stolen?! On top of that, they sold my ground beef package, so I had to wait for new ground beef to be grounded and then packaged for me for 20 minutes. Again, no apologies were given."
1,"WOW. Went there for the first time Friday. Thought it was good until today when my friend sees they added 20$ onto his tab. Tipped the tender each time a drink was purchased. He has all the receipts and it was way less than what they charged him. So if you enjoy being robbed, this is the place for you! NEVER returning."
1,Amazing!  I called and scheduled an appointment for an estimate to design our backyard.  The guy called at 10 minutes to the appointment time and rescheduled for an hour later...no big deal it happens.   When he showed up he had a piece a paper and pen and no tape measure!  How in the world is he going to give us an estimate without measurements!  What a Fail!
1,"Very unprofessional, from scheduling appointments to referrals to billing...billing is a disaster, no matter what, you will be referred to collection then you call them to see what it is about and Mary Jane promises you that she will fix the problem but then the collection agency writes you again then you call Mary Jane to see what is happening, she apologies and then blames it on the other inexperienced coworkers...Enjoy the loop lol"
1,"The last four times I came in there were zero hand baskets.  Well gosh darn it they moved them.  How about a sign telling me where they are when I walk in.  Perhaps, the sign above the hand baskets telling me they moved would be better suited in the spot where the baskets were previously.   But, what the bajeezus do I know?!  Today, I went to the new hand basket spot and they were all gone.  Not a single darn tooting basket.  I guess I will buy a basket and balance it on my head like an Indian woman.  Maybe if I bring in the receipt for mt new basket Safeway will reimburse me!  Maybe they will also give me an additional .25 off my purchase everytime I use my basket.  Like those granola bags the hippies use.  Walking home with my purchase tonite my plastic bag broke.  If I had my basket this poopy thing would never happen."
1,"I used to like the Carne Asada, then one day I got a Toe nail in my burito. So Gross I want to puke thinking about it.. I quit going for several months, and went back our of desperation late at night. This time got a carne Asada again and this time with the time of someones fingernail, So gross.. NEver again. If you like mystery meat then you would like this place. GROSS"
1,"Maybe this was an off day for Los Favoritos... but whatever the case I won't be giving it a second chance. Because of all the raving reviews for their breakfast burritos we decided to try them. I have never had a burrito more gross than the one I ate this morning. Stale tortilla, greasy potatoes, bland flavor. Everything was bland; the salsa, guacamole, beans. We were both so disappointed. It was like eating a flavorless brick.  The customer service was subpar as well. The lady at the front counter was rude to us and wouldn't even offer a smile or greeting. \n\nAgain, maybe this was an off day but I was sorely disappointed. I want a burrito with flavor, freshness and excellent salsa. Phoenix, help me out- where does this exist??"
1,"Never go to a place like his for shots. They try to sneak in an extra $60 fee for an \""exam\"", plus you still get to pay for the shot after that. You can get the same shots from Maricopa County for $20. Call 602.506.7387 for more information.\n\nhttp://www.maricopa.gov/pets/vaccinations.aspx"
1,"Could I tell you anything about the fitness experience at YouFit?  I would if I could, but my friend and I didn't get that far in the process.\n\nI walked in and the guy at the counter offered to show us around since I explained that I would like to check the gym out.  I swear that this guy was on drugs with the way he was talking and his sudden ADD movements that he was experiencing.  And he had his back turned to us the whole time, so I couldn't even hear a word that he said.\n\nWe asked if we could get a session to try the gym out and said that we would have to pay $10 for a guest pass.  Really???  The Village even offers a 7 day free  pass to make sure I like it before I would sign up. He then said his boss would kill him for saying this, but if we went online, we could get a free pass.  What????\n\nThe fees are ridiculous, and with the way this guy was acting, we definitely didn't feel comfortable giving our information out.  When we were going through the process of payment, the YouFit associate then said, \""Oops, there is another fee. It's for maintenance.\""\n\nMy friend and I looked at one another and left.  This was not the place for us."
1,"One star is too much here.  Went for breakfast at 3:00 pm. Waited forever for food. People upset and leaving.  We were Hungary so stuck it out. When food arrived, instead of hash browns with my eggs, they gave me French fries... Said they were out of hash browns and took it upon themselves to choose for me.  My husbands skillet breakfast was suppose to come with red potatoes... Surprise... He got ash browns because they were out of red potatoes.  He could not eat his... Looked old and mushy.  I cannot believe that they would not come and tell us and offer us to change dishes or select a replacement for ourselves. Upon leaving... The manager cashed us out and when we told her what happened she argued with us and said that they were not out of red potatoes.  Two waitresses off to the side informed her that they were and she copped a wicked attitude and basically told us to leave. She did not charge us for breakfast.  That was the reason for one star."
1,"Every time we go here it gets worse and worse. Dirty, rude employees, and less and less flavor. All three of ours were white snow at the bottom. Worst location! Clean it up and treat people well!"
1,"This used to be one of my favorite places to come, but, not no more! They raised there prices, and the service went down hill. Here is the other thing you have to watch out for, when you put your name down on the list, people will walk in and just sit down at seats that are available. The tall Spanish guy there who sits you down is a jackass and is rude, my wife saved him from being punch in the face. Just a warning to you guys.. Thanks"
1,"From the previously frozen corn on the cob to the mediocre BBQ sauce, this place is the pits. I do like the way they throw all the 1950s furnishings and finishes in there randomly, and our waitress was good, but the food was weak and the people around us were getting horrible service. The table across from us sat there after finishing their meal waiting for the waiter to come back for almost the entire time we were there, and when he asked the host for the tab, he told the guy he should go find his waiter.\n\nFried green tomatoes were OK, but not great. Sauce was actually pretty good; the highlight of our meal.\n\nThe backbone of good BBQ is a good dry rub, and my chicken had none. I'm more of a fan of KC style BBQ, and I don't appreciate when it arrives already slathered in sauce, so I asked for mine dry. That was a mistake, as what came to my table looked like no more than a roasted half chicken. It didn't really taste slow-cooked either, and the meat did not fall apart like it should. Hell, I can cook a beer can chicken in 90 minutes and it falls off the bone. I don't believe they cooked this for half a day as they claimed. Even with any of the three sauces--which couldn't go head to head with Open Pit or KC Masterpiece--left me very disappointed."
1,"Took mom there for Mother's day and it was a mistake. They were not prepared for the crowd they had that day. There were not nearly enough tables and first come first serve, waited in line after line negotiating food orders and drink orders. They told us an hour and it was over 2 hours before the food was ready.  Overall a big disappointment."
1,"I tried - seriously, I tried to come back.  The 35.00$ oil change and car washy was too tempting for me to ignore.  \n\nWhen I arrived at CAS the hipster garage monkey informed me that since I was rocking a newer vehicle and because it drank synthetic oil instead of conventional that there'd be a price difference. Yeah, a 40$ price diff yo.  EEEERRRN - hell no.  It tried but I'z donee mayn."
1,"This is where you go to get wrecked............ by cheese.  If you like cheese A LOT, you can order any of their delicious combos smothered in ooey, gooey, creamy, warm cheese.  \n\nIs there actually any real food underneath the gigantic blobs of cheese?  Strap on a portable oxygen tank and dive in to find out!\n\nIn the 1988 film \""The Blob,\"" an evil life form goes around eating people, only at Laredo's you can finally get yer revenge and eat the blob...............if you dare!  \n\n*blurp *blurp*"
1,"I work at Tivoli Village and have been here on three occassions. I really wanted to like it, but it was simply a poor experience each and every time. The decor is confusing; part soda shop, part modern bistro, part old world italian....did a professional designer get paid for this project? The service was completely disorganized; orders came out wrong over and over. I was offered scotch and wine at 11:30am, while dressed in a suit and tie. I know this is Vegas, but really? The menu reads great, but the actual product was underwhelming. Burgers are petite, nearly flavorless, and bare almost no resemblance to those described on the menu. The Southern Fries (sweet potato) were actually pretty good. The highly touted milkshakes are over-priced and just so so. Bottomline: go to In n Out instead, or if your must overpay for a burger, do so at Lbs at RedRock or Burger Bar at Mandalay Bay."
1,"Crass incongruity at its worst. Or best? Is there a difference?\nThis restaurant features average pizza and a magnificent pipe organ. My parents and I arrived just before the music began, and I was so excited at the prospect of hearing some of my favourite classical pieces.\nOh, I was a fool. \nThe organist played marching band music and doo-wop. It was so loud that my deaf parents shut off their hearing aids.\nThe customers actually interrupted their meals to stand at attention, and then cheered wildly when the organist played \""America the Beautiful\"". My smartass dad asked, \""What song is this?\"" A burly guy with shaved head and shark eyes sitting across from us responded by showing my dad his fist. His entire arm was covered in American flag tattoos. \nAn ideal place for the very young, very old, deaf, or fanatic."
1,"If you want your order to be correct, call another franchise. They do not listen, forget to include the additional items in the delivery, but NEVER forget to charge you for them! We ordered 2 Pizzones, only one came, then the \""manager\"" (I'll use the term loosely) gave us attitude when we called back to complain. She had the Pizzone redelivered, AN HOUR LATER, without so much as an apology!! I hate hate hate this Pizza Hut!"
1,"Disgusting. \n\nThe waiter came by our table often for the sole reason to interrupt our dinner and give us a long-winded speech about clubs and deals and other bullshit that had nothing to do with our dinner, or food. He also knew nothing about the wine, it was like being served by a car salesman who kept forcing us to listen to his sales pitches.\n\nThe food was lukewarm, and so so so dissapointing. The seafood, though it was NOT specified on the menu, was drowning in some sort of butter/cream goo. The steaks were dry, flavorless, and small. Everything was overpriced, and the wine was terrible. The seasonal \""vegetables\"" were cold, and covered in dry parmesean cheese. The potatoes were bland as well. Four of us sat down for dinner, and nobody's food was warm enough, and everybody was disappointed by the low quality of their meal. \n\nSuch a bad experience, and it hurt to pay the very steep bill at the end for such terrible food and service.\n\nRainforest Cafe....never, ever again will we dine with you."
1,"It has recently come to my attention that there is an homage to Lulu's in Fallout 3, which makes sense, as the post-apocalypse is the only setting in which I could imagine myself enjoying their food.  The food ranges from the barely mediocre Chinese to a few perverse interpretations of pan-Asian fare.  (For example, their Pad Thai, which is a soupy, syrupy-sweet, noodley mess.)\n\nThey even somehow manage to spoil the simple pleasure of bubble tea: their tea is heavy, and seems to be creamed with coconut milk (which seems like a good idea until you've had two sips and are full)."
1,"This location is horrible.  The order taking is inconsistent - Gina can never get things correct.  The product quality is inconsistent, and they are frequently out of items"
1,"Came here for a drug screen for a new job. Tried to call for 2 days to set up a time to come in. Time is money. Every time I tried to call the number listed the call would ring and then just disconnect. So due to the fact there is a time expiration on the drug screen. Came in to get it done. Show up, find out there is over an hour wait just to pee in a cup. Ask if there is any way I can just go because this whole procedure is going to take less the a minute to do. Ask to speak to a manager. David. Who is extremely rude and proceeds to tells I can either wait or leave. I explain I have been trying to call the location to set up a time were he basically tells me that there is nothing wrong with the phones he has been talking on them all day. But I have been here over 30 minutes now and have not heard the phone ring once. Overall the place is dirty. The wait is ridiculous especially for a basic drug screen and the staff is extremely rude. I highly suggest never ever coming here. I know I will never be back. Ever."
1,"Pros: The view.  Fancy paper towels in the washroom.  The servers, in general, seem to care and try hard.\n\nCons:  Basically . . . everything else.  The management (especially the general manager, in particular, who seems to fancy himself some sort of bargain-basement Vin Diesel clone. Seriously - the pseudo tough-guy act belongs in the gym, not directed at customers in your restaurant), the menu selections, and a Monday Night Football event that is now so limp and neutered that John Bobbitt should be the spokesperson.\n\nIn a town that offers soooo many excellent choices, there's absolutely no reason to settle for Garfield's Amateur Night.  Save yourself time and frustration and take your business elsewhere."
1,"If you want slow service?this is the place, only two people working on the day before thanksgiving really??? What is wrong with you people? You have people waiting in line for over one hour! Not cool, at all."
1,"First of all, my wife and  I live in Vegas. I work for Clark County. I made a reasonable request. I wanted a non-smoking room. The first 2 reserevationis taccepted my request without question, accept they kept on dropping my calls during the reservation. The third time, a narcisistic reservation agent (She seemed to apologize but turned around and said they never drop calls), quoted policy and procedure and said that she could not guarantee the other request. She gleefully handed me over to her supervisor. He backed her up and offered a refund. I have been going to the Stratosphere with my wife for seven years. This was to be our seventh wedding anniversary there. We were not asking for a bottle of champagne or any special favors. Everyttime we have been there, they had to move us to another room because something was always wrong, smoke filled rooms, toilets broken, broken a/c. Thanks Francisco! You admitted your company doesn't give a crap about it's customers!"
1,"Um... no, and no.\n\nFor $40 you can definitely get a better buffet elsewhere. We got the discounted price of $28.99 and it was still not worth it.\n\nOysters, dried up. Clams and mussels, sandy. Prime rib, tasteless. Sushi, thrown around. Desserts, sad. '\n\nThis is coming from someone who LOVES buffets. I'm happy at Hometown Buffets. So no and no. Never again."
1,"I used to enjoy coming here, but today after I ate a couple pieces of my chicken from my dark meat chicken pho,and I told the waitress the soup was very salty, can I cxl it if it's possible, and she said\""your ordered it and you already eat it, can't cxl it\"" really?????? She didn't even offer me and see if I want to exchange something else, what kind of service is that? Sometimes a good reputation and service is more important than the money !!!"
1,"I'm pissed! We went to Firehouse today and the food and service was find but I came out and my truck was towed because I parked in the only available spot next to Jack in the Box. \nI went back into Firehouse and I asked \""Do people get towed\"" They answered \""oh yes all the time\"" \nThen I asked, \""Why don't you tell your customers to help them avoid getting towed?\"" They said \""well there are signs everywhere.\"" \nDo you really think anyone would risk eating their again after getting towed and they don't even extend the courtesy of warning you about the parking. \nStupid irresponsible business practices. Obviously they don't care about their customers."
1,"Stay away from this rip-off joint. Took my car there because my air conditioning wasn't working. They said I had a line leaking and needed over $800 to fix it, plus I needed a bunch of other stuff totaling $1100. I wanted a second opinion and took it somewhere else where they said there was no line leak only a bad o-ring. Walked out with an $85 tab vs $1100"
1,"Awful customer service!! Went on Memorial Day weekend - what a disaster!  On Sat night the restaurant had to quit taking orders because they were so backed up, there is not ONE working grill (they have like 8), wanted to charge $10 for a breakfast buffet on Sunday but there was NO FOOD!! Trash right by front entrance completely full & overflowing. That is just a few of our complaints. Cannot fathom why ANYONE would come here for an evening or weekend much less rent a slip long term. Go to Scorpion Bay instead!! They have their stuff wired. This harbor is a JOKE."
1,"one star because:\n1. my boyfriend's parents took us to the show.\n2. the costumes, pyrotechnics, and faux-opera-house decor was decent.  not nearly enough bang! for las vegas, however.  and the pyrotechnics blinded me they were so bright.  but maybe i just have sensitive eyes...\n3. a three hour(?) broadway musical was squished down into a 95-minute \""las vegas spectacular\"" so i didn't have to sit through three hours of crap and yawning.  (what exactly was \""spectacular\"" about Phantom?  i'm still not sure).\n\ni really hate musicals and stageshows.  call me \""uncultured\"" but i feel they're all a bit too over-the-top and contrived.  ten minutes into Phantom, my mind was already wandering (ex. \""when is this shit going to end?!\"").\n\nmaybe if i weren't such a musicals-hater, i would have given this show a better rating.  but i am.  so boo.\n\nthe highlight of my evening was my dinner at bouchon."
1,"If I could give 0 star, I would have. This company has the worst boss that I have ever worked with in my 20 years. This is an abusive working environment. The CEO Mr. Morganson is absolutely a psycho. You can hear him curse at the employees every single day!! Don't be surprised if you hear a lot of F words and S words from the CEO in the office! He just doesn't know how to behave in a professional way!! You would feel that you're nothing but a slave, the feeling is so bad that you would feel want to escape from the place all the time!!!!!!"
1,"My rating system (5 is the best)    Food=0  //  Service=0  //  Attitude=-10 //  Crowd=Normal  //  Consistency=No  //  Bathrooms=The best part of the experience //  Overrated=YES\n\nTOP 5 WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCES... \n\nFor a little Buddha the manager had a big napoleon complex. I was a victim of that Waterdog large party massacre. 18 people took taxis from the Wynn... When we arrived the restaurant was 1/2 empty and the manager decided to split up the group. He was a triple threat - a total liar, bad attitude and worse breath. When I told him I would Yelp about our experience - he said don't threaten me.\n\nNo threats here - there are too many good restaurants in Vegas, save your money and your taxi fare..."
1,No stars!!!!! \nBad service! Worse food! Manager has a real bad attitude!!!!!!!!!!\nDon't ever bother to go there!\nIt totally sucked!\nThese people have no idea of how to prepare or serve food!
1,"I got into Madison pretty late due to a delayed flight.  It was getting pretty late and I just wanted something to eat after checking into  my hotel room.  They had an ad in the hotel directory so I ordered from them for delivery.  I know, I know, I should have checked Yelp first.\n1) They were \""out\"" of thin crust.  Umm, yeah weird but ok.   I'm tired and hungry so I'll go for their usual \""pan style\""\n2) They took over an hour to deliver from 3 blocks away\n3) The pizza was truly gross.  I should have just gotten something from a gas station or something.  It was not good pizza."
1,"So disappointing ... Love the Squirrel Hill place, but the service downtown was horribly slow and snotty. The place was half empty to boot. Food was a bit overpriced.. Guess they are shooting for bankers lawyers and foundation types..."
1,"I am going to jump on the \""this bar sucks\"" bandwagon. I am not fond of the bar, the staff or the cliental. My experience was a crowded bar where I had to push myself up against every Tom, Dick and Hairy just to make my way through the crowd. I even got my butt grabbed by some random guy and when I turned around to shoot him a dirty look he said, \"" pass that on to your friend with the nice ass.\"" Thanks- real boost for the self esteem buddy.\n\nAnyways- don't go there unless your desperate."
1,"Worst airline EVER! My boyfriend and I went to Catalina island for my birthday. We were stranded out there due to a huge storm, with no ferry or helicopter service to get us back to the mainland. Called the airlines to let them know we wouldn't be able to make our flight due to the bad weather and they wouldn't waive the change fee. So $400 later to be booked on a flight the next day. This will be the last time we ever fly them, Southwest will be it from this point forward."
1,"Called the day before to find out when they would open on Sunday and if they would have 3lbs of BBQ beef brisket available, or if I had to pre-order.  I was told they would open at 11am and they would have it available tomorrow and I wouldn't need to pre-order for 3 lbs of the beef brisket. \n\nOn Sunday I showed up at 11am only to find they had new store hours posted that they open at 2p. \n\nI called 10 minutes before 2p and a gentleman told me they would in fact be open at 2pm today. I asked if they would have any BBQ beef brisket available when they open.....specifically 3 lbs.  He told me they would. I arrived 20 minutes after they opened, only to be told that they did not have any BBQ beef brisket left. I can't imagine that the beef brisket sold out within the first 20 minutes. It clearly was not that busy. Awful customer service. No apology. I was looking forward to this place, but now I am never coming back. Wasted 2 car trips to get nothing."
1,"Awful experience. Came here for my sister's birthday. Good thing women were free, but damn it would suck to be a guy. My husband ended up paying $125 at the door. First dj was awful & played music that were slow and un-danceable at the beginning. A coke & rum cost a freaking $16 and it wasn't even a tall glass!! Dance floor was too packed and it took me 15 minutes just to leave it. I think several fire codes were violated that night. Main dj (Hardwell) didn't come on until 1:30 pm, at which time it's impossible to even move in the dance floor. Ridiculous prices. Totally not worth it. Hakkasan was a total dud & disappointment. Would not recommend unless you're planning to purchase one of their even more expensive table service."
1,"Lets talk about popcorn.  The worst popcorn is served here.  The amer..Dental Association must give them money to serve this popcorn.  Cinemark popcorn is really good. Only one cashier to sell tickets, 7 people serving food.  The lines were very long on Tuesday.  The theatres are fine."
1,"I don't know why it took me so long to write this review, but this is, by far, THE WORST PLACE IN VEGAS!!! And I'm local, I eat in restaurants in town all the time.  Let's start with the host telling us there would be a table available in 40 minutes. It took an hour. We'll continue with the waiter sitting us in a freezing table next to the back door. We asked to move, he said there's no space available, we moved ourselves and it took them 20 min longer to get us menus. The music was super loud and so very annoying. The food was OK minus and the desserts were really NOT THAT GOOD AT ALL.\nI'm never going back, I have such a bad opinion about this place. I'm getting angry again just from writing this review... Save your time and money and go someplace else!"
1,"Do not go here, ever.  Service was rude and offensive.  Arrived 15 minutes early and we told our table wasnt ready and to have a drink at the bar. Okay, I understand that except for the fact there were 5 or 6 empty tables for 2 within eyesight of the bar.  Twenty minutes later went to the desk and, guess what, they took us to one of those empty tables!  Not only that they brought us to one of the postage sized tables jammed between two others.  When I asked for another open table slightly hammed, and open of course, nope that was reserved by somesomeone else. Give me a break.  End of story walked out, git a huge table at Ten Penny ip the street and had great meal."
1,Yuck...we ordered take out for lunch... $10.00 for a child size portion of dry disgusting lasagna....the lasagna taated store bought & old. It was very vrry dry.  WAY OVER PRICED......as for the 24 inch giant rustic....head down the 101 to the actual Giant Rustic Pizza Joint & get it for abt half the price of yo paulys & much better tasting....Terrible day old food for very high prices..lots of other choices in scottsdale to go to...avoid this one....YUCK..
1,As soon as I sat down you can hear the kitchen staff bickering over the music.  Once my entree arrived (Chicken Larb) the servers only came back to my table to give me my check. They didn't check on us once. Even after we made eye contact. The Larb had too much onion and rice powder. It was way too gritty. I finished a 3rd of it.
1,"Being new to town, I stopped here on my lunch hour.  For one, the parking is awful.  Two, you need binoculars to read their menu.  The print is SO SMALL.  The lady at the counter was very helpful, I must say.  She wasn't impatient, just listed the sandwiches.  I decided on a ham and cheese on multi-grain.  I asked for it to be heated.  Service was fast, and I was out of there in less than 10 minutes, I think.\nNow for the sandwich.  I had to take two bites before I hit the meat, and if I hadn't opened the sandwich, I would have thought they forgot the cheese.  VERY skimpy on the meat and cheese portions.  The bread was okay, but I've had much better at Blimpies and Port-o-Sub.  Not to mention both put a LOT more meat and cheese on their sandwiches.  Not worth the money, not going back.  Sorry, Cousins."
1,"I am extremely disappointed.  HHAGG use to be my favorite restaurant.  After last night I will never go back!  Not only was the service terrible, but the food was not up to par either.  \n\nThe waitress messed up our order by putting in the wrong plate, this after she told my daughter what she ordered was one of her favorites!  Took us about 30 minutes to get the appetizer.  When I saw food going to another party that came in after us(about 15 minutes later), with more people, I asked our waitress why they were getting food before us.  She argued with me that there was no food on or going to that table.  Three times I told her I saw it with my own eyes.  Finally she came back and said it was because we ordered an appetizer.  It was another 10 minutes before our food started coming out.  Once the error was recognized on my daughters plate, it was another 8 or so minutes before hers came out.  \n\nWe got there at 7:30 but did not walk out the door until 8:50 pm.  We have had problems in the past with the service and still we returned, but this one takes the cake.  Worst part is that they weren't very busy so you can not use that as an excuse. \n\nAfter 7 years of loyalty I will take my business else where!"
1,"Flight took off 1.5 hours late. And it's southwest, so no food, just light snacks. Waiting 1.5 hours then taking a 5 hour flight without a meal does not render a positive Yelp review."
1,Food not that great burger was dry the Spanish dip way too salty as if they threw the bottle on it. Not worth to eat here but to watch sports its good.
1,"I've only eaten there twice and both times the serve was horrible. There are only three people. One waitress, one bartender and I think one is the cook which no matter what you can't understand him. When we sat down at 6pm, it took 10 mins for them to get our drink order. Our appetizer came out pretty fast but it took another 1/2 for our food to come out. There was three people in the whole place. Now the tea I got was excellent, my food was ok tasting until I bit into spoiled chicken.  I spit it out and it smelt rancid. They wanted to make me a new dish but I refused. I about had it with this place. We waited another 1/2 an hour for our bill but never got it so we went to front to pay. All and all it took us 1-1/2 hour to finish and get out. Will not ever go back."
1,"Went here with the family for NYE dinner.  Food was half good and half horrible.  Kitchen closed and sent home all of the chefs (except the pastry chef) before we even had the plates delivered.  They should never have taken the reservation for a party of 14 at the end of the night.  They were running 40 mins behind and still seated us, but only to poorly execute the food and service. They didn't even have bread for the table or any of the entrees...this is an italian restaurant!  They finally brought us some frozen bread to try to appease us. It was still frozen in the middle.   If you are going to take a reservation at the end of the night, then you should make sure you have the right people there to execute at the level you should be for the type of restaurant you are. I live in NYC and have no problem paying higher prices for good food, but having to pay high prices for crappy food is just ridiculous.  Very disappointed and will never go back!"
1,Pho noodles here are soggy.  I'm guessing that the cook isn't washing the noodles with cold water after they are boiled.  Also the spring rolls were not so great either.
1,"Three strikes and they're out for me. First bar I been to where I need to chase the bartender for service even when business is SLOW.  Was just there and waited almost 10 minutes without even a \""hello, ill be right with you\"" That place will never get a dime from me again and I will be sure to inform EVERYONE who wants to go to a good bar that this place is NOT the place to go."
1,"This is the worst buffet I have been to in Las Vegas.\n\n It reminds mind of a comic strip that I saw in the Chicago Tribune Sports section many years ago where the whole Russian baseball team had to take the walk of shame out of the dugout into the clubhouse and be replaced by a whole new team walking from the clubhouse to the dugout because the first team sucked. This is what Ceasar's Palace should do to the chefs that work on this buffet.\n\nThe pork chops and prime rib were dried out and inedible. The apple that I tried was old with that brown stuff inside. The three bean salad had cilantro sprinkled all over, who does that? I could go on and on, I will post pictures at a later time."
1,"Some orders are too small!\nI recommended Freed's Bakery because the cakes and customer service was superior. We drove in from California just for the cake tasting and deposits. To my surprise the customer service was lacking tremendously. The bride to be was scheduled but was not given an agent.  When the bride mention; 20 guess, it was worst. The agent had the audacity to ask if she would like to taste the cake. I assumed if you're scheduled for a cake tasting appointment, cake would be included. The agent came back with a dot of cake, butter cream frosting, and two types of fillings. What a joke.\nI had plans to order my anniversary cake (200 guess) during the wedding sitting. Well we both decided not to do business with Freed's Bakery. We contacted Hansen Bakery in Los Angeles. I must say Hansen appreciated our business. Freed's don't even deserve a star.."
1,"Worst service ever. The manager took our order and then he disappeared... When the cocktail waitress came to deliver our nachos (which took 20 min), my bf asked if he could have another beer and she kinda went.. I guess.. Cause she wasn't taking care of us. She only had one table so it's not like she was busy. After that she would not even walk by us or make eye contact. Both me and my bf are in the service industry and were pretty upset about it. We understand when people are busy, but another thing is to not care. We cancelled our dinner order and asked for the check. The manager apologized and said he only had one cook and he was busy. We didn't care if the food was taking long but we never had a chance to order drinks. $40 for 2 beers, a martini, nachos and a cup of soup... never again."
1,"I was offered internet sufficient to stream video for $29.99, and then when called to set up appointment to install service I asked what I would be charged and was told $34.95. I then called customer service to discuss what I would be paying and was told the $34.95. I explained that I had been quoted less, and the agent told me he could not do anything to help me. I think service providers should honor their word. I will use a carrier that is truthful and honest."
1,"I made a reservation for 5 (two of my friends heard me) When we for there they had us down for 4. They WOULD NOT accommodate us by adding another chair to our table, even if it was their mistake.  The hostess was unapologetic and said we would have to wait 45 minutes for a table for 5. We took the table for 4 as we were going to see a show later.  My husband went to pick up the tickets and when he returned our waiter was very nice and prepared a place for him. We were able to secure an extra  chair from an adjacent table.  The front staff was rude and I could not believe the poor customer service! If the food was excellent I might have forgiven the rude greeting, but unfortunately the food was mediocre.  Only saving grace  was our waiter."
1,"My wife and I wanted to try this restaurant out for awhile. So I called to see if they have lunch spot open. The reservationist told us just come on over theres no wait, when we arrived the hostess told us theres a 45mins wait....The reservationist could of told us earlier save us a 45mins drive from Summerlin."
1,"This location isnt cooperate owned, service was bad they sat us at our table it took ten minutes before we were visited by a server about drinks. The restaurant wasn t even that busy and our waitress was rude and impatient when asking about sauce selections. I asked for extra sides of ranch and they charge for every side even though its not tuesday or thursday. I also filled out a survey that gives $5 off and when i went to redem it at this location they said since they are not cooperate they only offer $4 off. On top of that they changed the wing prices to snack, small, medium, and large portions. Me and my son used to split 24 wings for $19.99 which is already alot but now the large portion is 21 wings for $19.99. While this isn t a big deal just feels like they make up there own rules."
1,Worst customer service ever!! Niru and palak who work there and probably owns it need some customer service training. Bad attitude and bad service to loyal customers. Never going there again! They just lost loyal customer.\n\nPS- I gave them one star cuz I have to otherwise they deserve 0 for customer service. I hope this is not a norm for dunkin owners!
1,Every time I go here it is always super crowded and there is never enough staff. Be sure to check your dates on everything you buy.  The last several times I shopped here the food was expired and several things were clearly rotten. Found a tray of cheese with mold om it. Would not go here ever again.
1,"thought we would try it we had a coupon from them for buy one get one 50% off,\nwe went in sit down and gave the waitress the coupon , she left a minute or two later the owner or manager came out ,and said he would not take the coupon even though it was his and still date good, well i felt like i was being played so we left, i guss that they just dont need new business,it's not like there is  shortage of chinese restaurants in town,for about 2 dollars they may have had a new customer,PS there was no one else in there but us,i all ways thought coupons where to get people to try your place,well to make a long story longer,i am really sorry that we both may have lost out,"
1,"Really bad food. We ordered their \""special\""  of the day which was the lobster hash and a quiche. The lobster really chewy and smelled really fishy. They wouldn't accommodate a fried egg on top of the hash instead of scrambled either. The quiche was cold in the center and seemed like it was reheated in the microwave. We asked to get something different instead and ordered a cobb salad and blueberry muffin which we hoped would be safer choices, but alas, they were not. The salad was really small for a $17 dollar salad and really gross chunks of bacon fat in it. The blueberry muffin appeared as if it had been microwaved as well and was dried out. Lunch was practically inedible and with all of our complaints a manager never so much as looked out way. We were extremely dissapointed!\n\nOh also water is $7 and they won't tell you there is a charge until you get the bill!"
1,"Not impressed. First, only certain theaters have service. You can order food and take it in but then you have to sit in the seat with a plate in your lap. Not very comfortable. Second, the food is mediocre at best. Tried the hummus and it had obviously been scooped out of a can with what was probably the last of a bag of pita chips. Lots of crumbs. Third, $7.50 for a 12 oz beer is ridiculous. Fourth, we couldn't take drinks into the theater because it is one that children are allowed into. This despite the fact that an R rated movie was playing.  Lastly, the seating is not clear. We entered a theatre during the previews and it was dark and somewhat crowded. We found the two seats together and sat down. But, a manager kicked us out of the seats because they were the special kind that you pay extra for. By this time, there were no other seats other than the second row. Pure digital or not, the picture sucked. They need to have someone to check the tickets of people who try to sit in the special seats. Overall, it was very disappointing."
1,Specified that I was shipping an item for Easter that needed to get there prior to Sunday. I was told they could ship it for Friday delivery and I verified again that it was important to get there prior to Easter. I was again assured of the Friday delivery. Well it is Saturday and because it was not moved from the store in time it was delayed and I am told they won't ship Saturday unless a Saturday shipment is specified.So the package was sent late and no effort was made to make up that fact to ensure timely delivery. I will never use UPS again!
1,This place is a real dump. Glad I changed to the other Travelodge close to MGM rather than this one. The staff was friendly but the hotel is in dire need of an update or maybe a fire.  There are many better bu diet hotels for less money in town.
1,"the watts premier reverse osmosis water filter system, (model: ro-pure) wastes 4 gallons of water for every one gallon it purifies! \ndo you call this enviromentally friendly?  \nwatts should print this information in large letters on the outside of the box!\nof course they may not sell many when the consumers read it!\ni am returning the system i bought last month to costco for a full refund and will purchase a pur system.\n\nsubmitted by;  \ngreg lancaster\npalm springs, ca"
1,"Ok. Re doing my review. \n\nCheck in I wasn't told that detail takes on average witch I find hard to be figure out why yes detail is hard work but in Phx where there are alot of guys on detail line crew. This took 2 1/2 hours. I was not told anytime when I signed up for it. So here I am waiting over 2 hours getting pissed due to fact my car came out fast and thought it was ready. The one person that did care was the person who rang me up. I didn't catch his name, but the second time he came outside to talk witch was close to the 2 hour point I was a little pissed and I think he saw. Offered to get the \"" so called manager\"" I explained to him that I waited 2 hours without a time. His come back that he would explain to staff to tell customers. He didn't offer any offers like half off car wash etc. since we live in the area and use there services all the time. I felt bad for detail line. They had 3 guys on shift Monday  full bay plus some yahoo wanted to detail a buss so took 2 guys off the line and left 1 guy. I would of pushed the card out of your bay first then detail the buss I personally won't be back. Not even a percent off next service meh."
1,"No thanks. This event was an opportunity to view trashy people in their natural habitat. Mediocre music (I'm being charitable.), some decent beers and a bunch of over-tattooed guys and duck-faced girls posing...trying to show all of Facebook just how cool they are. Pass."
1,"Long line at nearby Starbucks do went to DD for a frozen ice tea lemonade. Cashier kept asking me to repeat the order, although there was a huge poster in the window hawking it. Order filler brought out a cup of brown liquid and said \""here's your ice tea.\"". I asked about the lemonade part. He asked the cashier if that was what I had really ordered. (I was the only customer at 9 am.) Confirming my order, he returned in a bit with a lighter colored beverage. I took a sip outside and spit it out. It tasted like Lysol. Bad fake lemonade. I threw the mess out. Yuck."
1,"TERRIBLE!!!! The wait time is unsatisfactory and the staff is miserable. Perhaps the staff members are miserable because Dr Alfreda is scamming the elderly and hard working individuals out of their hard earned money. \nI went to Dr Alfreda because I saw good reviews online and I was looking for a new primary care doctor. I waited 45 minutes to see Dr Alfreda and when I finally did meet him, he was in a rush and performed a routine physical evaluation. He looked in my ear and said I had a small amount of wax, he then proceeded to take it out of my ear which took about 10 seconds and is a job a q-tip could have easily performed. One month later I received a bill for $75.00 for this so-called procedure. What a total scam!!!"
1,"I came here on August 31st, my husband ordered three tacos, and we decided to eat there. There was no one else in the joint, and we waited about 5 minutes. The tacos came, and my husband tells me he ordered them soft, so I told him I would go and return them. I told the girl who was working and she said \""he didn't say soft\"" I was taken aback so I told her if that was the case I would pay extra for giving us soft tacos. I think I was very nice. She then says \"" if I do that, I'll throw those ones out\"" so I say \"" so I'm stuck with these.\"" Which she turns around and starts talking with her crew.  What makes this worse is I contacted the company with no response. It's one thing to have a rude crew, it's another for a company not to care. Terrible, I should of read all the reviews first."
1,"AVOID!\n\nI had a reservation for a non-smoking room and they gave me the run around saying they were full and \""upgraded\"" us to a smoking room suite. This room was so putrid it made my fiance extremely nauseous. After much \""discussion,\""  they found another room to put us in that wasn't as bad.\n\nUpon checkout, I found that my original reservation was canceled and the prices I agreed upon were inflated by 25% (which is not fun when you have a budget set for your trip). I asked about it and then received a snippy comment from the guy behind the counter and said to call his manager if I had an issue. And then he slammed the business card down in front of me.\n\nI'm contacting Best Western right now to see about their company policies regarding pricing, room switching, and dishonesty."
1,This was a terrible experience. Slowwwwwwwwe service and zero interest from the wait staff in being helpful. There was not enough good meats ever. Really subpar are every front
1,"Hands down the worst rental car experience ever! Spent over an hour waiting in line to pick up my car.  No one moves with a sense of urgency.  My car was OK but dirty, it even had a butter knife in the seat.  They didn't even clean the windshield. Upon return it didn't take too long but it took over 30 minutes for the shuttle to arrive.  On the shuttle all 20 passengers had nothing but complaints of terrible service.  Won't use them again."
1,Food was way overpriced for the taste. Beans overcooked. Tortillas seemed stale. Server was horrible. Avoid this place. Dont waste ur $. Sorry bout iiiiit.
1,"Ate lunch here one day and the burger was solid, beer was cold.\n\nWhat did me in in terms of probably never going back here was Friday night.  My wife and I sat down and when the waitress came over we were ready to order, she took our order with attitude, and when I said thank you and handed her the menu's she ripped them out of my hands and walked away with out saying anything.  I proceeded to tell her to \""lose the fucking attitude\"" and got up and walked out.  \n\nI don't expect A+ service from this place nor an overly enthusiastic wait staff, but don't be rude, rip the menu's from my hand and act like a total bitch.\n\nI will never go back here on principle alone.  Kind of a shame, because I like the place."
1,BEWARE!!!!!!!\n\nStayed at Planet Hollywood Resort and their staff STOLE a pair of expensive pair boots while my wife was taken to emergency due to illness!!!
1,Avoid at all costs worst service in Vegas. The food is way over priced for the quality. If your looking for dessert in the Caesars Palace area I would reccomend the Cheesecake Factory in the Forum Shops at Caesars.
1,6$ for a large Americano which was bitter and tasted like coffee was burned? Not worth it.\n\nNot coming back here again.
1,"I had a pizza delivered and it was soggy and doughy. The rest of the food (wings, jalape\u00f1o poppers, fried cucumbers) were pretty lousy too. The customer service I received while trying to resolve this was a joke. I will never be back and would never recommend this place to anyone I know."
1,"Not a good experience.  We usually come on the weekends now and then for a nice wine and lunch experience.  This time, both were bad.  First, they quit carrying the Falling Star Sauvignon Blanc, and had no other Sauvignon Blanc to offer.  The waiter took forever to get me any wine at all.  I have asked a few times in the past months for them to carry the Falling Star again, but no avail.  My chicken torta was dry and horrible.  It literally had no flavor, I had to ask for mayonaise!!   I have had some amazing tortas in my life and I was expecting something fabulous.   Service was so very slow, we were so disappointed.  I love the building, the huge patio, the chance to buy fresh produce, and the food used to be very good, but I probably won't be back again.  With high prices, I expect amazing food and a good drink selection.  Table salsas were very good though."
1,"My wife just took our kids here for a haircut, and we found out the gal who had been doing the kids haircuts previously just left. We thought no biggie and just went with it, but it was brutal! Her replacement couldn't stand to cut my kid's hair because he moved a lot and was crying. (He's 2 years old...that's what they do!) So let me get this straight...you want to cut kids hair, but won't do it if they're crying or moving around?  Good luck with that!  After her dirtly looks and complaints, they just left and went to Cool Cuts where they pulled it off like pros.  We won't be back, which is too bad because we've been going there for a while."
1,"Imagine the worst smell possible.  Now imagine that ten times worst surrounding the very air you breathe, burning your nostrils as it enters your body.  The staircase outside our room had the worst smell known to mankind.  And everyday, it seemed liked the smell would grow stronger, and stronger.  Smelled like some drunk crazy person urinated all over the staircase.  And then some animal died there, and that same crazy person urinated all over that too.  Everytime we used those stairs, we would hold our breath praying that we would make it out alive.\n\nAnyways, the hotel is.. eh.  Parking sucks.  The rooms are old.  The elevators will scare the crap out of anyone who's claustrophobic.  Thing is tiny and moves slower than a turtle climbing up stairs.  \n\nThe casino... the air is filled with nothing but smoke.  I felt sick everytime I had to walk through it.  \n\nPlus side... they're going to destroy the hotel and build a brand new one."
1,"Talk about a cess pool of incompetent people. Took an hour to get my car washed. Every one of their employees I spoke with likely didn't graduate high school and, based on their ability to articulate, it's doubtful that they've spoken to a Human being in years. \n\nEmbarrassingly poor company."
1,They didn't help me with anything and I went on 4 different occasions and still have the problem thanks for nothing
1,"Bad, bad, so disappointed with Zumanity show, poor, when you mention Cirque du Soleil you expect a lot! This s not my first time in this Cirques, but this one was the worst, I'm from LA and  I had guests from Va. That weekend and I offer to  take  them to see this show!!  I wanted they see how beautiful is Cirque du   Soleil, wrong decision. I wish I have my money back, I spend on 6 tickets."
1,"If I could give this company 0 stars I would do.  OWNERS STAY AWAY!!!  Do not trust these people with your property.  They are dishonest, disrespectful and incompetent and I am happy to provide more details on our disastrous dealing with them to anyone who wants the story.  I will be reporting them to the BBB."
1,Hands down the worst Indian food I had in Montreal. Service is TERRIBLE. It took em over an hour to bring our food out. The food isn't good at all. Don't bother going here\n\nFood -  Meh\nService - Terrible\nAmbiance - Ok \nWorth the money - No
1,"Our first experience here was ok, but breakfast this morning warrants the one star review.  We ordered eggs and oatmeal.  We carefully explained that the eggs must be fully cooked through.  After waiting 30 minutes, we received barely warm oatmeal and runny eggs.  \nWe explained again about the eggs and they said that they would make them again.  20 minutes later, another plate of runny eggs!\nAt that point they said that they would take the eggs off the bill.\n\n\nMy oatmeal somehow wound up costing over $20 but we just wanted to get out of there so I did not ask any more questions."
1,"Holy shit, we just gave this place another chance and man, what a disappointment. \n\nWhen we arrived 80% of the restaurant was full. We were seated quickly by an efficient hostess. \nAfter 10 minutes we received water. \n10 minutes after THAT our server took both drink and food orders. \nThen it was another 15 before we received the drinks!\nThen another 10 goes by and the food comes out, fairly quickly. But they only brought out half the food. So we're all still sitting there, awkwardly, until the final two plates come out. \nOne of the two final plates was loaded with cheese that was requested held. So the entire plate had to be re-made. \nA shrimp plate had visible veins left in the shrimp.\nA chicken taco plate consisted of chicken in a stale flour tortilla - with a side of rice and cabbage. No pico de gallo, no guacamole... basically, nothing to dress the tacos. \nAnother beer was ordered and didn't show up until we were finished eating. \nSo what it comes down to is this: Servers need training and the food items need to be re-evaluated."
1,We'll the food is good but the conversations we had to listen to from the staff was disgusting. I would somewhat get it if they were in the back and I heard it but they were sitting at a table eating at the table next to us having the conversation the whole time we were there. \n\nThey have lost my business for good and I won't be back.
1,"This hotel is loud at all hours of the night which the non-smoking room smelling of smoke in the middle of the night and an owner who wouldn't give us towels and said, \""do me a favor and use the dirty ones.\"" Then only gave us two and said that's it (there are three of us.)"
1,First of all I gave them 1 star because there is no 0 star!!! I just went there for oil change and car wash. They made me wait for 2 hours and 10 minutes. Should I say something else?? Also I'll make sure that no one goes there!!!!
1,"Holy smokes-awful.   Should have trusted my first impression.   \n\nThe food was barely edible and was billed a different price then listed on the menu.  \n\nBigger yet, the table next to me sent her margarita back because she ordered without a salt rim.  The drink came and of course had a salted rim.   The bartender refused to take back and was just going to wipe it off!   She can not have added salt, make a new damn drink, service 101."
1,"I am rating them on the following.  Giant Pretzel $14 (it was not worth $14 maybe $7 or $8), beer's $8 ok,  lemonade $3 and the zinger is you can't get a glass of water with your beer or mixed coctail, you have to pay $3.49 for a bottle of water (that is just lame especially when you are buying a drink)."
1,"I have ordered from here a handful of times and it has progressively gotten worse the last 3 or 4 times. Tonight is definitely the last time I order from here. Very basic pizza, just cheese and pineapple. I opened the box and the pizza was burnt. I take a bite and there is no sauce! I mean I had to lift up the burnt cheese to check for sauce! I love pizza crust, but it wasn't edible. So let's sum this up, no sauce, burnt and dry. Yep, pretty sure I've had better Little Caeser's back in the day."
1,"There were several issues with this place with our visit around 6pm tonight.  The first one was a clear lack of English speakers in places that were needed to communicate with customers.  This caused a multitude of problems.  First, it took about 10 minutes to get my order taken with two parties in front of me because the others took so many attempts to place their order and not get understood or questions answered clearly (while other employees stood around and did nothing).\n\nOnce placing our order of just two salad bars and soup, we then walked down to the end of the counter.  We are immediately told what I think was it would be brought to our table as the person pointed.  No problem, but after five minutes we went back to the counter while nobody was doing anything and told again that it would be brought to the table.  Seriously?  At least give us our salad bowls after 10 minutes.\n\nAfter about five more minutes we give up and go back and our bowl of soup and two empty bowls are sitting on the counter with nobody around so I just pick it up.\n\nThis location need to have people that can communicate with the customers and does not need to take 15 minutes +/- to provide two bowls and a cup of soup, especially with how empty the restaurant was."
1,"Horrible. Some friends of mine and I were here one night before going to Marquee and hit this place up. The sushi place was too busy so this looked like the next best thing. We started with 3 appetizers- the potato wrapped chorizo, white asparagus, patadas bravas. We were so turned off by the quality of the food we never ordered meals and left hungry. \n\nEnough said."
1,"I placed an order with Erik and this server had the hardest time taking a simple order, the whole group suffers with a lack of brains!   You want to get annoyed go to this Popeyes and eat.   The owner should go on mystery dinners.   They could double their money if the place get rid of the current staff  and hired some leadership!"
1,Wish there was an option for -stars! They obviously don't read these reviews because their customer service is horrible!! They could care less when they hang up on you 4 times after trying to be transferred. Or they promise you one price but forget to tell you about all of the ad ons they charge for! After 3 yrs of service since I don't have a choice t you think there would be some kind of loyalty but heck no! It's always the customers fault never them. Tried to speak to a Supervisor and her attitude was horrible! Cox is horrible don't use them unless you have no choice like myself!
1,"Worst service and meal I've had in a long time. We were a large group but it is no excuse to have to wait over an hour to get the bottle of wine that I ordered. When it arrived I had to turn it away because it was AWFUL. I ordered a bourbon instead and that took another 20 minutes to arrive. \n\nSo almost 2 hours in and I hadn't even ordered yet. When the food finally arrived an hour later, I was not impressed. The place was way too bright, I felt in a cafeteria. My bill was around $100 alone for an appetizer, a main and two drinks. Way overpriced for a mediocre place and brutal service."
1,What a disaster. On Saturday night of a three day weekend they had two people working the front desk. Needless to say there was an endless line. When it was finally our turn they could not find our reservation and were completely snarky about it. The guy that we spoke to was the front desk manager and was not helpful in any way. He simply told us we could book a room with them for $350 a night. Way too much for this cheesefest of a hotel. Headed to the Monte Carlo and they made us feel very welcome.
1,"What happened to this place? I used to live by this place and it was always a great sushi and bento spot. That has really changed over the years. \n\nI think with all of the AYCE spot in LV, Kaizen must have felt left out. Now they have AYCE and it seems the menu items have suffered because of it. The sushi is still decent, but taking non-sushi eaters like our nieces and nephews is not an option. The Chicken Katsu was sooooo sad. It was like a super flat, dry piece of chicken that was hardly breaded and were cut into 1/4\"" strips. It was worse than chicken straws at Burger King. \n\nThe chicken teriyaki was more like a sweet stir fry. The rice was hard and the salad was completely soaked with dressing. My wife likes her dressing, but this was overkill. \n\nThe service was pretty sporty as well. Our waitress took our order, but she didn't seem to know the menu. She insisted they didn't have chicken udon, but we showed her the menu and she said she was mistaken. Ummmm... Ya..... Our food came out at all different times and it just didn't seem as organized. \n\nI think overall it was a pretty bad experience. I think they are so focused on making AYCE work, that everything else is suffering. I hope they rethink that business practice. Not everyone goes AYCE."
1,Sorry sorry...poop on the floor. I was placed in a dirty examine room. Not returning. And I don't care for the fact they take the dog in the back for shots.
1,"Went on free day.  I was not at all impressed.  Too many screaming kids and the museum itself is definitely geared towards children with nothing to impress adults.  As a museum it was sort very disorganized and it seems some displays were missing.  The signage was poor.  The dinosaur displays were impressive along with some of the minerals, but they were just stuck there without much chronology.  It was weird to have native american displays and the jail in a museum of \""natural history\"".  It's sort of a hodgepodge.  The kids seemed to be having fun slamming the jail doors and screaming and running around.  I expected a bit more even for a museum in Mesa and I also expected more from parents regarding their children.  Won't ever go back."
1,"Mr. Pineapple sounded like a nice guy and his prices are good. The problem is that he is not reliable.\n\nA tenant left and I wanted to get front and back yards cleaned before the new tenants moved in. So, I called him and got an estimate. The price was good so I asked him to get the work done. He said he will do it on  the 07/05/14. He didn't do it. Then, when I called him, he said he will do it on the 07/11/14. He didn't do it. Then when I called him on 07/12/14, he didn't even bother to pick up the phone or call me back.\n\nNew tenants moved in on 07/12/14 and it wasn't fun. Yikes!"
1,Last call is a 1130pm.  Fail.  The Bourbon steak bar is awesome cuz there is nobody in it.  Fat people are loners.
1,"Was absolutely disappointed with dining here was expecting alot more being that Bobby Flay has his name attached. First off this is simply above a Carl Jr's sorry to say but it is, and you get served off of plastic plate, interior looks super hip and cool, but when your burger is brought out, it reminds me of going to a weekend BBQ gathering served by uncle Fred who has been drinking beers and cooking your burgers. \n\nWe ordered the NM Burger obviously residing in NM we thought heck lets give it a try, the condiments over killed the burger itself and the presentation was very juvenile and it made me feel like I said \""Uncle Fred\"" made it....... the meat itself was pretty bland and quite small even for the low cost definitely not worth it. The price is good, but I would rather pay more to get a quality burger that is culinary inspired and using good quality condiments. \n\nThe staff was friendly and attentive but when asked what we thought, we replied okay, she said well you order a burger right, so that is what you got a \""Burger\"" they all taste the same there is nothing to it. I would never want my staff to respond that way to a guest, but as I said this is a glorified Carl Jrs, sorry Bobby Flay I would definitely take my name off so that you dont ruin your reputation or get some better training for  your staff that represents YOU!!"
1,"When we first got there we loved the drinks and the decor of the bar. As the night went on our service was terrible. \n\nThey had a barback serving us even though it wasnt too busy. He didn't know what he was doing and never came to check on us...we tracked him down for each drink we ordered. Then at the end of the night when we asked for our checks he swiped our cards before we could even see our tab. Then come to find out he mixed up all of our cards and charged us wrong amounts. When we questioned it we got an attitude from the other bartenders who had to help him. When we asked for an itemized receipt they told us we should have requested one from the beginning and it \""would take forever\"" for them to find ours. \n\nAlso the womens bathroom was very dirty. The trashcan was overflowing onto the floor and there was what seemed to be pee on the floor along with toilet paper all over the place.\n\nWe are going to Crave next time..."
1,I came in to get advice on anti aging products. The only employee that was helpful was the greeter. In the back there was three employees standing together and when I asked for help it was like dealing with some Heathers. I have good skin which I invest a lot of research and money in maintaining. When I mentioned I wanted to look up reviews on the only product one of then pointed out the employee took me to their touch screen and left me to my own devices. \nIf you want help getting skin advice go to ulta like I did.
1,"This is my first time here and I must say, FIRST IMPRESSIONS LAST. \n\nThey SUCK! Service sucks. The Pho Tai here sucks. I got maybe 5 strips of steak. \nWe had 4 different guys serving us. You wave your hand calling for one's attention and they ignore you, straight up! They look the other way. That's why we had 4 different ones. \n\nI had a better service at a 'mom and pop' pho place in San Diego than this place, considering this is a tourist town. Their egg roll is rock solid. One order is 4 pieces, unlike 6 in SD. Their calamari is oilier than a porn stars butt! \n\nNot coming back!! Seriously, just go somewhere else. 1000+ people and this place has 3+ average. Go figure!"
1,"Waitress here are so f**king rude, no drinks, no side dishes, no menu, no one takes care in almost half hour since we walked in. Strongly recommend u guys do not go there!"
1,"In August I purchased a wedding album for our pictures.  It did not have enough sleeves for the photos but the gal Erin told me I could get the refill pages at Walmart, their site etc.  I looked at over 20 sites and called their 800 number, no luck.  They said they are on back order and don't know if they would ever get them in.  I just wanted an exchange for another album but was told no because I didn't have the original receipt I couldn't.  I had a copy of my cc statement showing the transaction.   I charged back.\n\nMake sure you find refill pages before you do anything with them as they don't honor their returns."
1,"Did a lousy job and pressured my wife into buying additional services.  Hand smudges on the walls and nicked up the paint in a number of places.  I found one vent cover they hadn't even bothered taking off.  Eventually got the owner to provide a partial refund, but I'd stay away from these folks.  Even with the cheap Groupon coupon, they are way more trouble than they are worth."
1,Very disappointed. This restaurant has done a nose dive in the past few years. Tonight I tried to order chicken fingers and they couldn't figure out how to cook them. So I had to order something else. Nachos were a safe bet right?  Wrong the cheese whiz nachos were horrible. I won't be coming back here again.
1,"This dentist is a crook! Glad to see his office has closed! I sincerely hope he has retired and gone back to title loans or used car sales. \nI went to him a year ago and he told me that I had 6 cavities. I had only had one my entire life! When told that with my insurance it was going to cost nearly $900, I held off getting the work done. \nI moved out of Gilbert and just went to a new dentist. Crazy enough he didn't find a single cavity!!! My new dentist has a large monitor in front of you that shows you your X-rays and everything he writes in his exam. I will never again go to a dentist that doesn't do the sane thing!"
1,"I agree that \""not all Macys are created equal\"" because some are nicer than others with clean floors and attentive staff. That said, the Macys in Minnesota are good, but the ones in Las Vegas are not in the least. The phone customer service is horrible and I was sent defective merchandise twice in the mail. Macys, overall, has been going downhill for some time and I am no longer a customer after 30 years.  Nordstroms and Amazon have my business now."
1,"Horrible experience pls don't go this place it will make you sick not fresh food at all the rice taste bad, hard and re heat  I don't have even words to describe how bad it was"
1,"Can I give no stars? This airport needs to be torn down and rebuilt. It feels like it was designed by some kids on a beach somewhere. It's poorly marked, nothing was open, it was spring break for some but all the vending machines were about empty. Driving into Phoenix would be much better."
1,"Don't waste your time going to this show. For the price, I was expecting so much more. It was distasteful & not entertaining at all. Halfway through, i was bored & wishing I was somewhere else. I should have paid attention to the negative reviews that were posted. What a joke..."
1,"AHHHH really!!! Walked in to ask a question, and lady sitting at the desk looked up from her book and looked at us and replied \""What\"" i was so shocked i laughed out loud. Thats how you talk to costumers..... So sorry we bothered you from reading your book! So rude!!!"
1,"Horrible customer service the guy getting our cab RANDY was a duch\u00e9 bag he wasnt considerate of peoples mood he just immediately judged and gave EXTREME ATTITUDE. WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS PLACE BECAUSE OF RANDY. Thanks VDARA glad I stayed here.\n\nSuggestion, get rid of your horrible terrible employees such as RANDY getting people cabs. Not a very informed guy."
1,"Too bad this place can't be given ZERO stars, because that's exactly what they deserve. This review is long overdue, however I waited to see if the situation would remedy itself. I took my beautiful long hair cat to them for a lion cut almost a year and a half ago and they BUTCHERED HER. Not only did they shave off her undercoat, they nicked her in at least 5 different spots along her back, belly, and tail- all of which took a very long time to heal up because of cat's constant grooming. Long story short, her coat has been ruined because of the hack jobs they have doing the grooming here. When I called to find out if it was normal that my cat's fur was not growing back (6 months later) they treated me like I was the biggest idiot in the world on the phone. Now my cat looks patchy, and she has multiple BALD spots on her body and there isn't a damn thing that I can do about it except try to warn others to stay away from here!\n\nDO NOT - I REPEAT - DO NOT TAKE YOUR ANIMAL HERE FOR GROOMING OR THEY WILL BE RUINED BY NON-TRAINED HACKS!!!!!!!"
1,"i have been to this place 5 times......EVERY time i feel like i get treated differently than everyone else. Most of their clients are as we call them \""gringos\"" I immediatly notice the differnent attention I get for being a latina...............but it still does not stop me from buying their amazing cakes. ive tried all of them best is the whitechocolate raspberry, worst is lkemon tastes like made out of a box."
1,Don't stay here. You have to carry your own luggage up the stairs. No elevator.  Staff not helpful at all.
1,"Horrible. Customer service is non existent. No greeting when you walk in, no one to offer help. Stood at the fitting room entrance for 5 minutes with a stroller. Kim walked out passed me with a hand full of clothes and went on about her business. I stood for another minute before I had to ask if I could be let in. She seemed irritated that she had any business. On my way out she was standing in the largest opening between racks of clothes and wouldn't move. So I had to squeeze through a small area with a stroller. Please. I wouldn't waste another dollar here."
1,"I checked on yelp if Carls Jr was open Thanksgiving & it said yes. Came to the drive thru and some one told me to look over the menu and let them know when I was ready to order. I waited... And waited. They never came back. Lights were on inside but 10 min later no one came back. Drove up to the actual window, no one there. RUDE!!!! Don't say you will be open if you don't have workers that are going to actually work."
1,"Health hazard! Decor and extremely high price suggests high quality, handmade food.  It's not.\n\nTaste is awful. That's actually not my main complaint. Taste is suggestive after all.  Trying to be Din Tai Fung I think.\n\nPortions are miniscule.  $25 for three tiny shrimp.  Appetizers are bigger than this place's entrees.\n\nHowever, my main problem is the fact that they serve raw meat.  And it's not steak tartare.  It was a won ton noodle soup.  Won tons are supposed to be pork and shrimp.  No shrimp.  That would cost them too much.  This was corn starch, gravy, and some meat I think was pork.  Yes, it was awful.  Not the main problem.  Owner insulted me and we got into an argument about it.  He said I didn't understand what fusion food is.  Fine.  We'll agree to disagree.  It doesn't change the fact that the pork was RAW!  You can't serve raw pork!  You can pass intestinal worms that way.\n\nOur poor waiter was so embarrassed.  He even said that he doubted he would see us again but if he did, he hoped they would have improved.  The health department will probably shut them down first."
1,"Service is just bad. Very disorganized place. \n\nWent in with a medium group of friends on a Friday around 5pm. Ordered drinks and appetizers .... Food arrived before the drinks.  Like 5 minutes before. Really?\n\nFood is average corporate crap. Edible. But not 'good' by any means. Had onion rings, fried shrooms, and a burger. All was plain-jane, uninspiring and bland.  Despite the waitress saying how 'amazing' the burger we ordered would be. Hardly .... \n\nService was bad. My girlfriend had to get up several times to go inside and make requests for things the server forgot. Like the straw she asked for twice.  When asking for our tab, the server returned with others, not ours.  Then came out with a huge stack of receipts and had to go thru them all to find our tab and a few others. Just a poorly managed place. No one seems to really know what they are doing. And the food definitely isn't worth having that kind of patience. \n\nI won't be back to this location. In fact, I prefer to patronize smaller non- corporate bars and restaurants. I only went for the company of good friends. And that would be the ONLY reason I'd return to BWW ....  ever."
1,The WORST Best Buy I've ever been to.  I was charged $231.27 for an AMP install ... and they crossed the wiring so my right speaker was in the front left and the left speaker was in the right back ... and it kept shorting out on me.  And it sounded like compete shit (go figure) because they never played with the settings.  I went to the Manager Kevin S (he would NOT give me his last name) and he was a total unhelpful prick.  Anthony was the kid who f'ed up my install ... finally I got Keith to FIX the mess up ... Shop ANYWHERE but this store run by complete ASSHOLE PRICKS.  And what ever you do don't let Anthony touch your vehicle!
1,"I rarely write a review; however, cannot resist the temptation after a horrible experience here. First of all, the food vs price is incomparably unjustified. I took my wife and kids there, paid close to $100 for 4 people, and the food quality was unbearable. The fish felt rubbery, the shrimp was not fresh at all, the crab leg had too much salt in it. ALL OF THEM ARE FROZEN FOOD, and felt like cooked by a high school student. I felt very bad during the entire dinner and felt like asking my money back the whole time.\n\nIn addition, the server was horrible, our drink was all empty and i had to ask for a water refill for my kids, and he didnt even bother to ask me for a refill. My wife and i had to survive the whole experience with 1 glass of drink. I lost my appetite already and didnt even bother to ask for refill.\n\nThey charge $25 for adult, my advise, pay more for Wicked Spoon at Cosmopolitan, or try Le Village at Paris. \n\nDO NOT EAT in this restaurant. This restaurant has just made it into the top of my worst restaurant to eat list."
1,"Horrible.... I might be bias because I'm asian and I live in San Francisco so I'm used to a certain standard and quality of Chinese food. I only went to this place because we had a 50% discount on our main dish. And it was still pretty expensive. But it's on the LV strip so I can't expect $5 dishes. \n\nBut the food was horrible. I can taste the MSG in the sauce. And the meat didn't even taste like meat. It was so mushy I felt like I was eating tofu shaped beef. I tried the singapore noodles, which was a bad idea. It was very bland... that's the best thing I can say about it. \n\nThe service was okay... It wasn't the greatest service, but definitely wasn't the worst. Our meal came out quickly, which is a plus. \n\nBut I wouldn't recommend this place."
1,"This is so below average. The restaurant decor is out dated and worn out.  Poor service below average breakfast and how do you even screw up breakfast. Manager asked how was everything I said \""just ok\""he said ok did not inquire. Food did not have quality flavor it was very bland."
1,"If this place had zero stars I would have given them that ! Let me start off by saying I was so excited to read all great reviews so maybe I just came in on a off day? We walked in and were seated came over and asked if we wanted water or tea I guess they don't serve anything Else, Then we placed an order pork dumplings and sticky rice nasty! Then I asked if they served egg rolls they said they were out!!! they pushed their little carts around with hot plates that basically steam the food and is not fresh and what you get is soggy poor customer service we had to get up and look for someone to give us our tab so we could get the heck out of there are get some real food. It looked like it would be a great place for groups of people would not recommend if you are on mission for what you want and want to place an order but it could be a fun experience for some people."
1,"DO NOT BOOK THROUGH Jet Luxury for the Vdara. Plus when I complained about something & then told it would be taken care of- it WAS NOT!! So never again will I stay at the Vdara, and I will spread the word!!!"
1,"After the response from the GM, Clay wanting to make things better for me from my original review posted on here a month ago, I still have yet to get a call back from him. I did call him per his request from a facebook message. Unfortunately, I called at a bad time (6pm), and I knew that, so I left my name and number with Clay and expected a call back because he was very busy at the time. I understood, but it has been over 3 weeks now. I was hoping to share with him my bad experience. I was not looking for a free dinner. Just a chance to let him know how was treated and ignored once the hostess realized my party of 3 was waiting for a friend just a few minutes away. However, if you saw my review from less than a month ago she was very rude and never offered to seat us in the cantina area, and I didn't even think of that since my son was just 14. But either way, I'm done with trying to resolve my treatment with Clay and assure you I will not be back for to try and make things better."
1,I absolutely agree!!!! This staff need to be trained in compassion and customer service. This location needs a total overhaul  of its staff!!!!!!! THE WORST!!!!!!
1,"Let me start by apologizing for not posting sooner. 2 months ago....I am still trying to forget the horrible nightmare I experienced here. I was so hungry, long busy day at work, I decide to break for lunch, treat myself...normally I bring lunch from home.  I decide on my old favorite China go go.  I rush back to my office and start scarfing down my Kung Pao lunch combo.  The noodles were nasty, so I move on to my entree, after two bites I see the antenea of dead roasted  daddy ROACH!! I puke, gag, dry heave!!! I have a cucstomer walk in about an hour later, Im still shaking, I could cry I just ate kung roach pao!!! Worst experience ever!  Once I stop puking I call in and they offer to make me a new dish?!!!?? Really  NO THANKS!!!!"
1,"What a waste of my money!  I can pan fry a burger at home and it will still taste much better that this place.  To think I spent almost $30 here, makes me angry...I want my money back.\n\nMy daughter got the Oreo shake which was really good.  But the burger was extremely disappointing.  Don't even get me started at how gross the veggie fries were....YUCK!"
1,"Worst experience EVER!!! I ordered an item and was told it would take 7-10 business days... 30 days later i finally get a call saying my item has arrived... I was upset that no one could take the time to call me and explain to me that the item was gonna take longer than told to me! On top of that, they didnt even offer me a price break on the shipping (which was only $10 dollars, but it was the principle of the matter for me...) not to mention, this was my first visit to this company... upon browsing around and asking about certain items, on my list of things to get, i was told that they didnt have anything i was looking for and that I would have to order it... \n\nI will NEVER visit this store again nor will I suggest this store to any of my photographers on staff!!!! Worst EXPERIENCE EVER!!! \n\nStay Away!!! You are better off taking the extra time to travel to Tempe Camera!!!\n\nI will say this, Lauren, the manager, was very polite and nice... Other than that, I would not recommend coming to Wilson Camera!!!!"
1,"We had a party of 6 people and arrived at 530 for our 530 reservations.  We were sat at 545 and ordered drinks, salads and our entrees right away, we had a concert at 8. We received our salads at 715.... No joke here. We were served our entrees at 8 pm. We understand places get busy and hectic but our server for the most part avoided our table. We were told once our salads should be coming out soon and that was around 7 pm. Food was ok but for 700.00 dinner and an automatic 22% tip on top of that I would unfortunately not recommend this place. Mastros City hall is awesome!!! Spend your money there, they may not have the view but the svc and food is impeccable."
1,Tourist trap!!! The mix you see swirling around behind the bar has no booze in it and by the time they mix it in a big ass plastic cup with one shot you basically get a watered down fruity smoothy. If you want to get plastered then go to fat tuesday they do the extra shots for $1 and are much more into the party scene. There is a reason Numb works with just 1 bartender (locals know they are a rip off). The only plus side is you can ask for there drink 'virgin' and give them to the kids to walk around with in the vegas style cup.
1,"I went because I got free buffet tickets with my stay. The first time, I tried dinner. Bland food, very few choices. The second time, I went to breakfast. The butter they had near the pancakes was a huge mistake. I probably could have had a decent pancake if I hadn't put that butter on it. The eggs were off for some reason. I am a foodie, so I know what scrambled eggs are supposed to taste like. These eggs were weird tasting. Maybe they were powdered eggs or something. The bacon was excellent. I eventually settled on a salad (never had a salad bar at breakfast but I am glad it was there) and a croissant. The convenience of not having to leave the hotel just wasn't worth it."
1,"Loved the movie... Was expecting something similar, great music, great story of love prevailing through tragedy, exploitation & disappointment, and where fame gave way to a life of meaning & purpose. Instead somebody decided \""hey lets just ruin a great story line with crass and cheap sexual innuendo from beginning to end!\"" \nIt was seriously CRAP! I felt sorry for the actors and singers who were outstandingly talented. The singing and dancing was exceptional and with better directing could actually make it a hit show. But all the 'high school teenage boy' penis & sex jokes? Puh-lease!!!'\nSo disappointed. I can't believe that you can take some of the best Rock songs of all time and completely ruin them with a crap story line! But Rock of Ages at the Venetian managed to do it with panache!"
1,I recently read that the Pin Up Shows contract was extended another year.  What is Statosphere thinking.  All I can say is...someone must be paying Statosphere to run this terrible show....do Not waste your time or money.
1,"Last visit ever. Never going back. If I could leave no stars, I would. Don't bother. Took over an hour for a half a$$ job."
1,"Sigh. I have to update my review because after we finished our meal, we saw a cockroach crawling on the wall. I was absolutely disgusted, and I sadly will not be returning. I just can't get over the roach on the wall. WHAT IF THERE WAS A ROACH IN THE FOOD?!"
1,"Poor service, bad food and cheap setup. By the way price is no cheap. I wish I'd gone to Waynn and paid 10 dollars more for the dinner. I should have taken pic of the deserts to show what I mean... Filthiest desert I've ever seen, didn't even bother to try."
1,"(at The Quad formerly known as the Imperial Palace) Parking is at the rear in one of those famous Vegas Labyrinths except it looks abandoned, dirty and unsafe, park in Valet. \n\nThe waiting staff was prompt and courteous, restaurant has seen a lot of action but still clean, just a little beat up.\n\nI started with the BLT Bloody Mary , the Bacon was good.....I left half my drink , there was something tangy missing in the drink it was just your basic mix with Tabasco....\n\nFor lunch I ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, It was this towering plate with massive pieces of food, the Honeydew melon slice on it was delicious, the chicken breast was dry, it had scrambled egg on top of the fried chicken which was decent and sharp cheddar cheese on top of that.....The cheese tasted burnt with an aftertaste , all that was on top of a layer of mashed potatoes which were decent in taste, there was also some slices of tomato and spinach leaves....I left most of the food not because it was too much but because it did not taste great as the legend says. The melon was great though.\n\nI believe this is a place to fix a hungover  than just a place to go have lunch just because, I do try everything twice just in case the first time sucks so in the future I will go to another location and give it another chance."
1,"One of the worst experiences I have ever had at a brewery or winery. Sat down at a table for 3 in the bar area. 3pm on 12/26. Half-empty. After 7 minutes and not being helped, despite 3 servers + a bartender, I walked to the bar and asked the bartender if we could order from him or if someone was coming to the table. He said someone would be there in a minute. 5 minutes later, timed btw, not one person came up to us, yet checked on various tables to see if people who already had placed orders or had food were ok. The bartender knew we were waiting, saw multiple servers come up to the bar, and said nothing. Sorry, but 12 minutes to wait for sometime to come by a table for a couple of beers is absolutely ridiculous. As we walked out, we passed one of the servers who didn't even acknowledge us, even though she had seen us waiting there. This place should be ashamed of its unbelievably poor customer service. Truly appalling. Have a great beer somewhere at the strip and skip this brewery."
1,"I came here because I wanted to get a manicure, I like to get gel nails. \nAs soon as I entered I was welcomed by the owners, I asked them if they do gel nails and they told me that yes, then I double checked: do you do gel nails? UV gel nails? They confirmed.\nI sat and a woman started working on my natural nails to prepared them, then she took a little jar with powder and I told her, I don want acrylic nails. I want gel nails, the whole nails made of gel. She told me that that powder was the gel.\nC'MON!!!!! \nI told her that when I got my nails done in CA the technician didn't use a powder, so she realized that I knew what I was talking about and told me the truth, that she does acrylic first and gel on top... since I was already in \""manicure-mood\"" I accepted to continue with the acrylics... \nWhen she finished doing my acrylics she painted them with a color of my choice, and then added a coat o shine. NOT GEL!\nshe made me put my hands into the UV lamp to continue trying to trick me.\nAt the end I was so P.O. that I just wanted to get out of that place. (she made me a \""discount\"" over the price of a full set of acrylics) \n\nSo this is a very affordable place to get your acrylics, unfortunately I didn't want acrylics and I didn't want to be treated as a fool."
1,Worst location. Terrible service! I've been to this location twice and they have no clue what they are doing. I ordered a plain cheeseburger and they gave me a hamburger. They gave no condiments at all. Last time I came here I waited 25 minutes in my car before finally going inside and getting a refund. CLEAN It Up Culver's or you'll have seen the last of me. I don't care if your foods good or not.
1,"I'm sad to write this review based on the staff but due to the rude doormen, my whole mood was ruined and I sat down at the bar but started getting angry the more I thought about it and then left without even ordering. Just a tip, don't insult people before they even walk through your doors. That is NOT the way to treat someone willing to give you their money. \nThe decor was super cute and the menu looked interesting. If I'm ever in the neighborhood, I may reconsider trying this place but rude people really put me off."
1,"I am only giving 1 star due to the terrible service. There is one woman that works there in particular that is very unpleasant. No smiles. I had a return, within the given # of days, but she almost seemed personally offedned that I was returning it and was very short throughout the transaction... \n\nI love the merchandise and have purchased some great mosaic tile pots. I like the eclectic mix of items and will go back but will not expect good customer service."
1,All about money that's all you need to know and hopefully is self explanatory to\nAnyone thinking about going here and I would rethink it very seriously.
1,"Wow, this place has gone downhill fast. It used to be my go to late night restaurant. Not any more.\n\nFried rice tasted stale, and the chicken tasted odd."
1,"This is really sad, as Osaka used to be relatively good.  Here, specifically are my issues from my visit last night:\n\n1.  WAY too expensive for what you receive.\n2.  Quality of fish is near rock bottom.  Toro at market price ($24) was not fatty, nor do I suspect, tuna.\n3. Tako was just chewy rubber\n4.  It took forever to get a carryout order.  45 minutes to be exact.\n\nSushi Wa is MUCH better.  I think I was spoiled by Yoshida's in San Marino, CA.  Definitely the best"
1,"Currently sitting here in Mint writing this review.  We organized a group to come and try the inferno challenge.  We arrived at 2pm so the non challengers could have the buffet and when the dinner menu started at 3pm the challenge could take place.  On arrival we told the staff our plans.  40 mins after arrival they inform us they don't have the ingredients for the challenge.  So wasted trip for us.  No retribution offered, just told to call them in a week to see if they have it again ."
1,"HORRIBLE. Made a reservation but still had to wait close to 45 min. The place smelled TERRIBLE, like a rotten incense, it was over whelming. It so was bad that the staff apologized, comped our meal, and gave us cab fair back!!! Food was ok. \n\nIt might have been an off day for Musashi, but I just can't recomend them to anyone. \n\nYolies & Firefly are in the same parking lot and they are both excellent!! Go there instead."
1,"Fazoli's has somehow managed to screw up a breadstick, which I thought a task impossible. I took a bite and instead of Italian goodness, I was smacked in the mouth with buttered popcorn flavor. Or maybe more accurately, a buttered popcorn flavor Jelly Belly. What is this?\n\nWhen I arrived, nobody was at the counter. For a long time. I perused the menu for a quite some time before anyone came to take my order. Then, the staff was extra loud in talking to the people behind me: their friends, not customers. \n\nI had had a pretty traumatic day and just wanted some damn pasta to make myself feel better but this place, believe it or not, actually made me feel worse.\n\nAlso how hilarious is it that a piece of pizza is considered a \""side\"" here? Yep, load me up with pasta and then instead of a normal person side, I would like some more cheese and grease."
1,"This place completely blows.  If this is the best bagel in Montreal - I'd rather have Lender's frozen bagels in a heartbeat.  There is no debate.  New York bagels completely obliterate this sham of a place. I cannot believe there are positive reviews on this page.  St-Viatuer Bagels are horrible.  Let me count the ways.  They taste like complete cardboard. The sandwiches are \""pre-made\"" - meaning, all of your toppings are just sitting there (turkey, cheese) all day - rather than being cut fresh.  i went there with high hopes with this being the \""18th\"" ranked restaurant in Montreal.  What s joke.  Again, the bagels suck.  Absolutely no taste.  None.\n\nSo, in sum....  RUN, don't walk away.  It is a complete waste of your money for this tasteless, stale imitator with rancid, tasteless toppings.  \n\nAVOID!!!!!"
1,Chicken Caesar Salad: hardly any dressing and a complete lack of flavor.  The chicken was a reheated slab of frozen chicken with soggy breading. You can save yourself the time and get a salad from McDonald's that's probably better.
1,"This review is for the LATE NIGHT eater. We headed here specifically because it advertised a late night menu - which is limited for those seeking good food after a late night out in Vegas. THIS is not the place to go. I can't say if the food quality is better during the day - I hope so, since I've seen this location brimming with patrons during regular hours. However, I can say that the quality of food was below any food expectations anyone can have when we visited. Everything from the apps, pizza and Caesar salad felt like it was either reheated from a pre prepared version in the kitchen or put together with the lowest of standards. I can only hope that the lack of taste and presentation is due to the restaurant's assumption that patrons at 4 am are either too drunk or too desperate to care about good food. The only reason I even give this a 1 star is because our waiter was nice, helpful and accommodating to our needs. He - not the food - get the star."
1,"What should have been a one hour dining experience at most ended up being a two and a half hour nightmare. Calamari was burnt breadcrumbs and some actual calamari. Food was good quality but horrible tasting. Not to mention the fact that it took an hour and a half to order and cook, only to be served cold. After sending it back, we received it hot after two hours of waiting. We had a show to catch so we asked for to go boxes. The food was taken to the back.... And promptly thrown away. Management apologized and took half off the check and offered to go dessert. Dessert was ice cream. I would NEVER recommend or return, which is unfortunate to the rest of the great food locations in DTLV."
1,"Soooo disappointed!! \n\nI stayed 2 nights at the belle suite for my bachlorette and it was a bad experience from day one. I don't even know where to start... \n\n1. The service was horrible!! It took them almost 1 1/2 hours to bring us fresh towels and 35 minutes for more toilet paper, not to mention they only brought one roll for a group of people in a suite!!!! I had to go find a cleaning lady because it took to damn long. \n\n2. Rude! Rude! Rude Security! My friend forgot her room key and she asked if he could page someone to let her up and he said \""don't you see I'm dealing with more important stuff\"", as if the other guest was more important than her. \n\n3. We had noooo signal for Internet at all and no phone service at all either \n\n4. Our room keys kept getting inactivated so we had to walk EVERYTIME downstairs for replacement keys\n\n5. There was a puddle of water on the floor which made me almost fall!\n\n6. We checked out at 10:50 and asked for bell hop and he arrived at 11:45! I understand they are busy but really almost an hour for a bellhop!?\n\nI would have rather stayed at a motel 6 because I feel that it is the type of service I paid for. I will never stay there again. Beautiful interior but even the room didn't seem worth the price. I paid too much for a horrible hotel experience."
1,"Absolutely horrible.\n\nIn no particular order - \n\n- waited for 40 minutes for salads while restaurant was very slow\n- wedge salad was a chopped salad\n- waiter filled wine glass to rim and did not offer a tasting prior\n- signature 3 finger pork chop was very bland for 48 hours of marinating\n- signature prime rib was gray and very bland\n- service was extremely slow and impersonal\n\nBased on their website you'd believe you are going to a 4 star restaurant to \""indulge\"" - don't be fooled.\n\nI'd suggest one of the other chain restaurants by Concord Mills."
1,"I had the ribs at 11:00.  They looked nothing like the picture.  Were average at best.\n\nWorst than that was the service.  I sat for 10 minutes before the waitress ever came for a drink order.  Then, after she brought the food, she never came back until 10 minutes later.... to drop off the bill.  Didn't ask if I need anything else.   Didn't even come back to collect.  \n\nThe place is a dump, too."
1,"OK, so I had become somewhat of a regular at the 61B and was really enjoying the convenience of a local coffee shop again.  However, my most recent experience wipes away my last glowing review.   Their WIFI never works for me..seriously never ever on any of my devices.  I don't own antiquated technology and use WIFI at a myriad of other places, so it perplexes me why it just doesn't seem to work for me at the 61B. Normally I have my 4G hotspot with me, so no big deal when I can't connect.  \n\nBut this morning I was there sans hotspot and tried to connect to the 61B WIFI... again nothing worked. I was basically told the issue was with my device, so I left and wont be going back.  If you're going to offer WIFI as a way to entice patrons I think it should work, no?  Also, perhaps being a bit more sympathetic/apologetic about its shortcoming would be advantageous.  It felt like an incredible waste of time to pack my things to do some work and then not be able to connect to (what seemd like) able bodied internet.  Boo! Pretty disappointed that I need to step away from this establishment, at least I'll save a few bucks and calories!"
1,Was strongly thinking about getting a membership here being that it is very close to my house. I have been a golds member in the past. was really not all that impressed with the facility. the customer service was terrible i honestly felt like i was buying a used car! I think im gonna save the money and work out for free at Nellis AFB and just make the drive over there instead.
1,Very dirty and disgusting. Sat down and he brought out egg noodles and duck sauce. Long black hair right on top. Got up and walked out.
1,Worst chain of restaurants in AZ. Go buy a Budget Gourmet tv dinner...heat it up and that's how Applebee's tastes. Rumor has it that they actually do use a microwave for most of their dishes. Pasta Alfredo is one of them. Just plain gross. The only reason I would go here is for their cheap happy hour for the drinks.
1,"How can they call this fish n chips without malt vinegar!  No hot sauce!  Wha!? Shrimp was 90% batter. Instead of fish, fish patties.  Someone please explain to me how so many are eating here. I can truly appreciate my own fish n chips place back at home."
1,"I was bummed once I grabbed my plate and could see how small the buffet area really was. From the front it looked nice inside and it looked like everyone was enjoying their food. After standing in a slow line and paying $15 for a bottle of champagne with my brunch, we explored the buffet. The food was less then average, similar to a local buffet for 7.99 in my home town. Most of us tried to find something we liked and ended up staying with safe food choices like toast and mac n cheese. Just go elsewhere and pay roughly the same for much better food."
1,"My brother in law and I stopped here for dinner after overshooting our turn for another sushi place. Walking in the door, nice ambiance. Sat at the bar and ordered the all you can eat in which the customer is timed at 45 mins to eat. Dinner started off bad because I ordered a roll and the sushi chef drowned it in a sweet sauce. And when I say drowned, the bottom of the plate showed no white. I told the sushi guy that I didn't want the roll because he drowned it in sweet sauce. He accused me putting too much soy sauce. Really!? My meal was ruined, I ate the most basic califorrnia and philly rolls, had my plum icecream and peaced the place out. Truly, truly disappointed. Not to mention, the fish was not well kept."
1,"We went on a Sunday night 1-15-2012 for my wifes birthday and I will not likely go back.  I had been there twice for lunch and it wasn't bad, however my experience last night was horrible.  Most everything I tasted was bland and no egg foo young.  What chinese food buffet doesn't have that item as a staple food on their menu.  Won Ton soup, with only liquid in the pot, nothing else.  As I said before, the food was mostly pretty bland and even the hot and spicy dishes were not very spicy at all.  Too top it off, not looking at the prices before I sat down, two meals and one ice tea, $28.08 which was ridiculous for the quality of food we ate.  Taco Bell or Subway would have been a much better choice, or Lin's which has never been disappointing.  NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Casadee complains about having stripper clients and coworkers yet she does hair in las vegas, laughable.  Also since she's only an assistant a stylist she should be grateful for the clients she does have instead of insulting them right to their face.. once when she did my hair she was saying someone was tall and thin what more can a girl want.. well I was in her chair and im short and curvy and I happen to like my body I'm glad I don't have a 12 year old boy body and I'd be skeptical of any man who did like those type of bodies. She's just an immature assistant I don't know how her extensions are but her cut and color is ok not worth going back. This salon gets 1 star in my book because they employed such a rude girl."
1,Have had pedicures here before but they keep getting progressively worse. This time water was so hot ended up with first - degree burns. Woman was also very rough in handling feet.
1,"Our first time to this place was not memorable at all. We walked in and wondered about with no hostess paying any attention. Finally I asked her, if we can sit in the bar. She waived us which direction to go, no offering take us there, or offering menus. We sat at the bar table for about 15 minutes and at least ten waiters, bus boys passed by us without any acknowledgement. So, we got up and walked out. Again, hostess did not say a word. It was not a busy night and that makes it even worse. We are not going back to Jonny Fox's again!"
1,UGH! Typical diner and not in a good way. The problem with this place is that it's never the same. If Costco has bacon on sale she's buying it from Costco. If Restaurant Depot has it on sale she's driving all the way down there. Biscuits Cafe is so good because it's ALWAYS the same. This lady just buys the cheapest and it shows!!! I won't be back!
1,"Don't waste your time. Go to outback steakhouse instead. At least your meats will be cooked properly and seasoned there.  Even if you have to walk, go to Texas De Brazil instead."
1,"I had a cheese burger here last night. The patty tasted as if it had been heated more than once and possibly had a visit with the microwave, no flavor and chewy.  The service was great and the food came out fast (yay, for microwaves!) but I will never return."
1,"Palms poker room has been closed. It was closed last week. No tables, nothing. The employee I talked to sounded surprised.\n\nI was somewhat surprised, but I guess the hotel is under a new general manager and they feel like they can make more money with a different product."
1,"Two groups decided to go get a bite to eat since this was a Food Network must in Las Vegas. One group of four ordered three entrees. The other group of six ordered 6 entrees. We all ordered tacos. All came out one at a time increments of two to 10 minutes. Food wasn't to die for. I did like the Bombay taco. Don't get the refried beans. Horrible! Service was horrible and it wasn't busy. I would be scared to come here when college was in session. You would be waiting for hours! I don't think I will go back. One good thing, it was interesting venue."
1,"I brough my car for service to this location , and waited for 15 minutes no one adknowledged me ! Service is very slow!   No very friendly customer service at all! When my service contract expires i will never comeback here!"
1,"If I could give this hotel negative stars I would. Keep in mind, I did not stay at the IP expecting the Wynn. I knew this was not a first class establishment, but the location and price were too tempting.\n\nFirst off, we could not find the parking structure for a good half hour. The construction is awful and there is no proper signage to designate where guests should go to park. Literally drove in circles.\n\nUpon finally making it to our room, we attempted to open the room door but were stopped by a pile of DIRTY towels. Probably a good 50-60 towels sitting in the hallway of our room. I called the front desk and they said to come down and they would give us an \""upgrade.\"" Apparently the \""upgrade\"" was the exact same room two floors higher. We had a view of the strip which we didn't realize meant listening to the Carnival Bar blaring music until they closed. Of course, I was not in my room all night, but I had a friend who had to go back early sick and she was unable to sleep. \n\nWe left the next morning and paid way too much for another hotel. I know you get what you pay for, but I don't think you could pay me to stay at the Imperial again."
1,"Three problems:\n1.  Can I get a fork?  I know I'm not supposed to, but I don't have the patience to eat the whole meal with chop sticks I can barely use at my desk.\n2.  I only ordered two things, and both were supposed to be hot.  Neither were.  \n3. My one roll was all squishied in this little tupperware container with the ginger and wasabi.   I had to grab the wasabi with my napkin so I didn't have to use the one set of chopsticks (granted I did not mention to leave out the stuff, but still).  Plus, squishied roll.  This was all while the dumpling things I ordered were kickin' it in style in the cute little aluminium thing with plenty of room.  \n\nI'm disappointed to say the least."
1,I was unable to get ahold of them on a prepaid voucher. What a tragic example of the American small business! Shame on you Maid Affordable for having such poor business practices!!
1,"When I was a kid, I loved going to hometown buffet at least back then the food was awesome! last year, my mom and i went there the food was great. we went there yesterday evening for a late bday for her and the food was freakin nasty! something i ate made me go to the bathroom almost twice!\n\ni noticed the seating was very low not that many customers. the bathroom (womens) was horrible! there is one lady who looks new is super friendly with long hair in a ponytail. she goes above and beyond not so much the other staff will do that. i don't know what is going on with hometown buffet but it looks like they don't care. i agree with someone on here said the cooking speaks otherwise!\n\ni couldn't finish my 2nd plate of food it was that bad the only thing was good is the dessert. i hate to say this but i would rather not go to hometown buffet anymore.  i dont know why my mom chooses to go there (oh wait its cheap) but there are better restaurants.\n\nin 96 or 97, my parents had their sphagetti and it made them sick! the food didn't do anything to me. i told my mom why go back when it made you sick? makes no sense to me."
1,"Stay away!  Many billing issues - front office is not customer helpful.  You must keep track of your own balances and insurance.  They will not help.  I was even billed for services they never did, but even with copies of my walk out statements as proof, they state they can bill per the estimates and do not have to prove they did the work via the walk out statements."
1,"I hated this place from the moment I stepped onto the patio and had my first encounter with the rude security people.  There wasn't enough seating maybe just two small tables outside on patio.  When you enter the building its tiny inside with very little seating as well and too much space is used up for walking space.  The layout is just poorly done.  Walked up to the bar to order a drink and waited patiently for quite sometime before the bar tender came over and helped a rude drunk that pushed his way up right next to me well almost on top of me.  I literally had to push the drink guy off of me and tell him to chill out.  I pushed him off of me several times.  The bar tender was beyond rude catering to the drunk man saying hey listen we are all here to have fun but that was directed at me the sober lady that had been waiting patiently for someone to take my order.  The dumb bar tender should have asked if he could help me but of course he was too stupid to do that and the drunk was argumentative and apologetic you know an annoying apologetic drunk.  It was awesome.  The place totally sucks.  My husband and I both said that the whole vibe was a bad one, the seating sucked, the building sucks, and the employees were negative and rude.  Would never go back."
1,"Waiting a looooooooong time for the holiday meal was the terrible experience at Christmas night, and the food was not as good as expected!"
1,"Please, please don't use them. I just called on Oct. 6th because I have termite tunnels in our bedroom over our bed. I got an Oct. 30th appt. I just sent in the $99 renewal fee for their contract. I need to call Chase and cancel the check. They have never gotten rid of our termite problem. It seems they just chase them from one room to another. I told the receptionist I would find another company to come out quicker and would be calling back to cancel the contract. She gave me a very polite \""fine\"". Seems they don't need our business."
1,Since the new owners took over they things have gone downhill fast.  They deleted coupons.  They stopped having sales.  Half the people who worked there are gone.  Prices are way up.  You can do better.
1,"Talk about disappointment.  And regret.  We were told by one of our guys that Caesar's had a great buffet, and who were we to argue?  It's still one of the nicer resorts on the strip.  We got there Memorial Day morning, and while we weren't surprised that we got charged the weekend prices, it was a bit weird that it was next to empty.\n\nWe found out why.  You don't get nearly what you pay for to come here.  The selection really comes down to the omelet station, prime rib, shrimp cocktails, and sushi.  There wasn't much variety in the foods, and they didn't re-supply quickly enough (there was a point where was no fresh fruit to be found at all!)  Also, even though someone said that quality beats out quantity, it sure sucks when you have to wait in line to get food.  And really, it's not that much better than other places.\n\nOn its own it's passable, but with so many better options around for the same price, it's really not worth it to go."
1,Came back yesterday for my oil change and I got to say this place has changed. I asked for Carlos or Chris and this guy named Mario laughed and said their no longer here. I asked where they get transfered to and laughed again said no longer with company so I continued with service. Tell me why he kept shaking the yes shake his head while he was trying sell me stuff I didn't need I took care of last visit plus his eyes were so blood shot red and so was another employee looked like they were high off narcotics. Very unprofessional they should randomly drug test their employees because it seems they are under influence of something. Sad see carlos or chris are no longer with company best service advisor I had wish they would bring him back clean up that store maybe they I will  return as loyal customer
1,We were ignored for 20 minutes after arriving at our table. Normally I wouldn't be so bothered when I have good conversation at the table but the fact that tables that were seated after us were having their drink orders taken and delivered before I had even seen my waiter was irritating. I had to go find a waitress a total of three times before the hostess decided to just come and take our order herself. Our food came out about fifteen minutes later and our drinks finally came out an additional 10 after that (sadly I actually kept track). No one ever came to refill any of our drinks. The only thing that made me feel a little better is that I wasn't the only one who  was receiving this type of service. Three other tables also had to either get up and find someone to take their orders or find someone to print out their checks because they weren't being attended to. Maybe this was just a bad night for Noodle Asia but as far as I'm concerned with horrible service and mediocre food I don't think I will ever return. \n\nNooooo Thanks. I'll get my noodles somewhere else.
1,"I loved Canteen so much better than this place. During the DAY and at NIGHT-this place is obnoxious. The service was horrible, the staff was rude and stuck up. I didn't have the best time here at all. My friend and I waited at the outside bar patio during regular business hours....20 minutes went by and the bartender didn't even acknowledge us. He was too busy talking to his buddies at the other side of the bar. We walked out of that place so fast, but before we left we made sure to talk to the hostess about our issue. I, nor my friend will be returning here.\nThey did however have good music and the restaurant and bathroom were clean!"
1,"Well since the two best left I am not certain that it will ever live up to the salon it once was.  If you too were Michael and Jill fanatics you can find them below (GHH refused to tell me where he was).  \n\n\nCanyon Falls Spa and Salon\n7131 W Craig Rd \nLas Vegas, NV. 89129\n702-491-6434 ---To make an appointment with Nicole(yes the same sweet Nicole who always made appointments!)"
1,No good. Nothing to say. Bland or too salty. No taste beyond that. I would only recommend this place if you are extrememly broke and only for midnight to 7am ($2.95).
1,"This place sucks A$$!!  Service sucks, management, and  atmosphere!!  See ya, were staying clear of here. Rather go eat the buffet at Green valley ranch!!"
1,"Went here on a Friday just missed breakfast. Ended at 11 we got seated at about 11:15am. Took a min to get water waitress mention something about they just washed the glasses it'll be a sec(no problem). Starters we got nachos maybe took about 40mins to get, we loved them ok that was good. We were done with that and about 15mins. Our food didn't come until 12:18 we waited a whole hour. People at the bar just were seated already eating before we even got our food. I had the Caesar salad, I don't understand why the lettuces didn't come chopped it's whole lettuces on the plate, didn't enjoy the veggies were cut very big. My boyfriend had the steak tacos, he said it taste like nothing, he had one taco n felt stupid eating something without flavor so stopped. I'm not sure if it took a while to get out food because it was just sitting there because the nachos were hot nor cold. Nor was the tacos. Even tho the nacho were good would never eat here again."
1,"Worst meal ever. \n\nI was in town visiting my parents over the winter holiday and we stopped in for dinner here. Service was horrible. My parents are older so we went in early (around 5pm). Most of the staff looked hung-over and treated us as though they hadn't clocked in yet. I thought it best to play it safe and ordered the chicken taco's. They were flavorless for the most part, but with an overpowering cilantro aftertaste that didn't balance. I had a bite of my father's fish - which was okay, but by no means anything more than standard fare. Their entire menu lacked imagination and I begrudgingly sat through the meal hoping to leave soon. About 24 hours later (on Christmas Eve) I came down with a wrenching case of salmonella poisoning. My mother (who had a bite of my chicken taco) followed shortly after and it was a Christmas filled with memories of vomiting and diarrhea. So much so, we didn't get around to opening any presents until just before I left for my flight home.\n\nWhen I did arrive home I weighed myself at ten pounds lighter (if that gives you a sense of volume) and determined never to be shy about sending food back."
1,"My initial thought was..... \""15 dollars for two pizzas, can't beat that!\"" \nCome to find out my 6 year old daughter just had this with her father the weekend before we did. \nShe was so sick from it she threw up. I asked her about the last time she ate it along with her dad and both confirmed she had been sick the first time as well. \n\nDon't bother if you have children. If not don't bother unless you have an iron stomach or need to loose 5 lbs."
1,"EXTREMELY disappointed with this CPK. I used to love the chicken ceaser sandwich. Even though they discontinued the sandwich I called in to see if they could still make it on different bread. When I called in, the lady that picked up said they could make it on a ciabatta bread. I then drove 15 minuets to enjoy this meal, and when I got there they proceed to tell me that there is no way that they could make the sandwich. NEVER GOING BACK"
1,"Where have all the good Chinese restaurants gone? I recently moved to this side of town and decided that I would try it out. \n\nI got the vegetable lo mein, easy enough, nothing that should be messed up in a Chinese place. I called ahead and it was all ready when I came to pick it up 15 minutes later. The lady was nice but I guess decided to jack up the price $2 from the menu. I didn't say anything, but actions spoke louder than words and I left no tip. The restaurant is FILLED with cans of food all over, so obviously nothing is fresh. Gross. \n\nI decided to not let the experience at the restaurant ruin it for me so I went home with an open mind, hoping to find a treasure. Well all I found was junk. The noodles were slimy and had a weird thick gooey sauce (from a can) smothered all over it. My one piece of broccoli could hardly mark it as a vegetable dish, so they added a pound of cabbage. I don't mind cabbage but that is not what I ordered and it is a very cheap substitute for a plate full of real veggies. \n\nI will never be going back. I will though continue my search for good food in Henderson! Wish me luck..."
1,"Never again!  I had two margaritas.  The first was a banana margarita that had no flavor.  The second was a coconut margarita that had three live, decorative ants.  Of course, I did not drink it.  The chilaquiles were made with tortilla strips!!!  Worst of all, the food was nearly flavorless.  The restaurant itself is decorated nicely and the staff are friendly.  After confirming the ants in my drink, management comped my meal.  Never again will I set foot on this place."
1,What???! They have items that are not for sale..... The clothing on the mannequins are not for sale..... This place is so gross.
1,"Blech!!! Unfortunately ate here twice while staying at Luxor for a conference. The worst buffet in Vegas!! Everything tastes like it was frozen then defrosted and plopped into serving dishes!! Yuck.....lunch offerings were dry and over cooked pork loin, fried chicken  and beef stroganoff. Both my husband an I hated everything that was sampled.....EVEN dessert!! How do you mess up dessert!!!! Well ask Luxor cause they seem to have it down! Sundays champagne brunch was better....only because with all the alcohol everything tastes better!"
1,"This place was awful!  My husband ordered the crab cakes - they were fishy and tasted like they were from a can,  I had the fried catfish.  It was fair - coating was just cornmeal.  Very dry and tasteless.  The sides were also bland - coleslaw was the best although very sweet.  Cornbread was good.  Woman behind counter was extremely unfriendly.  When she brought our meals, served in to-go boxes, she just threw then on the table.   Meals are pricey.   We had a deal chicken and will never return."
1,"Do not stay here if you like clean, quiet place to sleep.\n\nWork insisted I stay here. Arrived to find out if you want to check in before 3 pm, you have to pay an additional $16.80. Before noon.. you pay $25.\n\nRoom carpet is dirty, has loose threads, debris left from not being vacuumed properly.\n\nBed throws were covered with long straight gray hair. When I called housekeeping I was told they do not replace the throws with each guest because they assume they are not used. \n\nFurniture blocking all electrical outlets, could not reach to plug in my electrical medical devices. They solution? Call housekeeping and we will send someone up to move furniture. No.. they would not take it from room, so it is now crowded. They offered to have someone come up to plug in things when I need it. \n\nEntertainment center has lots of wear and tear.. .laneer is peeling off. \nWallpaper is peeling.\nDrapes are falling off of tracks.\n\nthe only thing nice so far is the bathroom.\n\nAsked manager if they had newer room and was told, no. we can move to you another room, it may or may not be cleaner... you will have same issue with wall plugs.\n\nNext time.. I go to a different hotel. i travel to Vegas for business at least 2-3 times a year.. will NOT be back here."
1,"It took three trips to Autozone to get my battery replaced that was under warranty. I even brought the print out from my mechanic's machine that stated the battery was bad. Michael, the manager, told me, \""I have been an ASE certified mechanic for 35 years and I know this is a good battery\"". He then told me I should have done a parasitic diagnostic test on the car to see what the problem was. However, I explained to him my mechanic had hooked my car up TWICE and each time it had diagnosed the problem to a bad battery.\n\nHe finally tested the battery again, and this time his machine showed it was a bad battery.\n\nI will not go to this Autozone again. Horrible customer service."
1,"Awful service.  Despite the restaurant being half empty we were put on a wait because our party of 5 was too big to sit.  They continued to seat 3 parties of 2, before I went to ask how long the wait would be.  I was told awhile.  Servers had time to sit and talk but couldn't possibly be bothered to help us.  We left and enjoyed the Kona Grill for lunch."
1,This hotel has truly gone down hill. We checked in.. which was fine.. when we got to our room the door was already  unlocked. Come to find out the door doesnt need a key at all you can just open it because  it never locked. I actually got one of the housekeepers to see if this was suppose to happen or if there was some trick to keep it locked. She confirmed that it wasnt suppose  to do that... so called front desk to tell them we needed a new room and one that locked. It took them a good minute to fix the issue. It was a sunday night and  the lobby was dead so it wasnt like they were busy. When getting into our second room we had a half full drink in the refrigerator.. that made us feel like cleaning clearly doesnt happen. I understand that they're other people using the room before us.. but man can you make sure i dont have to clean their mess.. thats a little  nasty to me. I called the front desk again and they put the blame in the ventor people.  Hmmmmm so its there fault that you keep low cleaning standards. Such an inconvenience coming here and not having  the level of service you expect. I felt like i was staying at the holiday inn.
1,I will rate it one star because I ordered a box on a Thursday night it got here in 45 mins that was a good thing the only problem I have with them is that when receive the pizza it was cold and the pasta was barely room temp.  warm and when I called to speak with the manager I was on hold for 16 mins and when he answers the phone I started to speak and asking him questions as soon I start telling about the pizza he couldn't hear me anymore idk what's wrong with them and playing these games
1,"I used Keller and JADD management for about a year to rent my apartment and I was not impressed.  I was constantly speaking to a new employee and nobody who I'd spoken to about matters previously still worked there. I am not sure why the have such I high turnover rate but it leads to serious management and liability issues.  Nobody has a clue what the last (absentee) employee did or said.   The cherry on top is when I took over managing my unit last month,  I found my unit in disrepair with numerous damages!  I spent a few thousand dollars repairing the walls, paint, carpeting, tile, two doors, and a new garbage disposal.  The deposits had all been returned and no notes or mention of the damages had ever been brought to my attention!   If you value your investment I recommend finding a quality management firm.        WHY IS MY REVIEW NOT RECOMMENDED !!!"
1,Just ate here. The lengua tacos are waaaaay over cooked. They were mush on the plate full of grease. \n\nThe chicken enchiladas are very dry and soaked with their green sauce which kills the dish. \n\nI don't recommend coming here if you want Mexican. Food.
1,"Okay, Let me just say....I'm not sure if it was food poisoning, or I coincidentally came down with a stomach bug 4 hours after eating their pizza.....but after my 36 hour adventure with my toilet and the bathroom floor, I can't say I'm willing to give this place another shot....not to mention the pizza really wasn't even worth my misery.\n\nSo, the pizza itself. I got the spinach trio (comes with spinach, tomato and feta cheese). It was a thin crust pizza, and there was waaaaaayyyyyyy too much mozzarella on this thing. The cheese was at least 1/4 inch think. This wouldn't be a problem it it was on an appropriate thickness crust. The poor thin crust just couldn't hold up all that cheese and was floppy and soggy. The was also a strange smokey flavor to the pizza, which I just don't get. Plus, there was hardly any spinach at all on the pizza. \n\nOn the plus side, the girl working the counter was very peppy and nice. \n\nSo, if your going to try this place, I recommend skipping the spinach trio...maybe it was the feta that poisoned me.....good luck, I hope you have a better experience that I....if you're the brave type."
1,"Not worth it!  The food is below average, service is bad, the place is not anything special.  I would not go back.  There are too many great places on the strip to go to waste your time on this rinky dink establishment.  The drinks are pathetic.  Waited for refills.  My husband had to wait for a new pot of coffee which took 10 minutes.  The extra staff who gets water etc is a joke.  Unfortunately I have no choice to give 1 star.  This place is a big 0!"
1,"I always thought 1-star reviews on Yelp were written by bitter, resentful people who had nothing better to do than just complain. But now I feel their pain. It really doesn't hit you, until it... hits you.\n\nYou pay a premium at WF, you expect a premium, right? Well parking is part of the shopping experience. It's why they have parking lots in the first place. But never mind the atrocious parking lot and not being able to easily maneuver in it.\n\nI'm talking about being TOWED. Towed, not for leaving the parking lot, but for legitimately shopping at WF. Yes, this could happen to you too.\n\nUpon contacting the towing company, they demanded $135 (cash only) to return my vehicle. Upon contacting WF (since I was a legitimate shopper there and didn't leave the lot) they just shrugged their shoulders and just told me the name of the company that managed the lot.\n\nAnd that's it?! $135 is no chump change, but it seems like WF wants me to carry an extra $135 every time I frequent them (thankfully, never, since I don't live in Pittsburgh). This whole parking/towing situation is extremely shady, but the only company I'm going to point my finger at is Whole Foods for doing business with such a shady complex and passing the burden on to its customers.\n\nTip: Bring an extra $135 to pay for parking, or just go to Trader Joe's/Giant Eagle for a better parking/shopping experience."
1,Watch out for this place. My wife was there last week and was accosted by glass people pulling a classic insurance fraud scam called windshield replacement fraud. (google it or look on the website of the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud)  They hustle waiting car wash customers into getting new windshields they don't need and try to charge it to their insurance company. Obviously this car wash is letting them do this to their customers. Pretty scary . She will NEVER go back there.
1,I got a to go order for a combo of chicken teriyaki and beef teriyaki and it came with a little scoop of rice and the salad was horrible.Only a few little pieces of chicken and beef! It was a total ripoff and guess what?$10.95 for the whole combo!!!! I'm never going there again! Oh and if u want good sushi and stuff go to yummy grill sushi. Man that place is bombing! P.S. not literally.
1,"If you sign up for this TV service, make sure you ask specifically if they run a hard or soft credit inquiry, that way you can dispute it if they tell you a soft and run a hard. Expect no accountability and constant transfers when you have an issue, even when dealing with supervisors. Make sure you cancel any promotional offers when the promotion ends or you will end up paying for the service (ie. premium channels and or NFL Sunday Ticket). \n\nOverall, not happy at all. The downside is that these reviews don't matter. Because of the monopoly that is run by the television and telecommunication industry, they literally do not have to have any accountability at all. Sign of the times I guess..."
1,"This pizza tastes like water. We just ordered a medium Veggie Downtown, which has mushrooms, peppers, onions, and olives. Unfortunately, it doesn't taste like any of those items. You can't taste the sauce or the crust, either. I've never had a more bland pizza in my life. Yes, they're open late and yes, they delivered the pizza quickly. But those are the only nice things I can say about this place. As my partner just put it, he'd rather eat Totino's Party Pizzas. Ouch."
1,Purchased tickets to Kendrick Lamar and tried to pick it up day of in the afternoon at like 1PM and was told they won't let us pick up will call tickets until 10:30PM. My friends and I go there at midnight and try to pick tickets up and the lady tells us that they stop printing out tickets and that the email confirmation says that they stop printing tickets at midnight. \nHow can I not be able to pick up tickets that i bought already?????? That is the worst thing I've ever heard. and I'm sure others had the same problem too.\n\nNot to mention the line was insane and it barely moved. \n\nVery unsatisfied and I'm sure this happened to many others that night. Don't think I will every come here again..
1,I had the California burrito yesterday. And the potato's tasted raw and the meat tasted old and it was black. The only edible part of the burrito was the tortilla. I had a friend taste the burrito and he threw up from it. I was not happy. Not going back.
1,"Went to BWW last night, Saturday Oct 18th, for my hubby's birthday dinner. Our daughter picked the spot and hubby gave the okay due to the great food and amazing experience we had at the BWW off north ln prior. Well...our experience here was CRAP compared to their other location. Will NEVER go back here.\n\nWe had over a 30 min wait to sit, which was explainable for a Saturday night. Once we finally get sat  it takes about 10 mins to get our sodas, which was \""okay\"" since the server did seem busy and took the time to acknowledge that she would be right with us. However the main complaint is once we ordered our food, 2  chicken meals and a burger it took over 45 mins to arrive, granted it was a Saturday it still should NEVER take this long to get food. Once it did arrive hubby's hamburger and fries were COLD, its one thing to wait long for food to come out hot but to come out cold is not okay. Finally the manager comes over and says he understands our frustration and offers to take his UNTOUCHED food off the bill as he takes his plate (um, ya think?) and gives us a 15% discount for the NEXT visit...wow. \n\n Bottom line HORRIBLE customer service here and won't be going back."
1,"The food here is disgusting. I ordered the French dip sandwich and received what may have been boiled pork on a bun. I couldn't tell what the meat was, by taste, to be honest. And it didn't smell appetizing either. I took one bite and spit it out.\nMy waiter offered to get me something else. I ordered a cheeseburger because I figured \""you can't mess those up!\"" Wrong. I have no idea what that meat was, either. Whatever it was, it wasn't cooked properly.\nI ordered cheese fries as the side to my dish, and the cheese atop the fries was burnt to a crisp. Yuck.\nThe most appetizing thing that my husband and I ordered was the spinach and artichoke dip. It was actually pretty good! But my suggestion would be to slice up those artichoke hearts into more user friendly, bite-size pieces."
1,"Worst service I've ever had. Waited for 20 minutes while the only guy working stared at me and wouldnt help me with my questions. Highly unprofessional, he didn't even address my presence or greet me. My advice, go to the pearle vision downstairs I had way better luck with them"
1,"When you walk into a \""Mexican\"" restaurant and ask the waiter, \"" what do you have that is spicy?\"" and he replies with, \""well, we don't really have much spicy food\"" you're in trouble."
1,If there's negative star I would give them a negative 5 stars. The chandler location are crook and they would steal from you. Stay away from them. I was given an estimate for repairs and the final bills turned to be 10 times higher than the estimate. I initially refused to pay them for the bill and finally had to pay it to get the truck to be released. Definitely going to fill with BBB on this. I can't let them get away from this.
1,"Apex is a scam.  we attempted to set up an appointment for over a week, but no one answered, and pathetically, they were too lazy to return a phone call. they finally answered a week later.  we would have already dumped them, but we were stuck with Groupon.  They confirmed the make, model, and service required, and confirmed a price.  When we arrived for our appt, they reneged their offer price and told us it would be an additional $55 to tint a VERY simple moonroof.  unfortunately there's a common thread with companies that have to resort to groupon for business, they are mostly clueless and they cant win customers without giving away discounted services.  Good luck Apex, you'll need lots of it.  Stay AWAY... too many other tint companies to choose from."
1,"Sitting here for too long... The service is not clear- my name is next- however, they take the other guy, do not explain what is happening, I ask and they say he has an appointment... Just effing communicate, speak to you people who are sitting here... Crazy how lame AT&T can be.\nSeriously a breathing moment."
1,Horrible Place!! I wiped everything down with Lysol wipes! I refused to use their towels because I don't think they changed them!
1,"I made an appointment and walked in with my $19.99 coupon for an oil change last Saturday. While Just Brakes siphoned fresh oil from the center of Earth, they had 2.5 hours of free time to take my car apart and hand me a laundry list of things totaling over $1100.00. Dean told me I needed new spark plugs, new shocks, grind the rotors, new brake pads, new windshield wipers, a fuel package to dry out moisture, and some other things I can't remember. When I objected, he reworked the estimate four times and brought it down to just the essential items, which came to more than $500. I had to call my husband, and Dean asked to talk to my husband, and I finally got out of there feeling good about getting a $19.99 oil change for only $66. It was a horrible experience. I will never step foot in there again."
1,"Stopped here recently because I wanted to support Willy Street amid all the construction. The girl behind the counter treated us like we weren't cool enough to be there. I felt like an outsider instead of welcomed, very discouraging when I was trying to patronize a local business in the middle of a tough time for the street as a whole. I definitely will not be going back."
1,"Attempted to order a pizza from here.  Driver apparently delivered it to the wrong address.  Driver then went back without making  any further attempt to contact us .  Calling the store we were told that they would not deliver the pizza, but they kept our money.  Do not order from this store for delivery.  I would give them 0 stars  if I could."
1,"i used to buy incense here on a bi-weekly basis, because it is damn good. then i bought expensive massage oil here, and when the bottle fell off a table a foot from the ground, it broke. my husband tried to return it and the owner basically accused him of being a liar - they actually 'tested out' a separate bottle by filling it with water and dropping it on the floor. well congrats, assholes, that bottle is not dysfunctional LIKE THE ONE YOU SOLD TO ME WAS. beads and botanicals sucks and i hope it goes out of business. the end."
1,"Every time we go we are more disappointed than the time before,  I believe last night was it for us.  They put about a teaspoon of chicken on my sons tacos and although my husband asked for light sour cream the girl behind the counter proceeded to glob on about a cup on his burrito.  When my husband nicely said that he asked for light she looked up and said \""sorry\"" and proceeded to wrap his burrito.  Couldn't even crack a smile the whole time she helped us, and glared at my husband while we were paying.  Every time we go they put less and less meat in what ever we order, for one reason or another we are disappointed and vow to never go again.  Pretty sure last night we meant it."
1,"Decent car wash, but they have someone from a windshield replacement company on site that tried to scam my 78 year old mother into replacing her windshield. They even went as far as calling Allsate insurance for her and stared a claim. When the adjuster inspected my mom's car he told her that the chip in here windshield was to small to even require sealing and rejected the claim. When my mother told  the replacement company about this they said \""that's OK you can pay cash for the replacement\"". And she firmly told them NO and they still keep calling her. Stay away from this place!!!!"
1,"Why must this restaurant so notoriously SUCK?! With the exception of a few of these franchises, this corporation has got their big round ugly Jack-in-the-Box heads up their butts. Usually stinky lobbies with bad service and way over-priced food that tastes like they dug it out of the trash bin out back in the alley. At this particular Trop location, I ordered some fish with fries... what did I get? 3 triangles of frozen fish pieces thrown into a fryer and then loosely tossed into a carton that could hold 6 pieces, and a serving of burnt soggy fries slopped onto the tray with no napkins and no ketchup. One of the reasons this dump bothers me is because the company's commercials have that nitwit 'Jack' with his ever-annoying voice trying to act 'funny' while he tells us how cool and hip he is with his 'low-prices', 'good deals', and 'great food'. What can you say about a company that raises the price of a small cup of coffee to $1.81? The 99-cent cup of coffee should never change - even during a recession. They should give a little back to the patrons whom have made them the conglomerate they are. But nooo!.... make that extra buck, that extra quarter, that extra nickel, Jack-in-the-Box. Don't take a small loss or break even for 6 months. Well, I guess they WANTED me to avoid their restaurants in the future, because that's what I do now. Oh look! There's a McDonald's! Let's go!"
1,"This is the story of The Great Food Truck Clusterfuck.\n\nThe Food Truck Festival welcomed us with a hot dirt lot filled with thousands of people standing in zig-zaggy Disney Land-esque lines with maybe 20 - 25 food trucks.  The promotions for this event stated \""over 30\"" trucks would be there, but I guess that doesn't matter since you wouldn't be able to try all of them anyhow.  Each line was 50+ people deep and took 20 - 30 minutes of standing in one to get a bite size sample. \n\nYou had to stand in THREE lines to get a beer. One for ID check. One for wristband. One for beer. \n\nFor some reason, children were admitted for free - this created a mess of strollers trying to push through lines and unattended children running around, bumping in to people. \n\nThe Mister and I were here for 2 hours and tried itty bitty samples from four trucks.  I was so disappointed and frustrated in this event that I asked for a refund.  I was presently surprised that that process was very painless, basically no questions asked. The staff and cooks were all very friendly and did a great job, even though they were all in way over their heads. \n\nI understand that this is their first time putting on this event and they will sure have plenty to learn for the following years. I want to support this, and if I hear about changes being made I will certainly try it again next year."
1,"My thought: \""someone rescue me from the rude, crazy behemoth lady!!!\""\n\nI guess I should start from the beginning. I am in a time crunch and starving, and remembered that Wendy's is usually pretty solid when it comes to burgers. I decide to go to the drive thru.\n\nLady: \""HEEEELOOOO!!!\""\nMe: :\""umm..hi, I need just a minute\""\nLady: (heavy breathing and a grunt) \""fine\""\n\nI'm pondering and decide on the Swiss Jr Bacon and 5pc Chicken nuggets and order.\n\nMe: \""Ma'am?\""\nLady: \""YES\""\nMe: \""I would like the chicken nuggets and the Jr bacon swiss\""\nLady: \""Next window\""\n\nWow...I wonder what this broad looks like. My guess was something mean and ape-looking. I prepare to have the food thrown in my lap and arrive at the window. The lady just sticks her hand out of the window. I guess she want my debit card. I hand it to her. Nothing. She says nothing! Hands me the food. I ask if she had included Ranch (for my chicken nuggets). \""No, I don't think so\"". Well CAN I EFFING HAVE SOME RANCH...Puhlease!!!?!\n\nAfter all that, I wanted to take my chicken nuggets and burger and throw them in her face. It may have made her look better. Grrr..."
1,"I recommended this place to a friend of mine visiting from Australia, given it's convenient location to my house.  It was probably the worst recommendation I've ever made.  First, check in was late.  No apology, just an \""Oh, your room isn't ready but should be in a few hours\"" - this at after 4PM.  Second, they double charged him for his room - ie, they hard charged the entire stay in advance, and then \""authorized\"" the entire amount + incidentals  yet again (he was staying in a suite for eight days, so we're not talking chump change).  When it was pointed out, not only did the front desk not acknowledge the mistake, but proceeded to argue with him for three days, even though he showed bank verification of the double posting.  After three days of continuous hassle, and three days when several thousand dollars was no longer easily available for other events, they finally acknowledged and corrected their mistake, but failed to apologize or even offer any sort of compensation.  Third, room service ~ basically don't order anything but the fresh fruit, and don't make /any/ special requests, because you'll be ignored.\n\nSeriously, don't do what I did, do NOT EVER recommend this as a decent place to stay that's \""off Strip\"", because frankly, I've seen better front desk customer service at a Hawthorne Inn."
1,"They have a handful of noodle and rice dishes, curry dishes and some asian appetizers like gyoza and spring rolls.  The food is all pretty pricey at around 10 and the portions are smaller with way too little meat.\n\nWe tried mongolian beef and broccoli which was VERY bland.  I'm not sure if the broccoli was frozen, but there was water at the bottom.  The meat was overcooked so very tough.  We had to use the Siracha to make it edible.\n\nThe kung pao chicken I got with rice instead of noodles.  It was mostly cabbage and peanuts..  No heat pretty much whatsoever.  I think a school cafeteria probably could have done better.\n\nI tried to get bahn mi but the 3 options were lemongrass chicken, chicken teriyaki and steak.  (What, no pork?).\n\nWeird place, way overpriced, almost like Pei Wei - I'm not sure which one's worse."
1,"THIS REVIEW WAS WRITTEN DURING THE SUMMER OF 2013..\nLike the resort, nice units, decent amenities, nice pool, but the luau, wow... I brought my families to Vegas' top restaurants, meaning Gordon Ramsay Steak and others, and then we went to the infamous luau, literally nothing more then a soup kitchen for the price of Caesars Palace world renowned buffet..  I almost lost my mind when I joined the long slow line of people for what most people would call cafeteria food.. Absolutely horrible. We have been to luaus in Hawaii and this wasn't even close."
1,"I did not feel safe here. When you arrive, there are signs in the parking lot that say \""don't keep valuables in car\"".....or something like that. I ended up checking out early so that none of my things would be stolen by the gangta staff."
1,"My wife and I have  dined at Kabuto 5 or 6 times, and we have always had a  terrific experience; however, the last time we went there it was an epic fail. As always, we specifically made reservations for the sushi bar. We arrived a few minutes early; nevertheless, they told us they could not seat us at the sushi bar. They said that they cannot guarantee reservations at the sushi bar. Huh? What is the point of making a reservation if they will not honor the reservation? We always drop $300+ when we dine at Kabuto's, and for that kind of money we expect our reservations to be honored as long as we are punctual. There are many dining options in Vegas, so we will likely not go back to Kabuto."
1,"I love BW3. I'm not ashamed to admit it. Sometimes I just want a big beer and some bar food. One night (a Tuesday) the husband and I were both craving it so off we went. We entered and it wasn't too crowded but there seemed to be several larger (10+) parties seated at tables. The hostess attempted to seat us at a table, in the middle of these large parties. I said maybe we would just sit at the bar and she offered up a booth to the side, away from everyone else. \n\nSo we were seated, and we sat and sat and sat some more. I watched as all the waiters and waitresses flirted, talked and texted and set the timer on my phone after approximately 3 minutes of doing so. After another 5 minutes had passed and no one had approached us, including a manger I saw floating around near the not working servers, we decided it was time to leave. So we got up and walked out. It's a shame b/c I still have a craving for the food but won't return to this location unless I am just planning to sit at the bar and even that is going to take a while."
1,"This place is run by cavemen. When my party complained about the terrible service we were receiving, the manager told my husband to meet him at 2am when he gets off work so they could fight. You stay classy Joe's!"
1,"Aside from the shady night walkers, and the obvious drug dealers, the place is OK if you like living in a night club. I have reported the neighbors below me playing their music to loud and was told it wasn't that loud. Awful professional for them to basically tell me I have to put up with it. I was woken up at 1 am to the sound of my neighbors having a party. So the cops were called this time cause I don't want the office to tell me to deal with it. As for the drugs, I have smelled drugs in the air on numerous occasions. I have came home numerous times to see the apartment surrounded by cops. I have sat on my patio and watched the neighbors have a lot of \""visitors\"" that are only their for 5 minutes at a time. These \""visitors\"" might give off the appearance that they don't have a job where appearance is a priority. Face tattoos are a sign of that. This is my review of this place"
1,"The food is mediocre and the service is poor. Most of the servers don't have initiative when it comes to refilling beverages, removing used plates from the table and no teamwork. I asked one server if I could get another set of silverware. The server just looked at me and called to another server that worked in our section. No courtesy and no acknowledgment."
1,"The wait was ridiculous inside and outside. Keep in mind there was only one customer inside the Subway and one customer at the drive thru window. The sandwiches were barely filled with any toppings. I waited 35 minutes until I was even greeted. Normally I wouldn't wait that long because 35 minutes just to be greeted is ridiculous. Shortly after the worker said \""I'll be right with you\"" another 15 minutes passed. If I could give less than 1 star I would. Worst Subway experience ever. I will not be returning."
1,"I've eaten at Caramba's a couple of times hoping the experience would be different at different locations. I have to say, the food is awful. Everything seems to be smothered in a red sauce which does nothing for the food. Caramba is the epitome of disgusting, bland Mexican food"
1,The service was fine but the yogurt tasted off. My fianc\u00e9e got pineapple yogurt and it tasted spoiled. Some of the fruit tasted rancid. The only yogurt that tasted okay was the basic tart flavor. We won't be going back.
1,Went today to get lunch with my friends during work and first off all three of our burritos were about 75% rice. That doesn't bother me as I asked for rice and you get what you asked for. What bothers me is that all three of our steal burritos were raw. The steak looked cooking outside but as soon as you bit into a piece of steak you couldn't because it was so chewy. I looked into the piece and found it quite purple. I posted a picture as evidence
1,"We were told a half hr to 40 min wait, waited about an hour and a half to be seated. Once seated the service was terrible! It took our waiter Jeff another hour to get food on the table and to top it off he felt the need to school me on EVERYTHING I ordered in a very rude fashion! Then about another half our to pay. All together it took over three hours to get food, the food was not even very good and Jeff really worked my last nerve! HORRIBLE RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE! Save yourself and DO NOT got to Serendipity 3!!!!!!!"
1,"I've never been to San Gennaro and I doubt I will return. I am thankful I won tickets from Jelli radio. I will make a list.\n\n1. Everything here is overpriced. Each ride is $3 to $5 per person or $10 for all day access to bounce houses!\n2. Most places charge $9 to $15 for items. ($9 for a sausage and pepper hoagie)\n3. The layout is horrible and clustered.\n4. Some of the vendors don't belong there. (Scientology, politicos, sports teams bathing suites, a petting zoo)\n5. The majority of the vendors were serving the same damn thing.\n6. The BEST food was from a little place called FAT NINJA and it wasn't Italian at all.\n7. The talent wasn't really talent. (Although the little girls singing Sunday afternoon were so dang cute!)\n8. There was no festivities or anything celebratory.\n9. There was nothing really Italian about it.\n\nI really did enjoy spending with my friend, her son, and my sister. Very disappointed."
1,"Stopped by here tonight to have dinner at the bar.  Ordered a glass of wine and carpaccio to start.  First piece of beef that I picked up and put in my mouth was frozen, along with others around it.  Manager apologized and I walked out.\n\nHad an OK meal here the week before with service mishaps that could be blamed on the crowd there before the Pearl Jam concert, but tonight was a slow night, so two strikes and you're out in my book."
1,"If you can ship using another carrier, please do. A shipment was due to be delivered Thursday, it wasn't. It said shipment was due Monday. I called ups and asked to leave it at a location for pick up. The package was not available still until Monday.  The order was wrong so I tried to send it back using senders acct. No ups store would help. Had to come back to this dump. Line was out of the door. Lack of help here. Avoid at all costs."
1,"Oh HELL NO!! It had been at least 5 years since I'd been in here last...ugh a few beers at Nine Fine and my old age allowed me to forget how bad this place completely sucks! \n\nIt is an absolute train wreck. Instantly after walking in I felt the urge to leave but couldn't seem to muster up the strength. This was in part due to being crammed in this crap hole like sardines and also due to the sickening instinct to stick around and find out if the girls running the mic could say anything more stupid. \n\nLike many of the other reviews note, these girls are terrible. They'll shout just about anything possible in an attempt to get some sort of response from the crowd. One snippet went something like this, \""Who likes country music? Who likes rock music? Who likes rap?\"" Seriously? Who likes red crayons? Words can't explain how amped up I was when 10 people from the crowd made a half hearted attempt to express their love for rock music. \n\nFinally after about a 1/2 hour of this shenanigans, being sprayed with water (I hope it was water) from the gun, watching go-go girls that should just go home, we left. The absolute relief was like finding $40 in a pair of shorts you haven't worn since last summer. \n\nSteer clear my friend, steer clear!"
1,shit sandwich disgusting and huge line \nIf you like organic and healthuy walk away !!! insane that they are so successful maybe because of no competition around
1,"Not impressed - there were 2 people there who didn't have southwest stuff or run of the mill garage sale/craft show stuff.   We walk slow and were back to our car in less than 10 minutes.   I wasn't much impressed with the rest of Cave Creek AZ either - so if that's your thing, this might work out better for you."
1,Had my car in for a recall while it was there they said my cabin air filters needed to be changed so 100 bucks I did it ..one week later my sunroof was malfunctioning amongst other things brought it back in and again got the call that the cabin air filters needed to be changed!!!! SO I asked if they screwed me last week or if they were screwing me now all they said was o that's right I see now we did do that last week I don't know why that's there...hmm I do because they are liars!!!! .....I tried to trade my car in for my dream car and I was only going to have to finance about 22000 with my trade I told them I wanted like a 400ish payment with that small amount to finance it is possible seeing how I paid off one  car with them....NOPE they told me 750 for 6 yrs ARE YOU HIGH??? they said at lexus they don't have 400 dollar payments.  So I went to bmw financed the same amount and left with my low car payment and new dream car ..I will never do business with lexus again I guess they are just to good for me...
1,"Words cannot describe how disappointed I was in this meal. Every possible thing went wrong. We had ten people for a late reservation. The restaurant wasn't busy,and I had high hopes for a good meal. Sadly, there were major and minor problems. I will only outline he major ones below:\n\nFirst: we were seated late, despite our reservation. We ordered thirty minutes after being seated, another issue in my mind.\n\nSecond: our drinks took another 20 minutes and we never received bread or anything else to hold us over while waiting.\n\nThird: our sides never arrived, four of our ten entrees were incorrect, and the sashimi portions were ridiculously small, even for Las Vegas. Plus, the scallops were overbooked. This took two full hours from seating to delivery of our entrees. \n\nI really wanted to like this restaurant. I even made a reservation late and waited all day to eat. But I can unequivocally say DO NOT EAT HERE unless you want to be sorely disappointed."
1,"I'm really not one to give crappy reviews.  If you check my yelp ratings, you'll see that I usually only review things that i LOVE or HATE.  \n\nBattista's Hole in the Wall...i HATE this restaurant.  It's SOO over-priced -- yes you get free wine, but it tastes like vinegar; yes you get a \""set\"" menu, but it sucks.  everything just  tasted SOOO bad.  I can't believe the waiters don't feel bad serving you this food.  \n\nAlso, that little accordion man...he's sooo creepy.  shamelessly panders by playing a BAD song to get a tip at your table.  \n \nBEWARE.  DON'T GET TRICKED BY THE 4 STAR REVIEWS LIKE I DID.  DO NOT COME HERE."
1,"Went here Saturday after a long absence and was reminded why there has been such a long absence.  The food was mediocre and the facility is pretty run down. \nI had the BBQ Pork, coleslaw and peach cobbler while my wife had the BBQ Pork and potato salad. We both thought the BBQ pork was a 3 or 4 on a scale of 1 to 10 and the coleslaw and potato salad were no better.  I was so looking forward to the peach cobbler but even it wasn't very good.   If you're in the area and want good BBQ go two minutes away to Hap's BBQ on Washington and 48th.  Of course Joe's BBQ in Gilbert is great too and even Famous Dave's kicks this place."
1,"Overrated!  Overpriced!  They reheat their pizza, the guy pulled out a slice of cold pizza from underneath the counter and reheated for us.  Needless to say, it tasted like a day old pizza reheated in the microwave, who knows when it was cooked.... Compared to a Lombardi's white pizza, well there is no comparison.  The Secret Pizza was luke warm (that reheating thing does not work for me), the cheese was really chewy (baked hours ago), and the crust was not really that thin like a true NY pizza.  Overall, this place is way overrated and overpriced.  $6 for a slice of pizza is no deal......\n\nThis place should stay \""secret,\"" BTW, unlike many of the other reviews, I was sober when I ate the pizza...."
1,This is one of the filthiest restaurants I have ever had the misfortune to go into - I was shocked that this place remains open.  The food was worse than mediocre - truly poor in every aspect.\nICK.
1,"Called and made an appointment to get my tire repaired.  When I went there, the receptionist/salesman went outside to look at my tire which had a slow leak and was not fully inflated.  He then said they could not repair it because it was too worn and was dangerous.  He then went into a hard sales pitch about getting a new tire.  My car has less than 25,000 miles. Obviously, if a tire is not fully inflated, the tread will look shallower.  Waste of time, will never go back there or any discount tire again.  I really like how they take you outside so they can lay the sales pitch on outside of the other customers earshot.  Also, I can't be 100% sure but I think he put in a nail while I wasn't looking (it was magically in my direct line of view and was glinting in the sun and looked very clean) .  Stay away from these crooks!  They didn't even bother to try filling my tire with air.  Good thing I have my own inflator."
1,"My advice to the upstairs bartender: take a deep breath, sit back, and reassess your career choice if working at a fun, packed show in a cool city is that much misery for you."
1,"I have always liked this car wash. I've been going to them for 8 years, from the time I had my hoopty til I upgraded to my truck.\n\nRecently though, their job had been pretty sloppy.\nMaybe I came in at the wrong time, maybe I came in at a bad day? Not sure. \nBut the last 2 instances that I got my truck washed here, I left with the same spots and dirt I came in here for.\n\nMy window that they were supposed to wipe inside and out still has that toddler's sticky hand print. My console, which used to have a dried flower, didn't seem to have been cleaned as well. My windshield still had that film from the inside, and the list goes on and on..\n\nI'm not a perfectionist. But the dirt were really obvious and I can't seem to convince myself that  had just gone to a car wash.\n\n90% of Car Wash customers are repeat business while 10% are referrals. Seriously, I think I have given this place a few chances but always end up wasting my time and money. \n\nReally disappointed. :(\n\nUPDATE: 10/30/14\nIgnore Michael's comment on here. The first one he posted had his email and phone number and sent him a private message about my experience. The second one, he edited and posted something to sound more sympathetic. Contacted him again through Yelp this time (thinking he didn't get the email) but IGNORED both messages and DIDN'T EVEN RESPOND. Michael, STOP pretending like you care about your customers."
1,"This franchise group can care less about their customers.  I had a problem they contacted me quickly, went to look at my vehicle then never responded to my questions again.  I have never been treated so poorly by any establishment and this franshise group had the worst customer service ever.  I read their BBB complaints and they denied every single one, just like mine.  I recommend going to brakes lus or any other company, they are very nice, kind and half the cost of Jiffy Lube."
1,"My consultant was Debbie. She brought me about six dresses and then she disappeared for the rest of the time we were there. I'm assuming this happened because I said that I wasn't sure I was buying anything quite yet, therefore she wouldn't get a sale. Regardless of if you are buying a dress or not, you should get the one on one attention. Anyway, my mom had to assist me in and out of all the dresses and figure out how to pin them to fit me the right way. She never once came back to retrieve the dresses and my mom had to clear out the dressing room in order for there to be room again. My aunt had to go searching for more dresses for me to try on. Also, the overall ambience of the store is completely outdated. Pink walls and mint green carpet with stains on it is not a pleasant aesthetic to any room. The bathroom was disgusting and the soap was out so we had to use hand sanitizer instead. I went to a different bridal shop after this and my experience was completely opposite making me realize just have awful my experience at David's bridal was. DO NOT GO HERE."
1,"What a freak show.  Waited for a pizza order and watched the counter guy getting his neck and cheeks rubbed by another guy who was wearing a grey coat and was obviously not working there at the time.  Another employee start laughing and a fight broke out behind the counter.  They carried the guy in the grey coat out the door and he was swearing up a storm.  The guy he punched eventually waited on me.  I don't know who owns this place but they need to know what happened and what a bunch of misfits are working there.  Great food.  Creepy employees.  Keep the recipe, get new help.  Others witnessed this crap.  Happened on Thursday around 7:30 pm.  Never again."
1,"I started off with 5 stars on this place but after my last 2 visits, it dropped to 1 star.  \n\nWhen I walked in the last couple times I was treated like I was annoying him because he was in the middle of eating his food.  When we finally got over the attitude this last time (after is asked if I was bothering him by wanting to spend my $ there) I ordered the street tacos.  The brisket was mostly fat and the tortillas were dripping oil.  After taking a couple bites I threw the food away.  This is not the first time this has happened but it is the last.  I thought I would give this joint another chance and they continued to fail me.  Stay away from Ryno's."
1,"I may not be the fanciest person to be walking into a store in this part of town, but I am not invisible. Waited a good ten minutes as the salesperson chatted with a woman at the counter, explaining a complicated food regimen for her cat, over and over, looking at photos on her phone, with nary any acknowledgment of me even there. Ignoring a customer ready to pay for a product standing right in front of you? Really, unheard of in direct retail. Believe it or not there are plenty of stores selling high end pet food these days, and most of these stores actually want my money. I put the bag down at the front door and walked out, still no acknowledgment. This location happens to be extremely convenient for me but it will never get my business again, it was an insulting experience."
1,"The worst Thai food I've had in Pittsburgh. The service was slow, but expected for a Friday night. Wait staff is friendly. Restaurant is noisy when crowded. The food was a big disappointment. We had the fish in ginger sauce and mixed seafood with basil leaves. The fish was overcooked, the scallops in the mixed seafood dish had gone bad, and neither dish was tasty. What do others see in this restaurant?"
1,"Meat dept is deplorable . They sold frozen meat, actually with frost on it. I do not have any confidence that the meat is fresh despite what date they had on the label. I believe the State Food inspectors should review this Fry's location!!!"
1,"Meine Erfahrung: H\u00e4lt man sich zu lange in einem Bereich auf, da man erst berechnet, wie die jewiligen Elemente zusammenpassen sollen. Tr\u00e4gt man ein Produkt an einen anderen Ort, um zu \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen, ob bestimmte Elemente zu anderen passen, tr\u00e4gt sie dann wider zur\u00fcck  dann wird man vom Detektiv nach der Kasse abgefangen. Man sollte hier nicht den Kopf verlieren und den Detektiv auffordern, eine Videoaufzeichung vorzulegen und zugleich die Polizei zu rufen. Der Detektiv hatte ein Fitting in der Hand  und ich dachte schon, er wollte behaupten, da\u00df er mir das gerade aus meiner Tasche gefischt hat. Das erzeugt nat\u00fcrlich die Vermutung, da\u00df der Detektiv auch die M\u00f6glichkeit hat, einem unaufmerksamen K\u00e4ufer etwas in seine Tasche oder Jackentasche zu schmuggeln. Fazit: nicht vertrauensw\u00fcrdiges Gesch\u00e4ft  ganz gleich, wie weitreichend und qualitativ das Sortiment auch sein mag."
1,"Employees stood around while I'm waiting for my to-go milkshake. Locating inside an airport, isn't it common sense that people are rushing to their flight, especially if it's a to-go order. After waiting for more then 10 mins for my shake, I went over to the kitchen side and asked if my shake was ready. Then they started making it! What the heck? What were they standing around for????"
1,I've never been to an establishment that treats their customers so badly. The owner literally shooshed my one and a half year old and then told us our children are too loud. I should mention that we were the only ones in the whole restaurant. He didn't even let us tell the kids to quiet down. He was rude and his actions were ugly towards some mommies and their toddlers just wanting to eat lunch. It was hateful and we will never go back.
1,"(edited to tone it down)\n\nPros:\n\n- Pizza is great\n- Beer specials on Mondays are awesome.\n\nCon:\n\n- The restaurant can be a playground for screaming children. \n\nI'm just trying to eat, have a beer, talk, and watch the game. I don't want to deal with a bunch of screaming kids running all over the place and fighting over the arcade game in the corner. Even the great beer specials on Mondays are not worth listening to that. \n\nIt must be noted that there is only so much the management can do about other peoples' children. Their parents should manage the volume - but I think some just become habituated to it.\n\nMaybe it's not like that every night. But we have noticed it twice.\n\nIf you eat here, just ask to be seated in the corner farthest from the arcade game, unless you enjoy the sound of shrieking children after working all day.\n\nObviously, if you have kids, they're a family-friendly restaurant."
1,Un peu cher pour les faibles quantit\u00e9 et qualit\u00e9s des plats. La carte offre peu de choix et aucun dessert.
1,"The worst food I've ever had.  Service was okay he only check on us twice, warm soda had to\nWater it down with ice to make it cold. our food sucked. Just yucky good. Huge plates. Just yucky food. Pictures does lie.  What looks good is not always good.  My husband was like \""we should of went to fat burger!!\"" Lol."
1,"Absolutely disgusting!!!\n\nTried to re-serve food that was incorrectly served to, and touched by, another patron, and was then subsequently rifled through by the employee that mis-served it. \n\nAfter being called out, the employee tried to deny that she had done it, and management refunded the money, and SWORE, that nothing like that would ever happen again. \n\nWhen asked how he could insure that, he shrugged his shoulders, told me that the money had been returned, and that I could have a good day...knowing too well that no reprimand, training, or further influence would be put upon the offending employee. \n\nI know it's fast food, and that you get what you pay for, but I grew up working in a similar restaurant to earn money when I was a kid.  We took pride back then. I actually think this is a comment about the nature of the new work force.  Quite shocking and disappointing, even for a low level fast food restaurant."
1,"Horrible service, called in order and messed it up quite badly and I will suggest my work gets catering from somewhere else and I for sure will not order here again since they messed my order up 3 times."
1,This place was disgusting even my 12 year old did not like it. Everything came out of a box. We were very disappointed and will not return to this buffet.
1,"The food was flavorless and overcooked. The service was terrible, took forever to get anything and the staff was very rude. But the worst thing of all was how DISGUSTING the place was. EVERYTHING had a nasty film on it. The pictures on the walls were splattered with food. The sugar caddy was dripping with something sticky. And the chairs had food on them when we sat down. NEVER COMING BACK"
1,I've been there a couple of times. Last time I went it was worse than the first time. The food  really didn't taste that good.
1,"0 Stars if I could\n\nThe new owner & management is not customer focused.  We walked in last Saturday at 9:00 am and there was not one customer in there.  We inquired about getting two pedicures, the owner/manager told us they couldn't help us because we didn't have an appointment.  They were expecting their first appointment at 10:00 am.\n\nNeedless to say we walked out and will not be returning."
1,Horrible expirence on Black Friday! First off I had to use the restroom I go inside and there's blood on the walls & sink! Gross! Second it took 30 min just to pay cause there systems weren't showing the Black Friday deals they were advertising. Overall I would never go there again!
1,"I have an inside joke with my significant other about this place. We officially hate Charlotte. Everyone who works in this airport is miserable. So it has made us assume that everyone in Charlotte must be as well.  \n\nFor its size, they could have a bit more selection if someone wants to get a quality meal. Every place I've eaten here is horrible. \n\nVery nicely decorated though. Sweet rocking chairs."
1,"I gave this place 2 chances before firing them as my dentist.  Being a graduate student on the graduate student dental plan, I did not have many options as who my dentist would be.  I regret chosing Champaign Dental Group.\n\nMy first negative experience was when a dental assistant tried fitting me for whitening trays.  He clearly had never done this before because the mixture was way too hard and he was using a tray too big for my mouth.  The result was SEVEN attempts of putting the trays in my mouth and removing them and subsequent severe cuts in my mouth.  I was called back the next day because the impression was not good enough to make a mold out of and had to redo the entire process again.  \n\nAlready not happy about my experience at Champaign Dental Group, I went ahead and scheduled my next appointment 6 months in advance.  I recieved a card with my appointment time and was had a reminder call 2 days before my scheduled appointment.  When I arrived my appointment was no where to be found and my dentist wasn't even working that day.  \n\nI guess this is what happens when you run your dental practice like a business production."
1,The service is great. The food is good.  I come here every week for 1.5 years just to have magic hat on tap and they replaced it with less than appealing options. \n\nBRING BACK MAGIC HAT #9 !!!!!!!\n\nAnyone else agree?
1,"My wife and I felt like a good pastrami sandwich after a late appointment.  The service was ok but they were out of half-sour pickles and the hot pastrami was cold pastrami and it tasted like it had been sitting in the kitchen for awhile.  We told the waitress and she offered us a piece of cake or a cookie as a response.  We've been patronizing them for years, usually for a bowl of soup for lunch.  Tonight was the worst meal I've ever had there!.  We will not be back!"
1,Ordered food online. They failed to deliver 1 of the 5 combos we ordered. They use grubhub for orders and told us we had to take it up with grubhub and offered no resolution. It also took them 30 minutes longer to deliver than promised. Terrible service.
1,"We had the all-you-can eat experience, and it was a complete waste of money.  At a steep $45 a person, DO NOT waste your money here!  We love Espetus in the Bay Area, and this was nothing like it.\n\nThe only things we liked were:  \n1) Bacon Wrapped Turkey\n2) Sirloin \n\nAnd they honestly were not amazing... just better than the other options.\n\nThe meal started out slow, where we had to wait about 20 minutes to get the starting salad (iceburg lettuce with some beets).  The sides were also subpar, just tiny bowls of plantains, beans, rice, and stir-fried green beans/carrots.\n\nWhat really annoyed me was that the first skewer of \""meats\"" to come around were garlic bread and chicken legs.  Really?!  My husband was so hungry that he tried one of each, which I guess is Samba's strategy.  They were both kind of gross.\n\nThe other meats were okay, but for the price I expected a lot better quality of meat.  Finally, the dessert comes, and I was hoping that it would save the meal.  But sadly they were literally little shot glasses of flavored pudding...  A big disappointment!\n\nSo if you are dining at the Mirage, do not make the same mistake we did!  Eat at the Cravings buffet instead!"
1,"It has been a few years since my one and only visit. But since I still think of it every time I drive by, I feel compelled to share. \n\nI went with a friend and we ordered a root beer float to share. It cost about $6 and there was just one scoop of frozen custard in a glass of root beer. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw what they gave us for that amount of money. I will never go again."
1,"My last review was great but unfortunately this one isn't. My grandson wanted to go here for his 18th birthday for their whole Maine lobster so I called them to see if they were going to have the lobster on that day. \nI was told \""we can have it anytime as long as you let me know ahead of time\"". So great, I told him we'll be there in two days. \nWhen we did go we ordered the lobster and the waiter said we don't have lobster tonight so I said please ask the chef because I was assured we would have the lobster. He returned and said no I'm sorry we don't have any. Ok so let's move on. Grandson got veal Parmesan, husband got meatball sub and I ordered chicken Marsala. Veal was really good meatball sub was so so. Sauce was not on sub was on the side and meat balls was just ok. I asked for linguini with my chicken Marsala and I got angel hair. Sent it back and came back with linguini but I asked where's the Marsala sauce? I was told that's how we make it. Two small pieces fried chicken, no sauce. This was an unfortunate 18th birthday."
1,"If this is what you can expect from award winning Chinese food in Las Vegas, you are in trouble.  The place seemed very popular.  They opens at 11 and there were already a score of people waiting outside at 10:45 on a Wednesday.  They also had a full house for lunch service.  With these said, the service and food are horribly disappointing.   Our combination BBq only filled half a plate and was $14.  The beef was cut into too large size and hard to chew.  I ordered some fried rice for kids and it was very blend without taste.  This is also a cash only place, which makes me wonder what they are doing with the tax they are collecting.  In summary, rude waiters, horrible food, expensive menu.  Needless to say, we won't return and will be looking for greener pastures."
1,Nasty sales reps.. She told me my legs were too fat to fit in the rain boots!! They fit with lots of room!! Idiots!! Never shopping at burberry again!! I don't know how the sales reps even keep customers in the store!!
1,"When to Home Depot to buy a replacement hot water heater and when I asked about installation price I was told $550.00 compared to $250 to $350 with every article I read on the web. What was worse, I was told I was paying for a quality installer. End of the story, I went to Lowes and found a similar hot water heater and their contractor and installation price ($275.00) were both aligned with my expectations. I'll still shop at Home Depot but will always check out thier contractors."
1,"This place missed the mark on so many levels for us. \n\nI'll start with the service, since this was the only great part of the experience. Our waiter was very friendly and spent time with us going over the menu. He was attentive, brought us everything we asked for and offered to replace my soup when I didn't like it. He gets the 1 star I gave here. \n\nHere's my list of the bad:\n- What the hell is that wall of dead birds? \n- The wood fired beets - tasted more like rubber lumps, no wood fired taste. \n- The pan fried corn - yes, it's pan fried corn, my bad for expecting some spices in there. \n- The onion soup - overly salty and has a strong, unidentifiable flavor. \n- The scallops - nothing special at all.\n- The prices - for what we paid, I would expect to be spoon fed while being fanned with palm leaves. Really a said combo of inflated prices and mediocre food you could prepare at home for nothing.\n\nAnd be forewarned: Everything is a la carte. Ordering scallops? That's $20, and then you may add a side for $7. What a joke. \n\nBring a fat wallet  of money you were thinking of setting on fire and low expectations and you should leave happy."
1,"Crappy service. From the hostess to the waiter, they didn't seem to care. Seemed very understaffed. Took 40 minutes to get food and had barely six tables worth of customers in the whole place. Almost left. Wrong drinks. Had to chase someone down to get anything. Food below average. I get it's a coffee shop so wasn't expecting anything spectacular but this is pretty bad. Couple of dry patty melts, runny scrambled eggs that were a little tougher than is normal. Only thing that was somewhat edible was the club sandwich. Cashier asked how our meal was told her it was bad and about how we were about to leave before food arrived. She said .... I'm sorry and will let management know... No wait that wasn't it. At least that would have been some consolation. She said... Oh... And nothing else. Lol ya they just don't give a crap. Go somewhere else"
1,"HORRIBLE.\nShowed up, got stale bread. Took 45min to get glasses of water. The food was cold.\nWaitress spilt water on 2 of us.\nOrdered a Nata for desert. It was stale and old. Returned it. Then the waitress complained that she couldn't re sell it, squeezed it in our face arguing it was fresh. Clearly it wasn't, you could throw it at a wall and it would bounce back at you. After the horrible service, the waitress counted her tip in front of us and complained if she didn't receive a good amount.\nAVOID THIS RESTAURANT!!"
1,"I ordered take out of Tom Yum soup and Chilli Chicken, what a disappointment. None of these tasted good, Tom Yum soup was kinda disgusting."
1,"We went to CPK and it was terrible, our server was in our face the whole time. It was as if she was trying to rush us out and there was no wait for tables. Then, we had another server running the floor vacuum around our table and under our table, hitting our feet. I hate when restaurants allow this practice. It is discussing and intrusive with little regard for your customers! The food was cold and flavorless. I will never return to this restaurant.... avoid it's a waste of your $$$."
1,Avoid this place like the plague!! Management is so terrible its not even funny.  No atmosphere and food is just ok (if you even get it) I only had to wait an hour for my burger. Haha what a joke go out of business already and do us all a favor. And for you that run this restaurant (not the waiters and bartenders because its not there fault) you should be embarrassed and exit the food industry immediately.
1,"So disappointed.  I have been seeing Dr. Davey for a year.  I went to have a prescription refilled and the phones have been disconnected, they pharmacy can not get any response.  Did this practice close?  Where are my records and why was I not notified?"
1,Just walked out of this place after being seated and ignored for 15 minutes in a mostly empty restaurant.  3 servers walked past us and even after alerting the empty headed hostess of our plight another 5 minutes passed.  We gave up and have forever given up on this place.  Can't wait for Sushi Brokers to open their new location.  At least the service is\nalways good there.  Done with Stingray!
1,"Wed afternoon, only 4 people in the place and THE COOK FORGOT TO MAKE OUR PIZZA???? REALLY???????\nThe waiter brought us some one elses pizza too.\n. The manager DID NOT EVEN OFFER TO TAKE IT OFF OUR BILL. Said the GM wouldn't allow it. But would buy us dessert? HA HA i just wanted what i ordered.\nWe always eat early to avoid long waits and bad service BOY DID WE GET TRICKED!!!!!! My family and I will NEVER EVER GO THERE AGAIN, TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! And I let them have too!"
1,"Grave disappointment!  My family and I spent the entire week in LV, and had the pleasure of dining in many restaurants, 3 meals a day.  The food here was the absolute worst.  Service was ok, but the food was not at all what we would expect from Wolfgang Puck.  I was served a piece of salmon that clearly was not fresh.  Food was tasteless, including the sauces, especially on the pizza.  Coming from New York and having dined in Wolfgang's Steakhouse many times, we had high expectations, which unfortunately didn't materialize here in Vegas. So many places to dine along the strip - spend your money elsewhere."
1,"I don't think I've ever been more concerned for my safety than the hour I stayed here. Checked in, creeped out and waited for my taxi to come back and get me the hell out of there. That made up my hour. The taxi driver that dropped me off told me, \""if you stay here, lock your door and do not come out.\""  I was fine until my door wouldn't stay locked and especially after I noticed the peep-hole was plastered closed.\nAnd just for clarification, it's the BEST WEST INN MOTEL. had I known it was a motel, I would have never selected it."
1,"Boo bestbuy. You are a major inconvinience for me. And your employees are brain dead. I only like the fact that you are close to my house, but that sorta doesn't count anymore because Circuit city is now closer to me. You know best by, your not the best and maybe I don't wanna buy from you anymore! Why don't you put that in your back pocket?"
1,"1.  It's a bar in a supermarket complex.\n\n2.  And I got turned away at the door tonight, because I was wearing dark nondescript sneakers. \n\n3.  Did I say it's a bar in a supermarket complex?\n\nI was to meet some co-workers here tonight, my first time out socializing in Scottsdale.  Since the evening weather dropped to below 70, I changed out of my shorts and flip-flops and dusted off my Bay Area hipster gear (long sleeve jersey tee, blue jeans, nondescript black sneakers, and jumped onto the 101.\n\nI was looking for some trendy area, with little boutique stores, restaurants, bar scenes and bums asking for spare change.  Instead, I was greeted by gas stations, a CVS Pharmacy, a crowded parking lot (with, oooh!, valet parking!), and a long line to get in.\n\nWhen I got to the front of the line, I was carded.  No problem with that.  Then the bouncer got a whiff of my god awful sneakers and kicked me to the curb.  Are you kidding?  A supermarket bar with a no-sneakers policy?  \""Heavens forbid we allow any riff-raff in our fine establishment!\"" had half a mind to put up a real stink, but instead called my friend inside and had a loud-mouthed ranting conversation with him about the idiot policy, while the other line-standers looked at me uncomfortably.\n\nI should just stay in Tempe and party with my students..."
1,"Do not ever use this team of misguided misfits for property management.  They are senile incompetent and incapable.  They managed my property and would never have anything repaired at my request, or my tenets request.  They failed to service my air conditioner after several requests to service it.  This cost me 4000.00 to replace the unit due to lack of service. Nola the owner is a big double talker sales woman who never listens to any thing but rather talks loudly over you to avoid any form of accountability.  She does not document anything. The only thing they do a good job at is billing me and deducting the management  fee from my rent.  I had to fly 2000 miles to go to my condo, coordinate contractors to fix all the repairs and set up a service plans myself.  The story goes on believe me never buy a house from them or use them for property management they are the worst I've ever been associated with.  To date I can not get my tenants down payment returned to her. They are very dishonest."
1,"I was there to see Dixie Swim Club, The play was fun the actors were very good.  The food was horrible!!"
1,"Date & Time of Visit:  May 21, Dinnertime\n\nI don't know what this place was thinking with their eighty-five-dollar, eight-course tasting menu.  That menu had microscopic-size courses and the taste, after the first two (2) courses, were repetitive--and mostly on the sweet side.  Moreover, the place has the sticky feel that one would associate with divey restaurants.  As for their restroom, only one and a unisex one at that.  And yes, there was urine on the floor."
1,"The owner Jeff Dugan is a joke. The worst experience with an unprofessional company - they will hang up on you, swear at you and not fix your plumbing problem. We had someone out 3 times for the same thing and the last one looked like the guy who sits at the 1-10 ramp asking for money. Really, worse than a rip off. I would do zero stars if possible. You'd do better calling any other company."
1,"El lugar esta mas o menos, el due\u00f1o con cara de amargado y no saluda aquien llega a su mugroso restaurante, las pupusas estan ricas pero quede traumada porque una vez ami esposo le dieron su bebida echa a perder, la bebida sabia a agria y las pupusas un sabor espantoso"
1,"If you are looking for a place that is like a club and restaurant at the same time, you got to come to RA Sushi. The restaurant is dark. The music is soooo loud, you cannot hear the person next to you. \n\nThis place is another lame attempt of a trendy sushi restaurant. The selection of sushi is disgusting. I do not know how the came up with their menu. Maybe they drew ingredients out of a hat and decided to roll it up in rice and seaweed. \n\nThe one thing I was looking forward to was the Cinnamon Tempura Ice Cream. This dessert was the biggest let down. The raspberry glaze they cover it with is the nastiest thing I have ever tasted. It was so bitter. It made the whole dessert inedible. \n\nI will never be back to this location or any of their other ones. I have no idea how they stay in business or open new locations."
1,I decided to give these guys another chance and I'm sad to say that they have lost my business forever. I made an appointment online several days in advance for 12:00pm to have an alignment done. I drove all the way down there and the guy took all of my information and then when I said it was for an alignment he said they had no power and that they couldn't do it. Why wouldn't someone call me instead of making me drive  there?! Bad business. I decided to bring my car to Brake Masters instead and not only were they professional...they were $10 cheaper!
1,"SCAM!!!  Price more than doubled from estimate over the phone.  DO NOT USE!!!   After waiting nearly 40 minutes outside with two small children the \""locksmith\"" arrived--no company car (he couldn't even tell me the name of the company!!!--he said he was just a contractor working for several companies).  Well, we paid $100 for one deadbolt lock to be removed!  RUN from these guys!!!"
1,"My friends and I have been going to this place for years. They have a beer bust on Friday nights and thats what we do.\n\nLast night,  we were standing around talking and laughing and one of the shot guys comes by, offers us some shots, and we say \""no thanks\"". The shot guy walks away and we start talking and laughing again. He comes back and asks if we were laughing at him. We looked at him like \""are you serious?\"" and he calls my friend a faggot. He then calls over security to have us kicked out for apparently being rude .\n\nWe tell the security guy what happened. The security guy apologizes and then calls over the manager (the owner's son?).  I'm telling this guy this is not a place for his obvious straight employee (or any other employee) to be using that kind of language. The manager tells us his shot guy has never had anything like this happen in the 8 months he'd been working there. My friend tells the manager  we'll file a complaint with the Pride Committee. And then- we were 86'd!! (KICKED OUT!) \n\nMoral of the story- It's bad that there's enough places in Vegas to be called a faggot. Didn't think it would be acceptable at Freezone- a gay bar- in the Fruit Loop!"
1,No one was friendly walking in. Someone got seated after us but they had their food before we received water. The waitress did not check on us during our meal. We had to tell the busboy to get our server 2 times. I had a simple soup and salad which took 30 mins to bring out. Then she never brought us our check. When we asked for it the check took another 10 mins. It was terrible service I don't understand how someone can serve a table like that. I know this is not fine dining but McDonalds has better service that. Come on Olive Garden seriously? Maybe she had a bad day but don't take it out on customers. I don't think I will be coming back.
1,"OK PEOPLE...time for a REAL review.  The ONLY thing this restaurant has going for it is the wait time in a Sunday morning...walk in and get seated. That is because the place is not busy here is why:\n\n1) The place is FILTHY. From the end tails  and smears on the tables, to the seats with crumbs spots and food/skid marks to the tops of the booths that have at least 1 month of dust, lint and dirt build up. \n\n2) The food was horrible!  For example the 5 minute rice was either cooked for 3 minutes or cooked the night before. The pork was approximately 50% fat and 50% meat which is being extremely generous in the meat allocation. The scrambled eggs were rubbery like they were pulled from the stay warm buffet. Ahh the buffet...leaves a lot to be desired for a buffet. They actually serve the end pieces of the toast...perhaps the owner likes them and so should everyone else. And finally the bacon...careful asking for crispy....it will be cooked and then deep fried to the point of turning to dust. \n\n3) Wanna be Village Inn pie concept sans pies with a sully's tavern kind of flair using furniture that makes things made in China sold by KMart and IKEA Look like high end quality furnishing. \n\n4) Service...well if you mess up the order...comp the meal, make it right, comp something else...don't server the end tails.  \n\nNever going back and neither should you. Recommend closing this place. THE END!"
1,"The party ain't over until all the grotesque regulars at this horrid place come a running. Seriously I think this place is long over due for a shut down. It's dirty, smelly, the food is absolutely terrible, and the atmosphere is a tragedy. They'll lure you in with the idea of live bands playing yet all it consists of is a bunch of weird drunken regulars that get absolutely trashed on stage and  can't perform. Seriously this place is a dive bars worst nightmare. They don't even have any drinks on tap and don't get me started on the Nintendo room it looks like a creepers dream palace because it's unfathomably weird and may be the most unsanitary place in the whole restaurant. Seriously one call to the health department can totally shut this place down I'd advise it ASAP. Save your money and time people, there are much better areas to go and listen to music and meet people, I'd advise any other place but here."
1,"Came here for dinner last night with my family for my husbands birthday . Usually service is great and I leave impressed . Unfortunately a football game was on while we were dining. So we didn't get the usual attention . Our order was wrong and while we asked for food to be packed our servers response was \"" that doesn't travel well\"" well we are actually local so we have a fridge at home . The icing on the cake was when the server asked if we wanted dessert . We said no thank you to which he responded with \"" we have a birthday dessert for you \"" with that being said who turns down free dessert . $329 later that dessert was $30 . Which I probably would have not gotten being my husband prefers the strawberry shortcake . Lesson learned Carmine's , to not come in with football is playing because then your employees would have to work . Thanks to our server for making sure we would probably go to Rao's spend the extra money but it would be worth it ."
1,Only thing this place had going was the convenience of the buffet. Now gone service and food always subpar.  New ownership?.   Still not near the quality of anything in 20 mile radius.   Don't waste ur time
1,"By far the worst service ever, besides the manager being incompetent and not knowing how to asses the situation and know how to manager the room he rather have a bunch of upset customers who are they to watch their team play, he has the sound and tv on games that no fans are their. Then the waitress brought the wrong order. Over all they all looked like chickens with their heads cut off. I've never ever not left a tip but this is one time I will not."
1,"Housed in the former Hawaiian Tropic space it appears that not much has changed on the service front. We stopped by for happy hour which included $3 domestic drafts and had to practically shoot a gun in the air to get a bartenders attention. With the exception of the lack of bikinis, the bartenders are just as inattentive, robotic and surly as the former bartenders at HT. With cheap beer flowing like water on the strip there is really no reason to visit the PBR again."
1,"Ate dinner at the Tahiti Village Restaurant last Wednesday evening. The waitress was very attentive, this review is about the food and only the food.  It was terrible.  If you compare what was described on the menu to what was brought to the table it was defiantly false advertising.  My husbands Seared Ahi was cooked through.  The next day he was sick (I will spare you the details).  The Coconut shrimp was tough.  The salad with watermelon was the only thing that saved the meal.  I asked the waitress to take the Ahi off the bill and she did so with no argument and agreed that the Ahi was definitely not what was described on the menu.  You should really think twice before going here for dinner.  \n\nThe food that was being cooked on the grills (by the guests) was probably 10 times better, but we didn't get invited to share their food.  It sure did smell good!"
1,"To my disappointment, the height of the palazzo structure blocks the sun from hitting nearly all pool areas. As a result, I had sunless pool time the entire four days. Huge disappointment if you enjoy tanning time or just regular Vegas sun intake."
1,I scheduled this company to come to my house TWICE and both times they no showed. I called after the second time of them not showing up and the woman could seem to care less or be apologetic at all. I would never recommend anyone to use them.
1,"I tried this salon for a second time hearing from a friend it was under new management. I will not be back. Yes, it was a lot less crowded then my usual spot and now I know why. My pedi was VERY quick. There was only one other customer  so it wasn't because they were busy. I was asked if I wanted callus remover. I said I no because I didn't have calluses. She said it will be good for my dry feet. I agreed because my usual salon includes it. I was asked if I wanted a manicure. I said no. She was persistent saying it would only be $10.00 extra so I agreed. It was barely anything except for the cut on my finger that bleed for an hour and still looks bad a day later. She cut my cuticles, rubbed some lotion very hard on my hands and forearms, barely buffed my nails (not to a shine) and that was it. At check out I was surprised to find the callus remover (a gel put on cotton pad placed on my heel for 30 sec) was an extra $5.00. I felt deceived.  This salon is marked off my list."
1,"Used a groupon and first time there. Starts with bartender welcoming us then because we said we wanted to sit at a table she got a crabby.  With a rude tone said we will have to come to her if we want any drinks. We didn't but might of if we didn't get that attitude. \n\nThen go to use groupon at the counter and the amount over was less than 15 so she wouldn't let me use card. Finally got our food and it was ok but nothing special. Was for sure not worth the 35 it would have cost for chicken strips, union rings, a hotdog, shake and drink.\n\nPlace looked nice but they don't run it very well."
1,"Didn't want to taste anything here because when I asked to speak to the owner, I was told by the manager that the owner would not be receptive of me \""if you know what I mean\"" is what she said. I took this as a racial remark"
1,"If you think you're going to get Mexican food, go somewhere else now. I'm from Nor Cal so I think I've been spoiled with Mexican food. We went in here because we were REALLY hungry, there was a line so we thought it was good food. Ordered the chimichanga burrito and the regular chicken burrito. It took a while to get our orders since it was busy dinner time. I was standing at the counter and did realize that they put EVERYTHING in the microwave. We took it to go and when we go to our rooms we realized we hadn't gotten any chips or salsa, and biting into the burritos there was absolutely no flavor in the food. It was like they just through stuff together and hoped for a miracle. Do yourself a favor and keep looking for food...Gordon Ramsey would go crazy if he came in here..."
1,"This place sucks. \n\nI have seen a few bands here. The sound quality sucks and the shows are expensive. Why? I wondered the whole time because its cheap...they have concrete floors, horrible bouncers, and a lame patio with broken plastic seating. \n\nOh and for parking just walk across the bridge park in the public parking lot. They rip you off. \n\nDrinks are a rip too. \n\nand for the most part crap bands play here."
1,"I was so excited to try this place, it looked so promising. The service is decent. The d\u00e9cor was cool. The food is of terrible quality.\n\nI got the portobello burger. The portobello cap was cooked well enough, but the bun was dry as hell. I gave up on the bun after two bites and just ate the portobello and toppings. Speaking of which, they don't give you much for toppings. So when that menu says that something is \""topped with\"", they mean that they give you a sample for half your order. The fries they gave me were obviously the last of the basket short stubby bits and as such were poorly cooked. I couldn't believe that they would actually serve that to someone. \n\nThankfully they have at least one thing that can help to cover up their awful food. Their beer selection is very good (if you can manage to find a beer that they haven't run out of), so get enough beer to dull your taste buds."
1,"Ok, I just want to say, the guy behind the counter says they are not the same people who owned the one on T-bird. This place is identical to the old one. I'm smelling something fishy here or these people bought the name and concept before the old place went under. I am sitting here waiting for my food so I will give an update on how good this one is.\nOk, I had my tamales and everything else I ordered that night and I have to say, not half as good as the old one. Sorry but its true. I used to go buy tamales every Christmas at the one on T-bird and they were fantastic. The tamales I bought from this one were dried out and bland. I threw most of them away. I dont think I will be coming back for anymore tamales or anything else for that matter."
1,"First of all i don't really understand why I was charged full price ($3.75) for a small chocolate cappuccino and given only half of a cup?! (see picture). I also don't see any reason to pay almost $3 for a cup of tea while you can get exactly the same one in Starbucks for $1.50\nEmployees were neither rude nor super friendly.  I would say kind of pretentious just like the rest of the clientele that come to this place. \nMy cranberry muffin was really fresh, tasty (and expensive )."
1,"Terrible service.\n\nI recently visited this establishment and and was very disappointed. The service was terrible: the every single employee was pushy and rude. I had a hard time getting my receipt. When I finally got it, the receipt for the service was given to me, however I never received a copy of my credit card receipt. When i was given my car back, the tire light on the dashboard was still on. I had to drive back into the shop and ask them why the light was still on. Nobody had any clue what to answer or how to get the light to turn off. It was a freakin' hassle. \n\nI had a terrible experience. With so many tire shops in town, I will never go back to this Discount Tire or any other one."
1,"This place is awful.  I bought a package for massages which they have refused to honor and refuse to refund my money.  They either double book, don't show up or show up late.  Do not go here."
1,"If I could give the new Pei Wei zero stars I would. Decided to give it one last try and it was even worse than before. Tried the Honey Seared Chicken and it was the most dry dish I've ever had. It also had no flavor, which is one thing that kept me going back to the old Pei Wei. We also tried a salad, but it basically only tasted like the little tangerines pieces in it. I guess I should've known this was a bad place when they completely eliminated the kids menu. Oh, and putting everything in to-go dishes just seems so wasteful! I won't return here ever again."
1,"I never even made it into this salon--I wanted to try it--I really did.  I called to let the stylist know that I had found them online and wanted to get pricing on a shampoo, cut, and style.  While I did get the pricing, the woman acted like being on the phone with a potential new client was the LAST thing she wanted to do.\n\nI asked her if she does Saturday appointments, she responded \""Yes we do,\""...silence...silence...silence...silence--you get the point. I'm thinking O-k, guess you're not going to ask if I want to make an appointment. I thanked her and ended the call.\n\nI have always had a good rapport with my stylist, and it started with the first call.  First impressions are lasting and the impression she gave me was that I needed to try another salon!"
1,"This place has THE WORST customer relations I've experienced in Pittsburgh since I moved here two months ago. My boyfriend was about to order a gyro, I was waiting for him at the table outside near the street with a drink and hotdog I had gotten elsewhere, there was absolutely no one else in their establishment. The person behind the counter then told my boyfriend that I was not welcome to sit at their outdoor seating area with him while he enjoyed his gyro. He canceled his order and we sat at the friendly place next door. Not only did Knossos lose my boyfriend's business that day, but they also lost both of us as future customers. What a petty and pathetic place."
1,"Not So Good... Half star ... \n\nWhat can I say about Arribas Mexican Grill. Let's start on a positive note.  The staff is warm, friendly, and extremely personable, which is why I feel horrible for saying their Mexican Food is bland and tasteless. \n\nI really wanted to like Arribas Mexican Grill. After all I had been to the Phoenix location and the food wasn't bad. However, the way to begin a meal is not with a watery tomato salsa and a puny bowl of broken chips. \n\nI have to give Arribas props for their cheese crisp. The cheese crisp was loaded with cheese and extra crispy. However, the enchiladas were soggy and brunt on the ends. Followed by  the overcooked rice and flavorless refried beans.\n\nNot the worst Mexican food on earth, but it is a contender."
1,"They have a great selection of both food items and beers.  Unfortunately, the food items aren't at all good, and the beer is on the pricey side.\n\nSpecifics: I had some unnecessarily soggy french fries, followed by a wrap surprisingly devoid of contents.  I was left hungry and feeling a little ripped off.  The person to my right ordered some buffalo chicken bites (like boneless wings).  They were served to her cold, and when she told the waiter, he took them back to the kitchen and brought them out just as cold but with more hot sauce on it (he might have told the chef \""make it hotter\""?).  Dessert was also overpriced, and didn't match the description on the menu.\n\nThat said, the staff was friendly and they do have quite a good selection, so it might be a decent option in a large group of picky eaters or drinkers."
1,Portions are small for the price and burgers are not that great. Service was not good. they shouldnt leave open kitchen to see them messing around while you wait for your food and the place is empty. Many better options if your craving a good burger.
1,4pm for check-in? No seriously ?No wifi access at all. You can even get a connection from circus circus from your room. Very old structure. Go to stratosphere for better service and rate.
1,"My boyfriend and I have always been fans of Arriba but they drove us away as customers. We hadn't been back for a few months because of how bad our service had been but the food and drink was usually worth it. Let me tell you that is now sub-par as well, aside from the Margarita that was for 2 and fairly priced, the waitress didn't card us and proceeded to call us Kid's/Kiddo's the remainder of our visit. I work in the restaurant industry and would NEVER serve Kid's or Kiddo's a Margarita for two. Also no waters were given to us until requested. I ordered the Carne Asada and it came out looking good, until I started actually eating it, the carne was piled on top of a HUGE slab of red cabbage, gross. The waitress asked my boyfriend if he wanted Guacamole and Sour Cream making it sound like it was included in his meal so he said sure, the bill came and $1.99 for sour cream, and $2.50 for guacamole.... Holy hell they don't even give you more than 3 tablespoons of the stuff. Concern for the customers wallet is not there and we just had her pay for it with her tip, I don't think I've ever done that to anyone before. I do not recommend this place to ANYONE, unless you're just going for drinks and some chips and salsa other than that avoid this place entirely if you enjoy good service, friendly atmosphere, and good food."
1,"They seem to pride themselves on prompt service, well it took him two days to get out to me. But that's not the problem. Soon as he gets to my house he sees I have a Genie garage door opener. First thing he says is \""Oh no why did you get a Genie? Those are garbage and total junk.\"" Kept on saying how much of a piece of crap it is. He says \""Oh you bought the worst opener possible.\"" He refused to even work on it because he doesn't like them. All I needed him to do is wire it up with the sensors and the opener button.  Rudest person I have ever met. If you want him to come and insult you about how stupid you were to buy something its the worst thing ever, than go with him. But if you don't like being insulted, definitely stay away from Affordable Garage Door and Opener repair."
1,"I've been a member here since they opened and I've come to the conclusion that this place sucks. I should have listened to my wife from the start but gave them to many chances. \nThere are no designated areas to stretch or do pilometrics. There are 200 lockers in the mens room and one six foot bench to sit on, ONE!  If there is more than 2 guys in there you have to sit on in like some sort of men's gay rowboat team to fit. They don't allow outside equipment, meaning you can't jump rope or use resistance bands. And they offer no classes or education.\nAt first glance its seems like a sweet deal. Low monthly fees and no contracts. They still ding you on annual membership and cancellation fee, which averages out to the same as 24hr, LA Fit, and Gold's. Katie the manager also couldn't explain how my card was double dinged on fees and offered no remedy. This experience irritated me so much I paid the extra $25 cancellation fee to never come here again.\nThat's right, I would rather become fat and out of shape, shaving years off my life, rather than step foot in this gym again."
1,"This place is so poorly managed and aweful, it's difficult to make an emphasis. They just don't care about their service. At all... So odd..."
1,"Myself and my wife have been going to Famous Dave's before they came to Henderson. We have traveled to both the Rainbow and Blue diamond location before the Henderson  one was built. We USE to like to go twice a week, now, we will probably go back to our old place: Memphis BBQ. We just went the other day, to Dave's, Tuesday and wouldn't you know they \""took away\"" the everyday specials and the catfish!!  No more Big Rib Tuesdays, Beef it up Wednesday's, wing specials, ect...\""Thanks Dave\""!!  just like the rest of the money hungry restaurants here in Vegas and Henderson!!  Tease people for a few months and then........\""BAM!!  take away the specials. What you get now is a small bowl of crusty, burnt, three day old wannabe potato chips that I would not give to a homeless person. That's typical, we've  all seen it before and will continue to see it later.  Hey here's a little side note. Have you ever seen \""ALL\"" of these places closing up due too GREED??? I know we have and if they keep going the way they are they will fall right in behind the rest. This \""WAS\"" a nice place to go and eat fairly cheep. But now....better keep drivin by. Your best bet is to go to Memphis BBQ.  At least Mike Mill's has his daily specials!!!!!  They have been here in Vegas WAY longer than Famous Dave's has.  Good luck, Dave!!"
1,"I used to eat here and drink teas, but this morning there is one server (staff) named Yi..was very mean, rude, unprofessional.  Very bad service. ..I was.asking about bobba tea menus...apparently I didnt quite hear what she says because of the loud music in the store, that she has to repeat her response, then she just rolled her eyes and says \"" you know what im saying\"" as if like im stupid. Then she talks to one of the staff in taiwanese and looking at me...like  as if I dont understand....I would not recommend this anymore to my friends and family..Rude server...pls be aware of that girl named Yi...bad customer service..."
1,"Kams. Smells like a hamster cage in serious need of a bedding change. Drinks are totally average, albeit cheap. The first place townies and U of I students go when they turn 19, most of whom regret it."
1,"This is the worst Wendy's I've been too !!!\nThe food comes out nasty looking, smashed, looks like it's been sitting for a while.....fries are either cold or way over salted!!!\ncashiers are to busy flirting with the boys that come in.\nSeems management doesn't care either.....\nRestrooms are always dirty at every visit I've been there.\nLast time I went.......about Sept of 2010, never going back."
1,"I swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed. The background music playing was very loud and quite difficult to place my order to the owner who was also holding a conversation with a non-patron at the same time. \n\nBased on the pictures in the menu I decided to try their 1/3 lb beef burger........ what I got was a thin frozen patty that was still raw in the middle and dripping with grease, (disgusting)! I had them make another and this too was dripping. The seasoning was off and not tasty at all. \n\nAs for the fries, well these are your standard frozen seasoned fries you can get at any grocery store. There is absolutely no chance of us ever going back to Flame Burger.\n\nMy advise- miss the driveway and swing into Jack in the Box."
1,Terrible.  Sticky interior.  Incorrect order.  Orange chicken that tasted like they used a ketchup glaze.  Kung pao chicken was all the right ingredients just no flavor or spice.  I didn't finish my egg roll.  Crab puffs were the best part of the meal.  Will not go back.
1,"I would give this store no stars if I could. Sales representatives do not even acknowledge your existence when you walk in. They are incompetent with the technology and simply direct you to Apple, the customer service number or literally any resource they can to avoid giving any sort of effort."
1,"This vet clinic just wants $$$$. My dog is on optimmune which I used to get at this clinic for around $35. Then they increased their prices and it's now $60!!!!  My dog is also on rimadyl, one tablet every  2 months when she goes to the groomer.  I requested a refill but I needed  get blood work done since it should be done every 6 months while on the medication.  I  thought this was ridiculous since in a 6 month duration, my dog only consumes 3 pills.  She doesn't use it daily like other dogs. I stated that to the vet and she responded that a test needs to be done before a refill."
1,"If the experience couldn't get worse. It did! I go in for my follow up to my angiogram and expect to just see the doctor and go on my way. I'm informed I have to do another EKG. They hook me all up only to tell me to take my bra off. So they have to unhook me from the machine. They did say I could have one of those crappy paper gowns, but If your a larger girl you know those things never fit! So off came my bra and I laid back down. Now during this time 3 other nurses came in and out of the room opening the door enough that anyone walking by could see in. I'd really rather not display my \""girls\"" for all to see. Not to mention it's steaming hot in the room. So I'm sweating my bum off while they are telling me to relax. They obviously had none of my information from the hospital cause they asked me what the results were of my angiogram. They proceeded to ask me a lot of questions I figured they would have already had and then said the doctor would be in soon. There we waited for 20 more heat sweltering minutes until finally Dr. Chanderraj came in. \n\nI'm happy everything ended up being ok. I never want to have to come back to this location again! I hope if your reading this you don't have to go either!"
1,"Horrible! We were excited to eat here because of the name. However, the hot dogs were dried out and disgusting, buns were dry, and there are no refills on soda. I would suggest walking a couple of doors down to the burger joint."
1,They charged us $250 for someone smoking next door to us.  Beware of them because they will screw you as well.
1,"Our server was awesome but the food was horrible, and what I mean by that is it wasn't very sanitary. I ordered a baked potato and when I was spreading my butter I noticed something hard and black in it. My husband took it out and cracked it open and it seemed to be a hard piece of mold. Management insisted that it was a burnt piece of steak and it obviously wasn't, i'm not too sure how a burnt piece of steak would end up in a container of butter, and besides, why would they allow anything to do with meat around dairy products during preparation, wouldn't that be a type of cross-contamination?? Never will I eat at this restaurant again, and I feel maybe they should be visited by a health inspector."
1,"First impression when I walk into the place is the smell of dirty carpets. Gross! We get seated right away. Usually it takes forever since everyone in the area seems to like Olive Garden?! \nSo it took 10 minutes to get our drinks, then almost another 50 minutes to get our entr\u00e9es. The food in my opinion is so commercial. I really don't get why people come here so often. I guess everyone is so used to their McDonalds and microwave dinners. \n I ordered the cheese ravioli with tomato sauce. I literally could taste the package it came out of! There is nothing fresh about Olive Garden, not even the salad, which is soaked in house dressing and stale croutons. Other than the food which was lacking, so was the service. Our waitress took forever to refill drinks and notice the obvious things which we needed. \nThe only reason why I came here, was because it was my niece's bday dinner and she wanted to try it. I really don't miss this place nor will I ever crave anything here."
1,"This place used to be good when Hector owned and operated it.  At that time they also had competent staff.  It has recently with the past few years turned over many many times.  It seems to get worse each time I give it another try.  Their bagels are pretty good when they have them but often the service experience and the lack of inventory makes you want to jump through the glass window.  By the time my church lets out on Sunday they are usually down to the weird bagels and no sesame or poppy.  If there are more than two people in front of you when ordering, just run like hell."
1,"The only thing good here is probably the pizza.  But again the portions was too small. This was the worst nachos I ever had. I especially ordered double cheese toppings on the nachos but never received an empty plate like this one, toppings on the nachos were invisible. Should have take a picture for you folks. Fried calamari and chicken wings was served at room temperature. The fried calamari was disgusting as the fried was wet &  mushy. We were having our office happy hour there on the third floor maybe that's why everything was served cold lol... I should have not reserved here and follow advice from my girlfriend and colleagues that this place's food sucks really bad. I usually don't review restaurant but this one needed to be pointed out. It's just good for drinks..."
1,I have never posted a review before. This place is so bad it made me post. Worst customer service in the valley.
1,"Came here for lunch while staying at the Venetian.  Three of the four of us who at here had upset stomachs afterward.  I guess you can try your luck, though."
1,"I just finished eating my take-out dinner from CRMG on Camelback.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there is a lot of food left, unfortunately it's in the trash can.\n\nWhat I noticed behind the counter was a lot of confusion among way too many high school employees.  It looked like they opened last week, yet they opened at least 6 months ago.\n\nI used CRMG online ordering tool.  That worked.  I ordered the beef nachos and a beef burrito.\n\nWhen I dug into my nacho's I didn't like that there was barely any cheese.  Also, they seem to use cheddar which once it cools changes your nachos to NACHO.  Impossible to separate.\n\nI gave up on the nachos quickly - no flavor and a pain to eat.  Time for the burrito.\n\nWhat the burrito lacked in flavor, it made up for in size.  What flavor was there, was not what I expected.  I ordered with a medium verde salsa - which it appeared to have - but it also had some kind of enchilada sauce.  The two combined to be inedible.  I ate less than 20% of the burrito before trashcanning it.\n\nAll in all, it was a wasted $18.50\n\nUnder no circumstances can I envision a return."
1,"Im an avid foodnetwork guru and always wondered why Boby was so cocky. Apparently he has to be since his food is not so great which must be the reason why he always gets beat on Throwdown. Not authentic and super mediocre flat out bland.\n\nMy husband had the Mesa burger which was super dry and didnt even finish. I had thespicy chicken + sweet potato hash was way over priced and more like a meal from denny's\n\nCame here during super bowl 2010, maybe they were too busy? not sure I'd ever come back."
1,So we just had their hotdogs and once we finished we went to the front to throw away our trash that's when we saw it!  We love our hot dogs with onions and the cashier at the food court was cleaning the onion and condiment area with this nasty looking rag.  We were glad he was cleaning up but then he gather all the onions on the counter with this rag and puts it back into the onion machine for all the customers to consume.  Oh my GOD!  I wanted to puke!  Don't eat there or at least don't eat their onions unless you want to get sick.  My mom was feeling ill that whole day.  It's just soooo gross.
1,"The worst case of customer service ever. I have came here often and its horrible. The staff has the worst attitude, it takes extremely long and they don't pay attention"
1,"I had dinner at The Carnegie Deli on 8/6/13 (check no.5070620; should management need validation).\n\nThe service was great, the restaurant was clean (and looked much like something you would see in NY), sandwiches and sides were fresh and delicious. The salad inparticular was fresh as it gets. The vegetables were crunchy (great cucumbers). Great rye bread too. I would go back for the sandwiches - because I'm flying out in late August.\n\nAs far as the desserts go...\nI ordered the coconut cream pie and my guest ordered the seven layer cake.\nThe coconut cream pie was beautiful, but the flavor wasn't there at all. The pie was starchy (probably from too much corn starch) and lacked that creaminess and 'coconut flavor' that one expects from this classic. I used to make these pies for a resort in Saipan and the right recipe will give you great results every time. It's not a difficult dish to pull off. Anyway, Carnegie's pie lacked so much dimension that I wondered if anyone working there ever stopped to say, \""Can we really standy behind this coconut cream pie\""? are they testing their desserts? I doubt it.\n\nI tried my friends seven layer cake. Way too sweet and VERY dry. I could tell that the cake was either old or it was stored at a temperature so cold that it actually damaged the genoise cake part of the dessert.\n\nCarnegie is great for sandwiches and sides, but hey should just burn the dessert menu."
1,"I recently stayed here for the first time. Instead of writing a paragraph here is are some reasons why my stay here was let's just say less than perfect:\n\n-unfriendly staff, seems like no body likes their job here...\n-cleanliness of room was a disappointment\n-no early check in, you must pay a fee, and after you pay this fee don't be surprised if they put you in an unclean room only to have to move you \n-security guards take their jobs way to serious\n-pool is crowded w no seats and limited cabanas\n\npositives:\n-cheap, but I guess you get what you pay for\n-centrally located\n-margarita ville"
1,"Horrible,  horrible,  horrible.  No minibar, no luggage rack, dirty.  As an independent female traveler, very unsafe. Gum in the peephole. Drain backed up in shower. Horrible place. Will Never stay there again."
1,"While I agree the online reservation is easy.  I had a bad experience overall.  First, it's easiest to pay with a swiped credit card rather than entering all information online.  Then the shuttle schedules you way too early for your ride.  In my experience in Pittsburgh, the shuttle came almost 20 minutes early.  I received a 4:47 am call say, \""your supershuttle ride will be there in ten minutes.  Out of courtesy to other passengers, please be ready.\"" my scheduled time for pick up was 6:15-6:30!  What was most obnoxious was no other rider was waiting!  \n\nThen it was pouring, and the driver wouldn't even get out of his car to open my door or help with my bag.\n\nThen we ended up waiting almost 15 minutes picking up the next passenger, because we were so early!!!!\n\nWould not recommend! Take a cab!"
1,"3$ for brown rice! A rip off!  I ordered basil shrimp and got mint shrimp instead.  The rice came midway through my entree after asking twice for the brown rice.  One it arrived, it was dry and smelled old."
1,"We went there Motzi Shabbos 12/25/2010, with my son, daughter-in-law and their two children.  I went to ask to clear messy tables so we could sit down and eat. I was informed that they would only do take out.  When you are in a hotel, it is hard to do take out and have warm food.  The waiter asked me if we wanted food to go.  Before I had a chance to answer, he gave a sigh and walked away from me.  I will never step foot there again and tell anyone who asks for kosher food in Las Vegas, not to go there."
1,"This place has terrible service. Our waitress was the worst! No eye contact when greeting us. Hardly checked on us. There were 9 of us & our food was delivered in spurts. I'm giving it 1 star because the food was good, once it got there."
1,"Horrible, Horrible Horrible..\n\nIm from california, drove all the way out here to find out why my grandfather was rushed to emargency, and didnt find out until 2 hours after doctors and nurses passed by me.  \n\nThis place is the Martin Luther King hospital from L.A,\n\nIn l.a. we call it \""killa-King\"" because not too many patients make it out"
1,"The worst service ever. And I'm not a rude person, at all. I said \""please\"" and \""thank you.\"" And I absolutely was not greeted whatsoever. Whoever that dumbass lady was, that was working needs to take that stick out of her. Don't be mad at me 'cause you hate YOUR job, bitch. Let's not forget that everyone is REPLACEABLE, including your miserable self. It took every bit of me not to cuss her out. I'd write a letter to corporate but she did not give me a receipt. Go figure right. I'm not one to talk down on people that works fast food because it's not in my character to knock someone's hustle. But she really needs to get it together. And for that, I will NOT ever return to this McDonald's ever again. Some bullshit. Oh. And. Not only did I not get a receipt... I didn't get a straw. And instead of 10 piece chicken nuggets, I got 9. What in the fucking fuck..... Fuck that McDonalds."
1,"If you want to drive from Los Angeles to spend time in a Section 8 property, good luck to you. Front Desk told me that the rooms are going to be remodeled\nDon't rent this room out then!!!"
1,"I have been here several times for my families pictures and loved that I could buy the package and then have access to the online studio for my family to buy more prints that I couldn't afford of my son. Well after our visit there today I will never go back. I went to get my sons second birthday pictures done and like usual I picked the favorite pose for the packet and then I assumed like the other 5-6 times I've been there, that the rest of my favorites would be available on the site for my parents to buy more sheets of the other poses, BUT no! At the end of everything, they inform me that the studio online is not available if you don't buy more poses upfront anymore. And only the additional poses you do buy are available on the site. So really if you get down to 10pictures you LOVE you have to buy atleast one sheet of every pose to be able to get them all online as well. Which would be several hundreds of dollars which I for one do not have. I am extremely disappointed that I lost so many amazing pictures of my baby boy because they no longer offer that option and my family could not buy more.... I will never go back...."
1,"I went here today with high hopes of finding a cat to adopt. After looking at cats i decided to wonder over to look at the dogs.. No harm in that. Maybe id even take one of them babies home today! Well, i was in there wondering around for about a half hour with no help whatsoever and people walking past me just looking at me like i was an alien. All of the workers were standing around under a tent gossiping and not doing anything the whole 1 1/2 hrs i was looking at dogs. I finally walked up to ask for help to which everyone just stood there and stared at me then SO EXCITINGLY helped me look at a dog. He said but 4 words to me and took off back to the tent to gossip more. Then i walk up to return the dog and once again everyone stares at me and gives me dirty looks for inturrupting the chat session. A bunch of the dogs said 'I need walked' on their cages yet only the volunteers were walking. Everyone that actually worked there was standing around. What a shame. I must say i feel bad for the dogs there. Everyone else ive encountered there was OK but the dog adoption.. Lets just say i was very upset when i left. I wont be going back which is a shame.. The people working there could probably adopt out way more dogs if they were actually friendly and helped out"
1,"Food-wise, the lo mein is good. The fried rice is oily and flavorless. The sushi is okay depending on the rolls.\n\nService-wise: We went to VIP for my birthday. My parents put a $7 tip under a plate. After we left and went to the parking lot already, the server chased us down, told my mom to follow her. The server lead my parents back to where we ate. She asked if she served us well. My mom replied yes. Then she asked, \""Why didn't you guys leave me a tip?!\"" My mom replied that they had put it under the plate. She lifted up the plate and found the tip. My mother gave her another $10 after that in case that wasn't enough."
1,I could not have been less impressed with the hostile and unprofessional attitude of everyone I encountered at Hastings and Hastings.  \nLearn from my mistake and don't bother calling these people.
1,"The club is great...IF you get in. The bouncer here is a effing asshole. Unless you're a girl, tall, thin, and look like a slut, you most probably won't get in. It's filled with guido juice heads or underaged kids that look 30. But I guess that's the only thing the guido bouncer can relate to. And he's rude. And has a small dick complex. Maybe he didn't get into Police Tech and is stuck being 40 and a bouncer?"
1,"My visit to this place was not only disappointing, but it made me sad to think that this place would probably go the way of Planet Hollywood in a year or two. I had the Carnitas and I had to cut (or should I say SAW) into it with a knife and fork. My friend's crab enchiladas were underwhelming. I was heartbroken that yet another famous Latino is slapping his name on a \""brand\"" that will probably fail instead of actually checking out the food and making sure it's edible. Very beautiful decor, and nice (but not terribly sharp) staff is about the only thing I can say about this one."
1,I CAN'T be certian but i'm almost POSTIVE I got sick for over 24 hours from this POPEYES went in side and saw a cock roach on the wall and I was so hungry I still ate the food and got SICK! Also the bathrooms were a shit show LITTERALLY! EW DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS POPEYES!!!!!!
1,"0 STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nWORSE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT COMPANY I HAVE ENCOUNTERED!!!!!!!!!\n\nI am a RENTER and it takes an act of congress to get these people to send someone out, then it takes a second act of congress to have these clowns that they hire to actually fix the issues!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nEVERY RENTER on 10th Place has had nothing but bad things to say about this company.\n\nMy dishwasher has been broke and leaking for over 2 months and they have not taken any initiative to fix it.\n\nOur A/C unit, which is too small for our unit size, has been leaking INSIDE THE HOUSE and they have no urgency to fix this after repeated calls. \n\nI WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND AVOIDING THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"The people of Walmart buffet!  An endless parade of oversized people serving themselves oversized portions of unhealthy, poor quality, poorly prepared food.  The ambiance matched Walmart including the Degrazia Babies with dirty snot stained faces running around in bare feet with a diaper swaying between their knees overfilled with urine. Cheesy music is regularly interrupted with a PA system of management barking orders at the employees. Dirty floors and greasy food encrusted black stained carpets. Wall to wall horrible."
1,Boring. This place was dead and they still wanted to charge a cover fee. Their service is awful even with the place completely empty. It took them 30 minutes to bring our order. The security guys are a bunch of losers. With their little power they act like bullies. I put my head down for a second. Wasn't sleep or anything. Just rested it on the table. Get told I can't sleep in there. Not my fault this place is lame.
1,"All I can saw is Ewwh.... we went here during a Sunday afternoon...we thought it would be a little cheaper at the tables, not it was the same here maybe $5-$10 instead of $10-$20, but still..I think I got a disease from the icky seats at Fitzgerald's....not going back here."
1,"DO NOT GO HERE or believe their prices on the phone. They lie. Quoted 118.99 for a cat spay told them I was needing 2 cats done. They told me $240 for both, I questioned whether or not that includes pain medication and was told yes. Made the appointment and dropped off cats in the morning. Was also told if they were in heat it would be more which I said no problem one was 6 months old the other is over a year. When we picked up our animals they cost had gone up with the explaination of we weree told it 286.00 for the 2 cats and they were both in heat. Called several vets all said 6 months old is impossible to be in heat. Even if I paid the additional for them both being in heat the price was still $37.00 more than that. The doctor was very friendly and offered to give 1/2 back in credit for his employee lying to me or misunderstanding as it was put. I was not complaining about the money I wanted them to be fair and stick to their quote they didn't I will pay another vet to remove the sutures from my cats and never retun to this clinic. If you choose to use them in the future get it in writing before you book a appointment. Good luck Adobe doctor seemed nice but kinda hope staff tanks you if your smart enough to stop them."
1,Saturday hours 9am opening. Sat outside for 25minutes past 9am i was not alone there was about 10 other people. We all left because no body showed to open store! Second time I came to this location. First time had horrible customer service. Was yelled at for coming in the store a hour and half before closing. Will not recommend this place to anyone!  Ace hardware is the place i will be going until i find a better hardware location
1,"I went to this PostNet location to mail two letters, certified mail.  There was no line, but it took over 10 minutes for the gentlemen to complete my very simple transaction.  I was charged over $11.00 per letter - one of which needed to be mailed to a Phoenix address.  The post office charges approximately $6.00 for each of the letters I mailed.  The mark-up at this place is outrageous.  When I asked why the mark-up was so excessive, I was told that it was worth paying for the short wait.  10 minutes for two letters - Give me a break.  I will not be returning."
1,"This location needs work. The food line is a cluster, they are all over the place. You need to watch them because they forget things. Soup was cold, tortilla was cold. They have 3 different kinds of tea and they were all empty! Annoying. I keep thinking they will get better but im disappointed every time."
1,"I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone for one reason. \""PATHETIC CUSTOMER SERVICE\"". They really don't care about their customers as they know they are one of the very few Indian restaurants in Madison.  Food is very ordinary and they cheat on their timings. They mention they are open till 10, but stop taking people and orders by 9:30. Let them rather put they are open only until 9:30. They need to learn proper business etiquette. People come for food and they just turn them down without any kind of considerations. I hope we get better restaurant in Madison and we avoid going there."
1,"Super cute little place, so much so that I took a pic and sent it to my fiance. I went fo lunch on a Saturday while on my lunchbreak. I was quickly seated as there was only one other group there. Ordered and ice tea to find they only have the raspberry nestea. Was pleasantly surprised when I was given a basket of garlic bread, but it was grossly oily.. alas, I ate them all because it took 30 miniutes for my eggplant parmesan sandwich to arrive. Since I had to get back to work, I asked for it to go. The guy who brought it to me in a bag had to return to the kitchen to ask when I asked what I owed. The owner or manager came out and charged me full price for my sandwich and tea which I thought was rude considering I waited 30+ mins before I had to leave and asked for it to go. Meanwhile my tea was empty...  Aet my sandwich at my desk at work, it was just so-so.\nI wont be back"
1,"Bad, rude and racist service at the ticket window from an employee that told us \""we couldn't return movie tickets.\"" Then the supervisor comes and say's \""that the transaction never got charged on our gift card and the money couldn't be put back on it anyway\"" They eventually gave us \""free tickets\"" for the trouble with a bad attitude. After the movie was done, I went on my phone and screen shot a picture of the transaction that they did in fact charged us with the wrong amount to it, so that I could show them that they were wrong and that on top of their horrible service and bad attitudes, they \""free movie tickets\"" they gave us weren't free and we were still over charged. It's sad how horrible the service and management has gone down here since AMC took over this place. A bad service experience has completely changed my mind about this location being my favorite movie theater. Never again."
1,"I will never go there again.\nI dropped off my beige and blue comforter to be dry cleaned and when I got it back all the blue was bleached out of it!  When I asked to be refunded my money she said \""I don't believe there was any blue in it.  I would have remembered.\""  SO... I said I would drive all the way home to get my matching pillows, which I did.  At that point she said, \""Well, in that case it must be the manufacturers fault.  You obviously brought me something that was \""un-dry cleanable.\""  What?  I was at a loss for words.  I showed her the tag that said \""Dry Clean Only.\""  She's like, well, I don't have to refund you because it's the manufacturer's fault.  She finally Did refund me, but it was a huge ordeal and I have a ruined bedspread now.  Also, they are SUPER expensive.  I was definitely not happy with my experience."
1,"Not impressed with these scam artists. I went to The Range at Ballantyne for the first time yesterday. After I got checked in and watched the safety video, I had to wait 10 minutes while they figured out which lane another customer was on so they could charge him. It was like watching the three stooges use a computer for the first time. Once I got on the range, I was happy to find that it was state of the art and had a good 30 minute shooting session using a pistol. Then the bait and switch happened. It is supposed to be $19/hr pistol, $25/hr rifle. When I was rung up, it came up as $25/hr. They said because I used FMJ I was charged the rifle rate. Pistols rate is only allowed if you use Total Metal Jacket (TMJ). Not once was this brought up until it was time to pay. Because they only allow full hour sessions and after tax, my 30 minutes of shooting pistol cost $27!!! NEVER AGAIN!"
1,1st of all this gym is filthy and dirty and the machines are always broken. The basketball courts bring thugs and garbage there. My car was broken into there and my wallet was stolen and there is no security there. The staff is rude and not helpful. I'm at lvac and is a lot better.
1,I would never use these people ever again when visiting the charlotte area. They are rude and their communication levels are unprofessional. Tried to pay them several times by calling bc their website payment plan wouldn't hold up. They never returned my phone calls till months later after I had terminated their services when they noticed the debt. Not very responsible and also made very difficult to keep up my end of the contract. I also found them to be way over priced and not compensating their employees appropriately for all the hard work that they do. If I were you I would find better business people.
1,Not only was Angelo's Italian lemon water ice awful but they also had the nerve to charge a BLEEPING ten dollars for our two cups. We tossed them in the garbage after one spoonful.\n\nVery artificial in taste with an odd texture and very expensive.
1,We wanted to come here with a group and they were far less than accommodating. They claimed our wait time to be 20 minutes and we waited for over an hour. They refused to join tables and spoke to us like we were an inconvenience. Very disappointed with this place.
1,"DO NOT GET MARRIED HERE! This resort is beautiful from the outside, but start peeling back the layers and you will see an ugly company that will nickle and dime you at every turn. My wedding experience turned from one of joy and happiness to a feeling of dread and nausea at every turn with this company.  THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW UP FRONT: Expect to pay a 22% service charge that is TAXED with the sales tax + the regular sales tax on top of your bill. Also, plan to spend $100 per bartender and be expected to tip several key people during the reception, despite the service charge. Also, plan to pay $4.00 per every car that valets at your wedding. If you want a list of who actually used the valet, forget it. Expect to meet every deadline they give you with your payments, but do not expect such promptness from them. And if you use their \""preferred vendors,\"" remember who some of those vendors really work for at the end of the day... I have my contract on record for anyone who wants a glimpse at the \""whole picture.\"" Trust me when I say that the beautiful, sugary sweet image you get on your initial visit, will not depict the financial reality here."
1,"Went with a group of friends for a birthday party. Sat at the open couches, played some games, had some beers. About 30 minutes later we got kicked out of our spots because a group of people that were \""spending more $ than us\"" wanted those couches. Seriously. Will not go back."
1,"My wife and I went in around lunch time. There was literally no one there and no one acknowledged that we were there for several minutes. There was only one item in the entire glass case. We stood around awkwardly until we saw the laminated menus in the holder on the wall. \n\nWe decided to try a juice before we ate so I ordered a carrot-orange juice. It was about $5 and came out luke-cold. I felt pretty disappointed at that point to we left. \n\nIt is a really cool looking place but the service and food seemed really sub-par, especially for the price. I see a lot of positive reviews so I may try this place again but my time there was definitely a 1-star experience."
1,"Wow! So first of all their stuff is overpriced, criminally overpriced.  Second all they do (pretty much all pawn shops FYI) is look up eBay prices and offer you like 25% of what they could sell it for on eBay. Even knowing that this place fails hard.\n\n$100 offer for iPhone 5c with all the accessories. What a joke."
1,"The service is the worst I have ever received in any restaurants in Vegas (or anywhere else  for that matter)...Nobody on the serving staff was smiling...with their dark colored uniform...you feel that you attending a funeral, not a dinner...when I was there...it was apparent everybody there was forced to wait for a very long time for their food...Guess what did the servers do?  No apology...just avoided eye contact or gave you a dirty look...They made it very clear: they hated their jobs and would rather be doing something else....They need some serious training on what the word hospitality means!"
1,"Astonished!  Been eating their delivered pizzas for 8 yrs, Good pies~ but this time they made a mistake and wrote down pick up.  Hour later I called, got brash woman (owner!) Who told me it was my mistake~  I asked if they would deliver, but hoped for a fresh pie~  whoa  - absolutely not!  \nWhen I asked how we could compromise,  she said she was deleting the order. Well ok I guess.\nI even called back to speak with manager (that's how I figured out she was owner)  and she absolutely didn't care about my 8 yrs of loyalty.\n\nSad for them, she probably wonders why her little junky restaurant is not very successful~  and I'll tell a hundred Mt holly people about it because communities don't support business owners who do this ~ all of this over a 12 dollar pizza, pretty pathetic huh?\nKelly.  Mt Holly, NC"
1,"I went to this place for a lunch buffet on a Saturday.\nEverything from the appetizers to the dessert was stale, probably a few days old. \nThe quality was pathetic and had a lot of potential to make you really sick. The Naan was visibly stale, let alone the taste of it. I shall not go there again."
1,"Normally I roll by here late night for a quick bite and have no issues.  This morning at about 4:45 am I rolled by the drive through and they were closed.\n\nThe sign on the window says they are open 24 hours, but from what i experienced today, I guess not.  The female on the drive through intercom said they were closed.  I've never had issues like this here before.  \n\nMaybe I should call the 1-800-955-JACK number to confirm the hours of operation?"
1,"This is for the very rude security guard inside the club.\n\nThanks for being the rudest, most un-gentlemen like person I have ever had to encounter.\n\nThanks for pulling and grabbing my wrist so hard, and yelling at me, a girl, because the place was so crowded that you thought I was pushing. \n\nF YOU, douche bag!"
1,The worst service I have ever had and we were the only people in there! Chicken was burnt and had to scream at the waitress to ask her to fix it!!!! Could not pay me to go back!!!!
1,"Thirty minute wait just to be told that we'd have to wait an hour or two to get a car. Classy way to run a car rental business, with a garage completely full of cars."
1,"Stopped in here today and figured I would give it a try as I pass it all the time. First thing is the smoking section is right in front of the place so you have to walk through it to get inside. I get splitting migraines from cigarette smoke so I had to hold my breath. once in side there was a sign saying please seat your self.  so we did and figured they did not see us come in because it took for ever to get service. the booth was dirty, and the window sill had a inch layer of dust, with some old fries and about five dead flies on it. it took forever for the food to come, which is odd because there was only five people in the place and three outside smoking. the food was nothing to brag about just plain bleh. Not sure how they stay in business must have cheap drink on the lounge side and if you are wasted you don't care about the rest. place should shut down."
1,"I would again after 2 days of repeated problems warn all busy professionals or anyone who wants to partake of the freaky fast and freaky horrific service of jimmy johns to stay AWAY. The food is fine but beware that you will not get what you order. You will however get attitude, and poor service FREAKY FAST."
1,"Sadly, today I decided to review after a horrible experience yesterday. I went in because they have Blue Bell ice cream on sale for $3.98. I grab a vanilla and a no sugar added chocolate and head to the register. The vanilla rings up at $3.98 and the NSA chocolate rings up at $6.99. I told the cashier that must be a mistake. Another girl checks and tells me that NSA Vanilla is on the sale but the chocolate and strawberry are not????? WTF!!!! That is just ridiculous. I really like this store but pettiness like that will probably cause me to not shop there, ever again."
1,"Is this place still open? I guess if I look like Crockett or Tubbs I would hit this place in south beach, in 1984. I thought this place reeked of cheese. Believe me I came in without any preconceived notion or opinion. What I left with was the feeling of being had. How can someone from the West coast feel this is decent seafood. The fish as well as the pairings really sucked. Ok, I had some Fanny Bay oysters that were fine to start, but as they evening progressed I felt that this was becoming a waste of money. Did I mention the aquablue bolagnie decore?"
1,"I stopped in for lunch to check out this new pizza place. Mark Rich's NY Pizza and Pasta used to be here. I recognized the girl at the register when I walked in, so I asked her if they just changed the name, but she said that Mark Rich's recipes transferred over when the new owners bought the business in this location. Mark Rich's NY Pizza and Pasta still currently operates another location, using the same recipes and ingredients, but has nothing at all to do with Giani's NY Pizza and Pasta.\n\nI ordered the lunch special for $5.95 which was 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink. The pizza slices were a good size. I didn't care for the pizza though. They might be using the same recipe the previous owner used, but it doesn't mean it comes out the same and it just didn't for me. The pizza was somewhat burnt and had a stale taste to it like maybe it was from the day before. This is a real disappointment for me because I regularly shop in the shopping center Giani's is in and enjoyed stopping for pizza. Good thing \""Above the Crust\"" is just around the corner though on Ann Rd so there still is a solid pizza joint in the neighborhood I can go to."
1,"I'm big on customer service but this has the absolute WORST customer service I've ever experienced.  The neon looking guacamole was disgusting and the food was not even good. This place does not even deserve a star and I will not be returning.  Folks, give your well earned money elsewhere."
1,"Don't recommend this restaurant!  Napkins smelled!  Water glasses were dirty. Mine had something sticky on it.  The wall alongside me had stuff splashed and dried on the wall that wasn't cleaned up. The supposed Pacino's Amber ale was served in a ghetto Bud Light glass. My wife had a beer salad I could have thrown together better.  Service was good, but all in all, don't waste your money here.  D-vine or red-white-brew is much better."
1,"Worst Canadian Tire in Canada. They will NOT accept any return that wasn't bought in that store. What a concept. They have nothing. They have little inventory, and what they do have is crammed in tight with alleys 2 feet wide. Why bother. Drive to the 40 or Sherbrooke. You won't regret the drive."
1,"this place is expensive and not even good. its really busy, but i prefer not to eat at this place. because of the price... for 3 people it came out to like 48 dollars or something? WTH? \n\nNo Way... Thirty something i could have dealt with but 48? I kno that wasnt worth $48!\n\nPortions are small. The food isnt BAD... BUT NOT WORTH IT!!!!!"
1,"We ordered the shrimp lo mein and beef and vegetable dish. The lo mein has horrible, bland, no flavor even with extra sauce. The vegetables with the beef were raw. I never had such bad food at any other pei wei before"
1,"Okay food, semi-rude service. \n\nWe stopped in for a late dinner (~9.45pm) and the waiter happily welcomed us in. The food was alright, nothing special but not terrible either. Then, at 10.30pm, just as we were finishing our drinks, they turned the music off and turned on the lights - it was a strange way to basically kick us out, even though we had paid and were about to leave! 45 mins-an hour for dinner is not overly lengthy - if they didn't want to stay open, they could have simply said when we walked in the door."
1,This place sucks.....seriously.....I order 2 sandwich n a avocado smoothie. The house special and a char-chicken sandwich. It was not tasty at all n the bread was falling apart in our hand and the avocado smoothie is made of condense milk avocado and some sort of veggie....it was nasty....never again will I order from them.....EVER.....
1,"It was more like a small ferrari/Maserati dealership - the only info on the plaques were mileage and vehicle add-ons, etc. There were probably 15-20 cars available to see. No pics - super lame. The only person who talked to us was someone trying to get us to take a souvenir pic - for purchase of course.  It would've been nice if someone was there to provide some sort of historical perspective or some type of info.  I shoulda bought gelato instead."
1,"Very disappointed with the quality of the food. This is Vegas .. You expect more than sub par rubbery unseasoned filet ... Lobster risotto tasted like it came out of a bag, and the service left something to be highly desired . With all of the excellent food choices, do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. Came here on the myvegas comp first and last time."
1,"Such a disappointment!\n\nAfter reading all the sparkling reviews, I was hoping it would be a godsend to this organic eater, but unfortunately, it was not.  If I could give it  1.5 stars, I would...just on the basis of the only edible item I had: the urban cookie.  It was so-so.  The simple urban cookie was dry-- which seemed to be the theme of this bakery.   \n\nBought 2 Ollie cakes (cupcakes): chocolate/chocolate and the white cake with lemon frosting.  Both cakes were heavy and dry.  The lemon frosting was slightly pleasant.  The \""ganache\"" on top of the chocolate was like a big lump of frosting without any personality of its own other than of being chocolate.  \n\nBottom line: I spent nearly $9 and ended up dumping everything except the urban cookie.  Best organic cookies are made from scratch and the recipe on the Sunspire Organic Chocolate Chips bag if you use organic sugar which is crystallized.  Incredible!  \n\nOther than that, although they're not organic, I'll stick with Fry's and Honey Moon Sweets (sold at Whole Foods) for cakes."
1,"If I could put negative stars, I would. I never had a MAJOR issue with this place in the past, maybe a wrong order here and there but I learned to let it go. I hate complaining, but as a person who works in customer service, I really can't stand when people come to work with bad attitudes! \n\nI went here the other night after work and ordered through the drive thru. I order my usual carne asada fries and as I pulled up to pay, everything seemed fine. The lady working the drive thru was just so unpleasant. She had to reach a little bit harder to grab my card through the window, and she started shaking her head. I even took off my seat belt so I didn't have to make her reach out far. As she handed me my food, I then ask for red and green sauce, and she had the nerve to roll her eyes so far back that I was livid after she did that! As she handed me the sauce, I said to her, \""Are you really going to roll your eyes at me like that?\"" And she just walked away from the window. My blood was boiling and I wanted to go inside and complain, but figure that they wouldn't have done much about her attitude. Someone like that should NOT be helping people. What a joke!"
1,"Terrible, terrible, terrible! Don't believe the ad that advertises 5 rooms for $19.75...it is a scam! First thing the technician did was tell me how bad my house smelled and how awful my carpet looked (total exaggeration). NICE HUH! Then he proceeded to quote us a total of $273.00 to clean our smelly, awful carpet. We ended up agreeing on $70.00 and boy do I regret it! Well if my house had a slight smell before it was now 100 times worse...the whole house smells like wet, soggy, stale carpet...and that was with the deodorizer...I had my carpet cleaned 4 months ago by a different more reliable company and by the time they left my house  it smelled wonderful and fresh and clean! I only went with AZ carpet, upholstery and air duct  because of there advertisement. When I called to complain all they could tell me is that they would come and do a re-do...NO THANKS! My carpet is already soggy enough! I want a REFUND!"
1,"First visit: staff very loud  in communicating with each other. Food was good but dry had to use soup to try to bring some moisture to rice , chicken and egg rolls. May give it another try"
1,This buffet has gone up in price and down in quality. The food was horrible and there was barely anything to choose from. The place is dirty and we even found a hair in the food.
1,I used to love it here but not since new management. The old (great) nail techs left since the takeover and they haven't been the same since. My last visit was horrible. I wanted just a trim on my nails and she took all the length off. She then rushed the whole routine and didn't bother cleaning the sides. Clearly I will not be returning. \n\nOn a good note...I've found some of the old crew in the next parking lot over at TLC Nails.
1,Would rate a 0 if can. Had reservations and was seated right away but had to wait 30 mins just for drinks and over hr for food. service was horrible. restaurant wasn't even busy also.
1,"This was the WORST car rental experience I've ever had!!! Warning: do NOT patronize this agency...it feels like a scam. You wait in line for 2 hours then are informed that there are no more cars left, despite the fact that at least 30 more people are standing in line who all have reservations. This forces you to either go to another agency or take a taxi. Of course the other agencies cost much more, and I'd be willing to wager that the Dollar workers are getting a kick back from the business they generate for these other agencies. How is it they haven't been drummed out of business yet?"
1,"I went to visit my girlfriend while she was staying there for the Magic trade show.  The room seemed okay, nothing to nice.  But the carpets did seem dirty. And not to mention I had gotten bit from something while sleeping there.  My  girlfriend the next day even had to go to the ER with a bug bite that got infected.  The staff was pretty rude to her.  We will never go there again.  And we recommend that people use precaution if they do stay there.  You might end up with bug bites, and might have to get on antibiotics like my girlfriend did."
1,"Please do NOT go to this place for anything. The staff is a very sad and angry. The staff was very confused walking around the business aimlessly not trying to help or guide anyone around. First the person who was performing the smog test didn't know were to find the vin number didn't smile or even acknowledge that he was suppose to be helping us just walked right passed us while we wondered if him or one of the 3 other people standing around are going to help us. Then The manager came out and tryed to help but got frustrated while trying to smog my vehicle which is understandable because its an old car however he exploded a list of vulgar language, yelling and stomping like a small child because the car was having a hard time getting a read. Needless to say im very disappointed. Please go else were if you want quality work. I support small businesses but never again will I even walk in that place."
1,It is what it is....an off-price retailer of outerwear in the desert. \nGood prices for mediocre goods. I'd go to Ross first folks!
1,"I hate to be a Negative Nancy, but I just want to persuade people to run from this place. For one, food is way overpriced (my street taco platter and soda was over $10!), second, the food was sub par and relatively flavorless, and third, the environment of the restaurant was appalling (it seemed like people were living in the back). Other things to note: the salsa was watered down and flavorless, there are no napkins except the two they give you, and the food took forever to come out."
1,"Horrible outfit, purchased tickets on line ~ was under very short window to receive tickets and was requested to fax copy of credit card, my drivers license etc?? Received email that tickets were coming Fed-Ex, they never arrived. Told me to pick up at their office - told them to pound sand and was informed of some tiny small print.\n\nCharges were reversed (yeah Mastercard), crappy business that seems WAY shady to me!!!!"
1,"I must give this place one star.  I received a coupon in the mail two months in a row and finally decided to try it out.  First I went on Yelp to see reviews and found one glowing review, needless to say I was excited to try them out.  I get there and the woman behind the counter is on the phone, for me no big deal.  She then come around to help,  I let her know that I have a coupon for buy one dozen get one dozen free.  She informs me that it is only for cake doughnuts.  I say okay I won't use the coupon and just get a dozen asst. she then informs me that she will allow me to have one cream filled and one jelly, but I must purchase cake doughnuts!  I did not want cake, and would have wanted to choose my own flavors.  I told her never mind and would just go somewhere else.  Sadly, I did not even get to try the doughnuts!"
1,I was very excited to eat here since one of my friends said the good was delicious. So I drove there to see that the place was closed on a Wednesday in the middle of the day. The hours said 11-10 and no sign of why they were close at 3pm.... Disappointed.
1,"Worst hotel experience ever, do not come here during thanksgiving, the check in wait can be anywhere from 2-5hours. 15 check in counters with only 3 people doing check in. No care for customers and the worst customer retention strategy ever!"
1,"I attend movies at this theater, ONLY if I have no choice.\n\nYes, the theaters are spotlessly clean, the food and drinks are terrific, and the staff are polite and friendly beyond belief.\n\nSo why am I giving this place only ONE star?\n\nThe concessions are woefully overpriced and this place (unlike their competitors) offers NO SENIOR CITIZEN DISCOUNTS!\n\nCorrect those two things, and I would amend my review to give them FIVE stars."
1,"With two baristas, both waiting around for an other to be paid for (instead of making orders ahead of time) and cashiers scattering between fetching drinks and taking payments, no wonder there's a line!\n\nI've been to enough Starbucks to know that this is not how most are run. Mix that with the most processed looking baked goods I have ever seen at a Starbucks -- are these knockoff Costco pastries -- and you have yourself a pretty sad sight. \n\nWhen you expect something standard from a well-known brand, it feels like an even greater fall from grace when it all goes wrong."
1,"Wasn't impressed at all! If you are going to name yourself arrogant butcher you better make a good steak .....and they didn't, sadly. It was overbooked even after explaining exactly how we wanted it. Bread was hard and cold. Wine took forever to get to us. The manager did comp us the glasses of wine that took so long which was nice. I would say only go for the atmosphere and the drinks! Not the service or food"
1,"Person who delivered the pizza was amazing! Super sweet older man! Unfortunately, the order was wrong. I ordered extra chicken and there was no chicken at all. I called the store, person on the phone was ridiculously rude! Well we are slammed so what do you want me to do? Was his response and attitude! Wtf? It would be 45 mins to get the correct order so he credited me a large pizza for next time. I can careless for the free pizza. To be honest, it would have been nice to be treated with some damn respect. You got the order wrong not me! Also the track your order ? Isnt the pizza checked for quality before it leaves so why was the order wrong! Seriously! Get it together!"
1,"I went here a few different times. Fine dining? NOT! How would you like to be sitting down in a place where all they do is smoke while you eat? The waitress takes a half an hour just to come and greet you upon arrival (self-seating), not to add she doesn't even have a smile for you when she finally gets to your table. First time there I had some food and didn't feel good the next day, second time there I just drank juice/coffee cuz I was scared to eat there again. Third time I sat outside and had a glass of wine and waited an hour and a half to get my dang bill, then decided I better go in and ask for the check myself."
1,"Disaster. This place is a nightmare. It's relatively new and already doesn't look it. And, I had one of the worst checkout experiences of my life. I got in line and the line was long and getting longer. There were 2 cashiers one of them had a very large transaction so the front end supervisor hopped on. All of a sudden, one of the cashiers, who was dressed as Bon Qui Qui, stopped ringing and started processing her go-backs IN SLOW MOTION. She would periodically look up and notice the line getting progressively longer, but continued to move at the pace of molasses in winter. She has a promising future at the DMV. After nearly 10 minutes of this the front end supervisor told her that she wasn't supposed to start that until 2:45 (it was now 2:40 and she had been at this for 10 minutes) and that it shouldn't take her more than 5 minutes. Clearly she hasn't seen her in action. Or inaction. The girl acted like this was new information (I doubt it) and went ahead and started ringing. I swear there was steam coming off the entire line. It was totally ridiculous. I will absolutely never shop here again."
1,"It was obvious that unless you were a regular of the bartenders that the service from them would suck.  We sat at the bar to have some food and drinks and no more than five words were spoke to us by either bartender.  No hello, goodbye or thank you, just a\"" what can i get you.\"" If your just looking for a cold beer and decent food than the spot is good.  We ended up having a food server, Corey, help us at the bar and his service is the only reason this place gets any stars.  If you are a manager or owner reading this we were there on Mon 17th between 6 and 7 p.m.  I sure you can find out who the bartenders were and maybe think about some customer service training."
1,"Just had the rudest worker at the pharmacy. The car ahead of us in the drive thru line took 20+ minutes. When it was our turn the tech asked our name, said hold on, was gone several minutes then we saw her grab her keys and drinks and leave. Several minutes later another tech came to the window. When I asked what happened she snapped at me!! Like its my fault that their customer service sucks?!"
1,"The place was fun, the DJ was good...but the staff are jerks.  Someone stepped on my foot, and it started bleeding everywhere (a surprising amount of blood, considering it was my toe), and instead of being accommodating, they hassled us about leaving through the closest exit, since that was the front door.  They all just took turns looking at my bleeding foot with their flashlights.  Finally, after some convincing, they let me and boyfriend out the front, but made my other 2 friends walk through the entire club to get to the normal exit.  Lame!"
1,"This is one of those stores where you hate going but you have to. Walmart is a disgusting store expecially this one , this store is dirty, has a prostitute motel in front and also attracts the crazies. I cannot stand Walmart and will avoid it whenever I can. \n\nIf you need help with ANYTHING in the store I garuntee you can look up on your phone on how to build it or find it faster then the employees can think of whats going on. And the \""management team\"" is always never to be found . YAY for the biggest company in the world."
1,"two years ago i loved Fremont street experience, the casinos, the drinking and everything i was planning on staying in the golden nugget on my next visit..\n\ni am so glad i didn't. i this time i couldn't get a drink at any of the casinos i was gambling in. if i did order it took forever. \n\nthe worse part this time was the amount of bums, and dealers, and prostitutes wandering around. i know this is Vegas but it was bad. so bad we left after only 3 hours of being there. normally we drink and play for a solid 6 in old Vegas. \n\ni will be skipping this street next time i am in town."
1,Decided to check out Taps for the first with my girlfriend. Immediately upon walking in it was extremely uncomfortable. Everybody stared as we walked in and there was no hostess and no seat your self sign posted.  Couldn't even tell who was an employee or a customer. Eventually receiving no service we walked back out. We will not be back.
1,Full of overpriced shops that think they are on Fifth Ave in New York not a sleazy Las Vegas Blvd in a area built with losers money. This is just a Simon Property Mall like in bumfuck USA
1,"Although we liked Dr Patel I have to agree with the other reviews that the front and back office staff have much to be desired.\n\nWe overpaid the amount owed his office and even though his office acknowledges that they owe us the money in over three months we do not have it.\n\nWe have emailed the office manager every 7-10 days. She'll respond saying that she'll look into it and get back to us but never does. Very aggravating.\n\nThere are many great doctors out there to choose from. I don't know how you would know how the support staff is until you actually do business with the clinic. If you decide to go with AARH I hope you have a better experience than we did.\n\nBTW, this is not the first time that we experienced horrible communication with the staff there but this was the one that pushed me over the edge to let others know."
1,"This place was unbelievable poor in regards to service. \n\nI have yet to ever sit down in a busy restaurant for a lunch service, read the menu, choose a dish, feed my 9 month daughter, clean up and leave and not once have one staff member come by take our order."
1,"Terrible food, slow service with attitude. Don't waste time or money on this place. Ordered two appetizers, both disgusting. The smell and taste of old grease was awful. Ordered a coke and beer. The coke was just soda water. Told the waitress and she said, \"" I know, we are busy.\""  How about serve us water and say the coke needs to be changed. I guess they are use to serving SLOP."
1,"Just an FYI for those who might have purchased a Amazonlocal coupon for this dump...I ordered my food to take out and was about to pay the difference when the guy taking my order said they do not take the coupon. He was mumbling something about letting people know. OK, so now I paid $10 and i cannot get what I was promised, so he had some other guy who walked in, who apparently worked there, call the owner.  Well, same story...they will not accept the coupon. From what he said, Amazonlocal was not depositing whatever percentages they owed from the promotional sales. Luckily, I was able to get a refund from Amazonlocal.  Those who have purchased a voucher for this place, don't even bother to order, just get a refund! Also, they call themselves \""President's Pizza\"", as well....I have seen another Amazonlocal voucher for this place as well but never purchased it (Thank Goodness!)  Get your refund!!!! By the way, for all you die hards, perhaps the food is decent, which is why, to be fair i have not rated it, but most of the salad items are not even available....Hmmm...False advertising on both counts, here?!?"
1,"The waiter warned, \""The plate is hot.\"" True. But the food was not. And who has ever heard of a Mexican restaurant without complimentary chips and salsa? Not worth the trip."
1,"This store was a major disappointment. It's on a dirty part of the strip, was crowded, and was totally and completely uninteresting. Even my daughter was bored. I thought the store would have a more interesting design...or at the least would have interesting products. All they have is excessive (and tacky) merchandising, a few extra colors of M&M's and that's about it. They don't carry any of the interesting M&M flavors or limited editions. Skip it and spend more time in the Coca-cola store."
1,"I just want to say thank you for denying us service at 6pm when it was completely dead inside your restaurant and telling my guests and I everything was reserved.\nWe ended up at Roka Akor which seemed like a better environment anyways when we walked in, and the food was incredible.\n\nHere's the ironic part, we went to you first because you had the highest rating on Yelp. Sucks to shoot yourself in the foot, aye? If I could give zero stars for customer service, I would. Good luck :)"
1,"Terrible customer service, really bad for Peter Piper. \n\nOur food took forever to arrive, and yet it wasn't all ready to be served with only half the order available. This was despite the lengthy wait and our buzzer going off to alert that our order was ready. No sufficient explanation or apology was given when the issue was brought up. The staff does not go above and beyond, or really even meet the standard expectations.\n\nSo all you're left with now is game machines for your kids, except those don't entirely work. Some had tokens jammed to render them inoperable, others simply didn't operate correctly. \n\nVery unfortunate family experience that won't be repeated."
1,Terrible service no one would communicate. I sat there for an hour with my feet in the water waiting for a pedicure. No one came over to tell me if it would be 5 more minutes10 minutes 45 minutes I was really annoyed. They had one lady working on my sister's pedicure for half an hour before I gave up because no one was helping me. I just think if they would have communicated how long I would have had to wait it wouldn't have been as bad. \n\nAlso super slow even after we explained we were in a hurry ( i had already been sitting there for an hour now) they did not move any faster to finish my sister's feet and were unapologetic no one tried to make sure that we left satisfied at all its pretty much like they didn't care.\n\nI definitely do not recommend it unless you have 3 to 4 hours to spare for a manicure and or pedicure. And just for reference it was not busy.
1,Hours during the week are shorter than shown on website and Yelp. Pizza was tasteless and cold. Crust was hard as a rock. Won't be back. Totally disappointed at the waste of money!  If this is what people think authentic Italian food and pizza is like they are sadly mistaken!
1,Was not impressed at all. I ended up ordering the special Deezee and getting sick from it. Nice atmosphere but the food was horrible.
1,this casino sucks dont stay here worst customer service in the table games buffet also one of the worst anywhere
1,Bad service\n\nAfter 20 minutes trying to order 2 pizzas off of the Dominos' website. Every time I tried to make my order it would reset and make me start again. I called the manager of the store to tell him about the website. His reply to my complant was basiclly what ever. I have 3 hungry kids screeming for pizza and no sorry or comp. anything.\n\nThere are a lot of places to eat and pizza (fast food) shouldn't be this hard.
1,"Came to rc Willey to buy a mattress. I had one sales rep ask me if they could help me. I said yes I was looking for a low cost mattress, I just needed something for the holidays. He pointed me in the direction and left. I guess my purchase was so low he didn't want to stick around to help me purchase the mattress. I stood there by myself for 15 min waiting for someone to help me. I just left. Bad customer service."
1,Has this place changed hands? Workers can't speak English. Food quality has gone way down. Ordered the steak hoagie and took two bites and couldn't finish it. Is this Italian food or Eastern European food?\n\nOnly gratification was hearing manager swear at confused workers in foreign language. I used to love this place. Now? Nobody has a clue.
1,"We walked in and asked for a 30-minute foot massage. They didn't understand anything we said. We asked if there was a wait, they said \""ok\"". After a few minutes, we asked again, they said \""ok\"". After waiting at least 30 minutes, they told us it would be another 15 minute wait. I left. \nWe spoke to 3 different individuals.....not one of them understood anything we were saying. How do u operate a business like this? I've been to other foot reflexology places before. They were great. This one was not."
1,"After a two-week long debacle that ended without a satisfying resolution (see my initial review) I sent an email to Apple CEO Tim Cook.  That got a response from a person named Jason.  Like everyone at Apple, Jason was courteous and polite (which I appreciate).  And, like everyone at Apple, he was unable or unwilling to make an extraordinary gesture to compensate me for an extraordinarily bad experience.  After 30 minutes on the phone with him, I had the distinct impression that he had called me to convince me that they had done a very good job.  \n\nHere's some news for you: you didn't do a good job.  I told you you didn't do a good job.  And I told you exactly what I would consider to be an appropriate remedy for the incredibly bad job you did.\n\nPerhaps my favorite part of this conversation was when Jason told me-- and I am not making this up-- that Apple \""isn't concerned about profits.\""\n\nIs that a joke?  Everyone knows that Apple has higher profit margins than anyone else in the business.  Am I seriously supposed to believe that this somehow all happens by accident?  \n\nHint: don't assume that I am incredibly stupid just because I have spent years paying your ridiculous markups."
1,"This store is under heavy construction.  That being said, I walked in and thought I was in a bomb shelter that just took a bunker buster.  To be fair I didn't spend much time in there, but that's because I was scared that zombies would come lurching around the corner at any moment.  \n\nPerhaps I'll go back sometime when the construction is over, and I'm feeling super adventurous, I just hope I don't step on any forgotten land mines."
1,"Disgusting. Left all choices up to the chef. Bleach-flavored cucumber amuse bouche. Black been soup was gritty and hard. Foie gras sorbet was single worst tasting thing ever, even more than durian. Entr\u00e9e was an entire plate of fried sweetbreads. Complained and they replaced it with sand-filled escargot. Only barely edible dessert in group was bland creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. \n\nTerrible service from rude waiter who abandoned table after 15 minutes - without a replacement. \n\nJust visiting the Phoenix area and this single restaurant was such a negative experience that it has led to canceling reservations at other \""top rated\"" places during the trip."
1,First visit since they switched from Kachina to Desert Cadillac.  Also will be my last visit!!!  Very disappointed with bait and switch in the service department.  Went online to book appointment for an oil change.  They had a coupon for $39.99 (which I thought was kind of high) after I dropped of vehicle and was in the waiting room they came in and told me the oil change would be $100 plus and that they would Not accept the coupon from their website.  If you need your Cadillac serviced go somewhere else!!!
1,"I was so excited to get my hair cut & colored because of the great reviews on here. I wish I could be one of the very happy customers, but unfortunately, I am not. \n\nHair cut? It was okay. She seemed like she was in a hurry & for the price I should have gone somewhere else. \n\nColor? The dye that is actually on my hair looks nice, but the dye is also ALL OVER my face, my forehead, my neck... I can understand a bit on my forehead but why are there streaks of dye on my cheek? On my EYELID? When Felice (the owner) was dying my hair, the dye was flying everywhere. \n\nI give two stars, because the place was easy to find & Felice seemed like a nice lady. Also, they offer other services there &I a lot of products. But I will not be going back.\n\nEdited to one star, because I found a ton of dye IN my ear. & now I am pissed off. I could have done a better job then she did."
1,"We made reservations for this place and when we got there, our table wasn't ready. We had to wait 10mins for our table. Once we were seated, we waited for 30mins and nobody served us even after repeatedly asking for service!! We walked out. Also the place looked a little dirty."
1,"Pretty disappointed. I was excited to try this place out for a late dinner, after reading all the previous reviews; just wanted to go and place a to-go order. Arrived at 9:35pm, and they told us the kitchen was closed. Most restaurants have to serve until their closing time (which was 10pm). Maybe it's just Chinese places that stop serving? I'm not sure. But I'm not used to walking into a place BEFORE they close and being sent away. They lost my business for good. I know I should have called beforehand. I normally wouldn't go to a restaurant that close to closing time, but when I do, they at least take my money!"
1,We ordered this about a year ago shortly after they first opened. Overall the pizza was decent but seemed almost like an at home frozen throw it in the oven style and what really killed it was using CANNED MUSHROOMS! We will never go again due to our favorite topping coming out of a can...
1,"Wow this is  NOT the best in town nor are they \""same day service\"" as advertised!  Went to pick up my husbands shirts the next day and they still weren't ready.  They said they would deliver them to our hotel later that day but nope they did not do that either!  And when we went to pick them up   His shirts were missing! Won't use these guys again, ever"
1,"Not a fan! food was overpriced and mediocre at best! IMO go to HOLSTEIN's if you want a good burger! this was eeeehhh , even if they give you a free mac n cheese fried balls for checking in, still wouldnt go back!"
1,"I asked for a drink with no ice, they brought me a cup filled with ice. I asked for another drink and reminded her I wanted no ice, so she brings me a cup of ice. I told her again I wanted no ice, so her manager comes out and says, \""What does he want\"" so I said I keep asking for a drink with no ice. He brings me a drink - with all ice! They also kept bringing me a medium when I asked for a large. I said I'd even keep paying for a new drink. They don't listen, and they don't care about customer service at all. This place is horrible."
1,"Yes, they're quick - but they overcharge you and have no concept of \""customer service\"". They pulled the old bait and switch the price on me when I tried to redeem a coupon but only AFTER they'd already done the test. I won't be back and recommend you go somewhere else!!"
1,"Fail fail fail!!! Thought about trying this place before leaving Vegas and it was a fail.. Everything is not good. The only thing good is the Mac n cheese bar, how do u mess up in that. Try ceasars if u wanna eat a buffet"
1,"I hate to be harsh especially because the service was good. The food was disgusting. First of all the menu is about 40 pages long (maybe longer), how can a restaurant make 40 pages of food well?  It's not possible. The Pad Thai was basically noodles soaked in tomato paste. It was hands down the worst Pad Thai I have ever had in my life, it was almost unbelievable. Some things were okay...the spring rolls and soup. That being said Pad Thai is a staple in a Thai restaurant and should never be that bad."
1,"I can't really say anything bad about the restaurant experience, other than to note the menu is very, very limited, if you don't want a burger ... But then again, the name of the restaurant is Meatheads ... Also a very sterile environment, and very loud, with lots of hard surfaces reflecting every sound.\n\nMore significantly, the burger was a major disappointment! The best description would be GREAT selection of toppings on an extremely ordinary and virtually tasteless hamburger patty, and a Wonderbread bun. I mean, the bun was really disappointing ... \n\nMy girlfriend and I each had a burger - no fries and no drinks - and it came to $12. With fries and drinks it would have been $20.  Seriously, I would have been more satisfied with a McDonalds or Burger King hamburger - maybe not so fancy but half the price ...\n\nHonestly, I would never go out of my way to return to this restaurant, and anybody who recommends the burgers at this restaurant as anything more than mediocre has really questionable taste in food ... IMHO."
1,"Okay, I'm absolutely, positively, well and truly DONE with this place. Last night (Wednesday) we had arranged with friends to meet there for dinner at 6:45pm. When we got there (6:45pm) there was a CLOSED sign in the window -- AGAIN! I've mentioned the ridiculous business hours before - such as taking Sunday off to celebrate the fact that it comes after Saturday etc. It seems that they have all new business hours, and what I read has permanently lost them four customers.\n\nClosed Monday and Tuesday (?!) Wednesday open 11am-3pm (!?) Thursday open 11am-8pm. That's basically as far as I bothered to read.\n\nThis restaurant can go to hell - that's the third time I've arrived at a completely appropriate time of the evening only to have the place inexplicably closed.  I don't care about the recent renovations and frankly there are way too many other delicious places around to be bothered severely adjusting schedules and timing to get into this place during the three or four hours a week that they could be BOTHERED to open. Screw them.\n\nEDIT 20120925: Apparently they've changed the name of this place to \""Eddie's European Bistro\"". A lot of time has passed since I got the sh1ts with them; I MAY decide to return and see if anything's improved. If they're closed once more that'll be IT though."
1,Obviously I am Vietnamese but for some reason LYNN my pedicurist couldn't pick that up and continues to beg her co-workers in Vietnamese to up sell me to a gel mani-pedi. Then continues to bribe someone to even do my manicure while she does my toes so she can get home and sleep. Super unprofessional establishment. My top coat is only painted down the middle of my nails and my pedicure was really half done. Didn't take care of my toes that I asked about. It's one thing to talk your language but it's another to not even do your job.
1,"For my friend's bachelorette party, a group of 8 of us went here. We were all dressed up nice and none of us had gotten rowdy drunk yet. The bouncer was polite enough but straight up told me he wouldnt let us in because we were women. I asked him if we all stood with a man in line and came in with a man could we get in? He told me no. What a disappointment! Obviously won't recommend this place."
1,Not a fan of this place. I hear its fun on weeknights. But don't bother coming on the weekend. Especially for a birthday. They'll have you wait two or more hours for a table even though the promise you an hour to hour and a half. They'll say you're next on the list but continually seat people before you. Lame. Gotta love being lied to and having your friend's birthday party being basically ruined.
1,"Recently moved to this area and have been looking for a good sports bar and outdoor patio type restaurant. Met a few friends there, they arrived before me and already had drinks. Took almost 30 minutes before the server came to the table to get my drink order. We also ordered our food at that time just in case she never came back.  We ordered and then a table next to us ordered a few minutes later. We waited for some Jalapeno Poppers. The table next to us was served poppers and then about 15 minutes later (NOT our waitress) came up and told us that they were out and sold them all. They left them on the Bill as well. The food was ok but not great. The service was horrid. We literally had to get up and find our waitress to fix the bill. I probably could have got up and walked out and she never would have noticed. I have not nor ever will do that. But I think that being it wasn't busy enough for that kind of service. I will not be going back to this restaurant. Was there 3 hours and saw the waitress maybe 3 times."
1,"My wife and I went to this restaurant, hoping to have a nice Italian meal, or a pizza.  We walked in the front door, and stood right next to the sign that said, \""Please wait to be seated\"".  OK. We waited.  Several employees passed us, back and forth, several times - no smiles, no acknowledgment, nothing. Finally, after 5 minutes a young lady, asks us \""Did you want to be seated?\""\n\nReally.  \""Did you want to be seated?\""!!!!\n\n\""Sure, thank you.\""  (although, my wife wanted to say...\n\""No, we just wanted to stand here and look at your fine establishment.\"")\n\nShe walked us to a table, dropped two menus on top, and walked away.  \n\nReally!  I don't think so.  \nThank you very much, we'll go eat someplace else.  Never going back to Rosati's.  Stay away."
1,"The resort was pretty nice, but not fantastic. We were happy for the price we paid. We had a good time at the pool and a nice breakfast. \n\nThen Friday night, disaster struck. The fire sprinkler went off in the dining area of our unit. Luckily for the resort I am a light sleeper and heard it \n(it wasn't loud) or they may not have found out until the entire unit was flooded and leaking downstairs. So I woke up and called for help. \nThe response was reasonably prompt and complete disaster was averted, but I did spend half the night cleaning up water from our belongings, \nthe furniture and the floor.\n\nI don't think I was unreasonable to ask for some consideration for our inconvenience. Upon checkout the next morning I talked to the front \ndesk manager who said he would look into getting our room reimbursed. It has been several weeks now and I have called back three or four times, \nbut the manager will not return my calls."
1,"Bottom line: I won't consider going here again. \nI was looking for a comfortable tapas place in PGH. Sadly, yelp reviews from all venues are horribly mixed. So we chose this one simply because of its location. The food was pretty good, I have to say. But the service was unbelievably bad. The guys were nice enough, but I felt I was being waited on by the cast of \""Half Baked\"". If they were stoned out of their minds but managed at least occasional service, I would have been content. The first dude took our order for wine and hot tapas and 1/2 hour later I saw him walking into the building with groceries. We still hadn't anything to eat or drink. Finally the guy at the bar came over to tell us they were out of the wine we ordered. In fact, they were out of ALL wines. I'm not even sure how this is possible. Then he wanted to know if we would like anything to eat... The place was maybe 50% capacity, but given the confusion and pace of the service, you would think the doors were bursting with demanding diners. \n\nIt's hard to be too nasty about this because the servers were relatively nice (who can be rude when you're smoking jammers instead of serving customers?). But jesus, I don't need to pay for this kind of thing!\n\nI'll try another and hope it's a step up..."
1,"This place is ginormous, and dingy if you ask me. We asked if we could get an upgrade due to it being our honeymoon, and we wanted to pay for it.. so they gave us a discount- great.. um really... a suite?! it had old bed linens, an old bed and an old tv with a swivel to have it be in the bedroom or \""living room\"". The room reeked of smoke and we called and complained.. after realizing this is only for one night, we sucked it up. \n\nnot only were the places to eat, horrible. but the hotel itself was a hassle. The lion exhibit was actually cool, but the people who run the gift store had a serious attitude, if you dont like your job, quite and don't be in \""sales\"". We left and went out other than staying in that hotel, it was totally not worth the money at all. The charged us the wrong rate and we had to wait to get the refund. Then when they send me a survey after we stayed, we filled it out and within a couple weeks got something in the mail saying we can have a free stay when we come back. I think not.\n\nThey could comp my entire stay and I couldnt bother. Next time Im gonna try the mgm grand in my home state of CT I bet its more updated and nicer."
1,"Read reviews elsewhere to get the real picture.  This place is getting really, really bad.  Corporate management needs to change out the office staff and enforce posted policies before this whole complex goes to ruin.  It's so sad to see such a pretty location be handled so poorly.  It could be (and used to be) a great complex.  Now it's not worth the high rent they charge, the crime you'll be exposed to, and the noisy neighbors."
1,"Stay away! This place is horrible. Some of the worst service I have ever received. Unfortunately, this is the only place for us to get warranty work done. As soon as we can get everthing fixed, we will never be back.\n\n\nIf you still choose to do business with these folks, don't say you weren't warned. You will be sorry."
1,"Way below average.  They forgot half my order. The wings were small and not meaty. The sauces were not tasty.  We couldn't even tell which sauce was which after tasting them. The prices were decent for wings, but not these wings. Don't think people who gave this restaurant a good review have ever had a wing before.  Best part of the meal was the coleslaw. Maybe that's what they should rename the restaurant."
1,"Negative stars again I say!!! I've been contacted by what I'm sure is one of their employees trying to bully and harass me into changing my review.  I stand by it, it goes unchanged Cox!\n\nWhich I'm more then positive the corporation would appreciate their employees reading through reviews to harass customers.  Keep a leash on your people."
1,"RUSHED OUT THE DOOR:  My wife and I invited some friends to this restaurant.  At first appearance, the service appeared to be genuinely good, but then it showed its true colors.  The Mustard Barbecue Beef Ribs were so burnt that when we called back the waiter, he recognized this before we even said anything and took it back.  We were brought the check without requesting it and without being offered dessert. As soon as we finished dessert, our water glasses and napkins were removed.  When I asked--tongue in cheek--if it was because he wanted us to leave, he said \""yes\"" just loud enough for us to hear.  Feeling lead out the door, my wife and I were quite embarrassed and will not be returning."
1,"I used to come here every single day for lunch religiously, but since new owners as of about 2 months ago or so it sucks big time.  They are changing everything including the recpies :( They will run this place into the ground and that really is too bad.\nI gave them a try a couple of times but its just not the same!!! Food and Service not happy with at all."
1,"Same problem as the earlier reviewer, but with even worse results.\n\nThe doctor (Dr. Bronstein) and PTs were great. Billing was a nightmare and you should consider this before becoming a patient.\n\nI received one statement after my insurance paid its portion. It showed a balance that did not make sense, so I called and left a message requesting more information. Instead of replying, they turned the roughly $30 bill over to a collection agency a few days later. Yes, that's right. One statement showing a current amount was turned over for collection.\n\nI requested information via the collection agency, since I had records of payments made for the items turned over for collection, and the Hand Center billing office refused to provide back up material. Since the collection agency said they would report this to the credit bureaus (despite it appearing to be a bogus claim for which no documentation was provided) I ended up paying.\n\nI see there is also a complaint filed with the Better Business Bureau for billing problems with the Hand Center. Maybe this is common.\n\nLike the other reviewer, the medical care was first rate, but you should probably avoid Bronstein Hand Center."
1,"WOW, I have never had such horrible customer service in my life. The associate was completely inept, he could not comprehend the most basic concepts and I was forced to repeat myself numerous times. I asked him for an address and contact information for a service center because the car I rented needed an oil change right after I received it; and he told me he didn't know the address and said \""he service center down this road somewhere you will find it\"" a disgruntled look is all I could muster up for him. Anyway I will never go back to them again and wouldn't even bother calling unless you want to be on the phone listening to drivel and unanswered questions for hours"
1,"I'll update my rating once they fix the horrendous bee problem they have!!! We couldn't even enjoy ourselves without worrying about getting stung everywhere we went. Bees at the train station, during the ride, at the playground, and especially around the trash cans. It was miserable. Such a shame because it is a beautiful park and the playground is one of the best in AZ."
1,Worst hotel in Vegas!  Thry don't stand behind the quoted prices and unreasonable front desk - they love to argue. Will never ever stay here again!!  With so many hotels in the area you would think they would value the business of frequent guests but I was wrong on that one.
1,Waited 15 min before order was taken. The employee was nice but she can't do it all!!!\nGet her some help.\nI went across the street to Jamba Juice. The  service will cost this company.
1,"Came here for brunch for my birthday weekend and it was a total fail. Its rare to say that yelp has totally disappointed me on this one.\n\n I got the steak and frites bordelaise. The frites were good but I got tired of it so quick because it was too salty. The steak was not even that great. It had way too much sweet flavor going on on such a thin sliced steak.\nMy friends got the broccoli and cheese crepe and it was gross.\n Another friend got the tuna melt sandwich, the presentation of this dish was nice but it was also gross.. All I could taste was the olive and I hate olives. \nMy other friend got the quiche and it was nothing special. \nThe only good dish was the prime steak sandwich with au jus sauce but I have had better in oc.\n\nThe service was eh. Our server was slow and rarely checked up on us.  This restaurant is overhyped."
1,Food sucks. Chips stale. Shrimp taco unetable. Frys were good. If you want to eat don't come here. They have a bar and tons of tvs with sports on them if u only want to drink and watch a game
1,"So I came across this place via Groupon.  I check reviews before I purchase on groupon and it had a decent rating and some great suggestions.  Upon arrival, I noticed a sign in the front that said Attn: Groupon users, Groupon not eligible on Happy Hour Rolls/Specialty Rolls.  I ordered a 3 rolls which I only received 1 roll, hamachi Kama, and the udon tempura. The female manager came up and apologized for the wait in the rolls and than apologized that I never received the 2 other rolls.  The sushi chefs seemed to be drinking sake bomb after sake bomb and slacking on the rolling!  \n\nAlso, their marketing gimmick is 50% rolls (Normal avg. price $15) then they give rolls for $7.50 but do give small portions.  \n\nThe food that did come was ok at best.  Staff definitely needs to improve on their customer service and get those rolls on the table.  \n \nBTW, this is a Korean owned Japanese restaurant."
1,"Creative concept - everything is made of ice, even the glasses! \n\nBut the $17 admission fee is unnecessary and the Skyy Vodka drinks are overpriced. If robbing you of $17 wasn't enough Minus 5 is equipped with their own cameramen since patrons are not allowed to bring in cellphones or cameras and are forced to buy photo packages if they want to have any tangible memory of their Minus 5 experience.    \n\nBar is super small and empty - maybe everyone else was smart enough to stay away!"
1,"DEAR D'acks Oganization,\n\nVery frustrated with our families' experience happening RIGHT NOW at the Chase Field.  \n\nSitting in 206 with food service at the seats only to have yet to see our server (it is top of the 4th inning right now with about 13,000 in attendance).  So at the bottom of the 1st inning we ventured out to get food for the family.  After waiting in line for about 25 minutes we ordered about found out that about 1/3 of our order was not available - THEY WERE OUT IN THE 2nd INNING.  So we ordered what we could and waited another 30 minutes for the food to make its way out.  It did and then we found out they were out of condiments (keep in mind, this was in the club level).  \n\nIn sum, by the time we got back to our seats, our food was cold and we are very unhappy.  This last weekend was supposed to be for fan appreciation and I don't feel very appreciated right now.  \n\nWe love our Diamondbacks but I can't help but feel incredibly disappointed right now.  Our family has been season ticket holders and if this is what is to be expected as a fan experience,  you can count us out."
1,"We went to this place to try out their happy hour and the small plate menu. I had been there the weekend before with a friend and had ordered simple food. Now I thought we would try something a little more ambitious. The simple order was a california roll and the Korean pork tacos. The tacos were a bit greasy, but that was expected. \n\nOn this second trip, we ordered a shrimp tempura roll and chicken yakisoba. It was a weekend evening and the place was empty but it was late for dinner. The shrimp tempura roll was rubbery and the yakisoba had over cooked noodles, bad tasting chicken and a gloppy sauce that came right out of a jar. We called over the server and asked and he just said thats how they make it. \n\nThe soy sauce, their own recipe, tasted rancid. We spoke to the manager and he just acted like I should be honored to eat at Pearl Sushi and they were in Chandler doing us a favor. \n\nWe eat out a lot and we won't be returning to this place."
1,"Terrible, i mean TERRIBLE service.  this place is an absolute joke.  food is almost as bad as the service.  $4 for a tiny taco and no sides.  insane.  this place will be out of biz very soon."
1,"First off, This place BLOWS. Second off, this place Really Blows. Have you ever heard of an $11 well mojito -- yeah, me neither. And since they don't list drink prices you don't know until you get the bill. Kids pizza -- $10. By the way, it is a Totinos Frozen pizza that cost them about $1 whole sale. Bottom line, 1 app, 1 pasta dish, 1 kids meal, 2 mojitos -- $80+ post tip. Went to the Bellagio the next night and spent less on 2 adults to their buffet -- which had sushi, King Crab Legs, and Kobe beef among all the traditional staples of a Vegas buffet. The kid got to eat free. Avoid Rain Forest cafe at all cost. You can take the family to much cooler venues in Vegas -- most of which is free."
1,"The employees at this location are RUDE! They are so miserable. They don't even call out your name when your drink is ready. I tried to use my free birthday drink coupon and the girl got bitchy and was like \""we aren't a real Starbucks so we don't take those.\"" Well clearly... I would be disturbed if you were a \""real\"" Starbucks.\nPass this fake-ass place and go to a \""real\"" Sbux."
1,Was at this place two years ago and it was one of  my favorite . However on this day we had been waiting for the order when off the side I noticed a big ass cockroach on the wall. No big deal it wasn't in my food . Week later I ordered to go and just as I was finishing off my rice I saw one big antenna from one bis ass ..... Yes cockroach.... I am sorry to say I still have a hard time with rice. But not from this place. It is much too bad because I loved this place. I hope that the owners have rectified this......
1,"If I could give no stars I would. Word to the wise, do not eat here, especially their tempting sign for AYCE. It was so gross I practically, actually threw up the food. Their sushi is not fresh and since we sat near the kitchen, we learned that their sushi has been sitting out all day waiting for ayce customers."
1,"Very disappointed! We were in the area and decided to go to Joe's and try it out for the first time (usually we go to Ritas). We parked, walked inside, cute decor nice options on the menu but there was a line. No big deal, we stood in line and figured it would move along...no...hardly. I don't know if it was the cashier(s) or the customers but after waiting 15 minutes in line and only moved a couple steps we decided the wait wasn't worth it. We weren't the only people to decide we weren't going to wait, 2 other couples ended up walking away before us and then shortly after we left. It was obvious there was a line, it was obvious people were leaving because the wait was too long, and not once none of the employees said anything, didn't step up to help with the line, nothing!! Joes could have yummy Italian ice, but I wouldn't know since I couldn't order, not in 15 minutes anyways. Who knows when I'll try it or if I even will."
1,"Celebrating Birthday with Spouse on Friday night. No parking available at entrance to check in. Check in staff was So-So. Received room info, walked back to car, drove over to room, got bags out, walked up to room, opened door and Uh-Oh, this room has double beds, not the King we made reservation for. Call front desk, got the \""fully booked\"" comment then put on hold. Told to come back to front. Get bags, Load up car, drive back to front where there's no parking. Stand in line, go through whole process again, get new room assigned. Walk back to car. Drive over to other side of property. Unload bags. Walk to new room and open doors to interior design circa 1981. Give up. Drop off bags. Walk over to restraurant and literally cannot figure out where the door is to go in. Walk back to car. Drive over to Elephant bar. Have some good food and a some drinks. Go back to room. Sleep for night. Check out and go home to review my $175 hotel bill and wonder what I paid for."
1,"I went in to pump gas and get my car washed,  I asked for military discount and they only have military discount on Mondays, cause the military only serves on Mondays   smh"
1,Overpriced!! The juices and the hardware. Juices were nothing to rave about. I tried a ton of them & none of them stood out as an ADV. \nThe one star that I did give them was for the cleanliness & the decor.
1,I occasionally been here in this location. I had bad service all the time. The servers are always in a mad mood and always rude. I really dislike the service at this location. Don't recommend this location.
1,"2 out of 3 times i have called in an order to be picked up, the sand which was not only ready after 15minutes but not even entered into their system. Getting old"
1,"Dam shame, everyone feels like they have to price gouge you at the airport. $7 for a draft beer! Ridiculous."
1,I have given this place 2 tries and they are just terrible. The sauce here taste funny and the overall pizza was not good. The worst thing about this place is the wait times. The last time I order over the phone app and it said my pizza was ready for pickup at 6:10pm. I got there right on time and watched them hand my order to the person in front of me. They then had to remake my order which made me wait there for 20 minutes.
1,"id give this place no stars if i could,  the food was downright awful, the sides they give you to go along with the meats like the cream spinach, plantains, and carrots were basically not edible, we started to joke about how bad the meal was not one person in our party thought it was any good.   the meats were mostly over cooked and very bland, the one thing i enjoyed was the pineapple not the pork that came with it just the pineapple. and the flank steak when not overcooked was actually OK as for the rest just terrible i will never go to this restaurant again and would never recommend it to anyone"
1,"Don't frequent this business unless you want to be treated very badly. I was subjected to the rudest, most passive aggresive behavior I have ever experienced. Alison made it clear that my job was too small for them to be bothered with, and I understood, but she was disrespectful about it. Fine. I left. Then an installer called to tell me she was sending him to my house. So I went in to choose tile, and Alison was impatient and angry. The installer came. Then I went back  to the store for a third time to buy the tile , only to be told \""I should shop at Lowes\"". Why would a business drive customers away and then pull them back and then insult them and refuse to do business?  I told Alison she had a terrible attitude, and she said \""I know\"".  Something is very wrong with this place!  The employees here should stand on their feet at Lowes for a day and learn to be polite to customers....shame on them!"
1,"Gross!  Was so excited to try the Mexican hot dog and it was extremely disappointing.  I thought the bacon would add a lot of delicious flavor to the hot dog but it didn't.  The dog was tasteless as was the bacon.  Not sure how that happened.  the sweet bread bun was also very odd tasting with the hot dog.  Ive never had a mexican dog before so Im not sure if thats normal for the bun to be sweet but it really didn't work for me.  The whole thing left a horrible, awful taste in my mouth."
1,"It is with broken heart that I review Armstrongs poorly. I at one point would have gone through hell and high water to eat here. I went a few weeks back and it was terrible. The dining room was much dirtier than I remember. Our server didn't even take the time to talk with us and walked away before we finished ordering and never checked on us after the runner brought our food. She did however attempt to upsell our check with desert twice. To make it worse I voiced my concern to the manager, he replied with \""everyone has bad experienced sometimes but if you want to hate us for the rest of your life that is your choice\"". Not sure what prompted that response but I will say after walking out that night.... I will not be back."
1,This place serves mediocre food at best at an expensive price.  Refried beans are watery looks like they basically too a can of pinto beans and poured them on the plate. Chips and salsa costs an additional $5 even with a meal.  Not sure how they are managing to stay open.  Waitresses look like they came from Hooters.  There are better places for Mexican and lots of better places to eat and drink at Town Square!  Skip this one!
1,"Ordered the new Double Layered Premium Pepperoni Pizza.  Picked it up and they were out of the premium pepperoni.  The manager didnt even tell me. They didnt say a word till I went back in, because all I had was a pepperoni pizza.  No sorry or warning or anything.  Pizza was really bad as well.  This place has been going down hill for at least a year.  I finally learned my lesson."
1,"Haven't been able to get in contact with either of the owners, i graduated almost 2 weeks ago and they owe me money from a scholarship and state board.  i feel like they are giving me the run around! I was not on financial aid and i payed monthly. on time every time and now they can't get me my money how is that fair?????"
1,Well I got fifty bucks worth of veggies....i feel totally ripped off.  I came across an old menu and thought why not well don't make my mistake ....they must be really hurting or super cheap...and I'm not talking about the prices im talking about my meat and seafood entrees that came with about four pieces of meat the rest veggies but hey we all said the rice was great what a joke
1,"After driving by everyday for months I finally stopped in for a sub and was completely unimpressed. Even though the shop was nearly empty, the staff was indifferent and they forgot what I ordered multiple times.\n\nThe chicken parm sub I ordered was a hot bland mess. Instead of crispy breaded chicken inside, it had plain unseasoned chicken slices which was covered in cheese and a sauce one step away from ketchup. To top it all off the sub was microwaved, which made the inside insanely hot and turned to bread to rubber.\n\nMaybe their regulars subs are better, but the next time I spend $10 on a sub and soda, it definitely won't be here."
1,"I ordered two double cheeseburgers. When I got home, I found that the burger had no cheese, nor onions, ketchup, or pickles. Confused, I looked back at the receipt and it said two double cheeseburgers with no specifications and they charged me full price! Never going here again."
1,"Awful customer customer.  \n\nWe scheduled an appointment for today for quote on a new AC unit.  They called me 2 times to confirm the appointment.  Today I receive a call saying they're not coming.  If a customer is treated like this by sales when trying to buy a $6000 air conditioner, I can only imagine how bad it would have been with their service calls."
1,They only serve poor tasting fried food and the service is so bad. The bartender was rude and ignored me. I simply needed food to go but he was too busy talking to his buddy and reading the paper.
1,"shopped here for years , absolutely rubbish , only go here as no other close by. I live 2 minutes away. Atmosphere terrible , shop staff look really miserable , and depressed. Shelves always empty , always an excuse about short staffed . Would benefit from a local competitor , like a Morrison's or sainsbury in musselburgh."
1,"Dude, don't eat at Filiberto's.  I do not understand why they are so popular all over the Valley.  Maybe it's good for drunks whose stomachs are so polluted with skunky beer and whose palate has been ruined by smoking cheapass ditchweed, but the food at Filiberto's looks like someone already ate it and they put it on a paper plate.  I tried it twice to be fair and I feel lucky to be alive."
1,Never again...I guess they don't have much in the way of Mongolian bbq in Madison but this was a poor excuse for it at best...the meat didn't look fresh...the bar area was not well maintained...food was everywhere...the sauce area was a disaster...the offer you rice and soup to go with your dinner and the rice isn't cooked properly...and the soup was a sad excuse for hot and sour...YUCK!!!\nOnce and only once...never again HuHot
1,"Absolute worst. Disgusting rooms, rude staff(when you can find them), run down facilities. Bait and switch policies on hotel room rates and entertainment.Questionable security practices: I had to move rooms due to the billowing weed smoke from the room next door, coming under my door, and the manager gave me her UNIVERSAL key to use while the staff tried to fix their key machine.  Focus of the staff is where the money is: their casino, and they are uninterested in helping hotel guests.  Worst stay in a hotel i have ever experienced. Will never stay here again. There are plenty of other options available. NEVER stay here."
1,Burrito with chorizo had far too much chorizo. I requested light chorizo yet it was so overloaded I couldn't see or taste the egg. Wondering why they say they will make it with light chorizo and yet they never do. I'd prefer you mention up front if there is no possibility in decreasing the amount used..... This prevents setting one up for disappointment.
1,"We read all the reviews, were in the area so we thought we'd try it. We started with the breaded panko mozzarella. It was very thick so that the cheese did not completely melt. Pretty bland with little flavor. The marinara was good though. I ordered the sliders since I read so many good reviews on them and my husband ordered the lasagna. Our salad was all lettuce and four little diced tomatoes in the corners. The dressing was flavorful but I would have liked some Parmesan or something. Our meals came and the lasagna was lukewarm. We sent it back to the kitchen and it came back a few minutes later... Same piece of lasagna. They must have microwaved it which is completely tacky. Sauce was bland and it was mostly cheese. My sliders were also disappointing. All I could taste was the burned charcoal flavor of the inside of the bread.  The server was wonderful however. She was super attentive, apologetic about the lukewarm meal, and quick to refill our drinks. Of course, there were only 2 other parties in the restaurant. Overall, food was bland and lukewarm, and my husband's rating is Blech."
1,"No bathroom in the room, there is a \""bath area\"" - if you like to watch friends go number 2, then this is the place for you. If you're an \""alternative\"" couple from Boston or San Francisco then you'll love it.  Otherwise, it's a scam, go and complain and you have to pay to upgrade to a room with an actual bathroom. 1/2 mile walk to your room from the elevator.  Lobby is like being in a rap video, horrible.  Staff is very well trained to pretend shocked when people complain about no bathroom in the room.  I have a SAG card, but compared to them, I'm a rank amateur actor.  Go somewhere else."
1,Too expensive for what it is.  I had the ham and cheese flat this morning and it was the worst breakfast sandwich I have ever had in my whole entire life!!!  The ham was just awful and there was way too much cheese. I will certainly never go back for a breakfast sandwich.
1,"Front Customer Service Cashier was rude. I was staying there at the Monte Carlo and just checked out and acted like I found the buffet coupon on the floor.\nFood was pretty lousy. Bland and not well made in my opinion. Nothing I would ever consider coming back for.\nStay away and try things off the strip. Stay clear of The Buffet unless its free, but even though they say free you have to pay tax on free. All the low marks on yelp are accurate. Not a good hotel to stay, just stay clear the customer service sucks."
1,Worst airline ever.  Hidden charges galore.   Plane smells like vomit (someone obviously threw up in the airplane recently).  Excessive baggage charges. No courtesy beverage service. Gate service personnel rude.  I wish I could give 0 stars.
1,Today is the last time I will ever order steak and eggs at the 5 & Diner.  This is the third time in a row where the steak just sucked.  Not even eatable.  The server (Carlos) is nice and does what he can but it's not enough.  Carlos told me he tells his boss but nothing changes.  Well now I'm telling whoever runs that place that your breakfast steak is not worth serving let along to pay $12 for it.  Unfortunately you will never have a chance to get me back even if you solve the problem.
1,"The buffet was horrible for the price. Pay tge exta $10 and go to the Belagio or similar hotel.  Food was salty, low quality, and server s weren't very nice. Seating area is very uncomfortable.  Last thing I left gratuity but you get your own drinks.  If your looking for a quick bite to eat then this is the place for you.  There was no line.  Now I see why."
1,"I wanted to order a cake for my son first birthday. I went to the store, as I like the cake designs on their website.\n\nI didn't ordered right away but got four cupcakes to go: chocolate, vanilla , lemon and  red velvet .The lady told me those were basically same as the(some of the) cake flavors. I am sad to say they were: dry, very dry, so dry and super dry :(  And I went in the morning! After that I decided not to order from them.\n\nMaybe it was a fluke but that's not good when you're trying to sell cakes:-s\n\nMy rating is based on the cakes/cupcakes."
1,"Back in September ,2 stove burners went out. The warranty goes through Protech. Been dealing with these amateurs since then. The biggest problem with this company is Debbie. Don't know who she is to Protech, but she is the rudest, most belligerent, unprofessional individual I have ever dealt with. \n\nSince day one, I had issues with her. We went round and round with trying to fit a scheduled visit to the house for the stove. We came to an agreement. The day before the appointment, Debbie called and canceled, saying the tech isn't available. We then went around and around AGAIN to figure out a new appointment time. Debbie suggested I take a day off of work to accommodate the tech. I told her absolutely not, that the two days off in the middle of the week (not Saturday or Sunday ) were sufficient. Oh no, those days don't work for the tech, it will have to fall on a day of which I work, requiring me to miss work. We finally agreed on a time. The tech came out and looked at the stove. Told me the parts will take 7-10 business days. Fast forward to today. I once again called Debbie to get an update. She says I'm being impatient and unreasonable. That it's only been 9 business days since the tech visited. She tells me to give it more time. What a rude person."
1,There is a reason why the pie is cheap. Ate here twice and got sick both times. Spend the extra dough and go down the street or your toilet bowl will become your 2 day seat..... Woof
1,"NASTY!!!  That's all I am going to say.  I should have listened and never go to a place that as \""wok\"" in their name.\n\nWorst food I have ever had."
1,"I really enjoyed the food and ambiance of the restaurant and initially thought the waiter was great and very helpful. My problem with the restaurant came five days later when I was reconciling my credit card statement. For the meal I charged my credit card, and left a very generous cash tip of 25%. On the credit card statement I left zero on the tip line, and the total of the meal was entered in the total line. When the charge came through on my credit card, mysteriously the bill had gone up $10. I immediately informed the manager of the error which he was able to resolve; however he stated that the way I wrote a dollar sign and zero may have been confusing. My problem with this is that the total was clearly written and with the cash tip the waiter \""mistakenly\"" thought his service was worth a 42% tip?!?! Are you kidding me?! A word of advice, either pay cash or save your receipt!"
1,"I have gone back to them over the years because they do a good job with hemming. However, they are so rude!!!! The entire family is rude there.They act like you are putting them out and they are doing you a favor. I am engaged and just brought in a party dress for them to hem recently. Floor length gown. The woman told me the dress was meant for a younger girl. I think this stems from the fact they are very conservative. I guess she didn't like the fact that it was a little revealing on the top, but still very appropriate. At any rate, I am not certain, but wow super rude!!!! You don't say that to your customers even if you think that way. I was shocked. My friend went in there to have her designer jeans hemmed and they were really rude to her too. They also do not take credit cards. I will not be back ever.....Rude! Rude! Rude!"
1,"Wow, what a huge disappointment.  We had been looking forward to ending our trip with dinner at Craft after eating at some other fabulous places in Vegas.  Let's start with the positives:\nAmbiance - very nice\nWait Staff - Friendly and Knowledgeable\nOverall Menu - Good selections and great wine list\nPortion size - all very large - when they tell you they are sharable, they mean it!\n\nThen it all falls apart.\nNothing, and I do mean nothing that we ordered was not in need of seasoning.  Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables.\n\nAnd I am sure it is some new trend with chefs but really, a Caesar Salad that I had to spend 10 minutes cutting up....really I don't want to work that hard for a salad and yet again needed seasoning.\n\nProbably the most disappointing were the Filets which we both ordered medium rare.  No seasoning and we were expecting the filet to melt in your mouth.  These were not even close, \n\nAnd finally, a screaming baby throughout our whole dinner!\n\nAfter the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.  $400 for a dinner that on a scale of 1-10 we felt we could generously give a 3."
1,This is the worst hotel on the Las Vegas Strip i have ever stayed at! The food at the buffet is just as bad. The rooms are cheaper then some of the others on the strip but they are terrible. My sister told me who cares is not like were going to stay in the room anyway were in Las Vegas and most people are out all night but at some point you do have to come back to get some sleep. Never Again!
1,"Annoying to have 50 hands in your face,\nwhen trying to make your way up the strip.\n\nDisgusting to have 1000's of cards,\nlittering the entire sidewalk of the strip,\nwhen trying to make your way back down it."
1,"This place is NASTY.  The rooms are disgusting,  My husband and I stayed here unbeknownst to the conditions... we were stuck here for a few days.  Yeah.... you won't want to sleep here... or unpack your bags  I wouldn't let my dog sleep here.  The bed was awful.  The sheets smelled like sex and cigarettes (non-smoking room).  My husband and I each rolled to the center of the king-sized bed from it being so worn.  \r\n\r\nThey might as well rent out the rooms for 20 minute intervals.  Obviously all of the hotel's money goes to the casino and main floor remodeling.\r\n\r\nIf I could give it zero stars, I would.."
1,"Dark\nFront desk staff very unfriendly, which is unusual for Pittsburgh\nWireless Internet worked vey poorly - unacceptable for a hotel catering to business clients\nBugs in room -yuck!\nWon't make the mistake of staying here again\nMarriott and Omni are far better establishments"
1,"Really wanted to give this place a try because my husband wanted to go for weeks now. The food looked good, smelled good but the service was too damn slow. \n\nThe idea of mixing and matching is really the only excuse to give this place one star(besides the fact 0 isn't an option lol)\n\nFrom the time it took me to place my order and then to check on it, my lunch break was already over. And the food wasn't even ready for take out. \n\nThankfully they gave me a full refund, but there's no need to take 25 minutes for one order. \n\nIt must be good if the girl at el pollo loco told me to try it. She told me to call ahead to save myself the wait. Hopefully we can try this out again in a few months!"
1,"Why are there almost 5 stars for this place? I went here last night because of the high rating. I got there about 40 minutes before they closed. The service was fast... But the food was greasy. Greasy quesadilla, Greasy tacos, Greasy loaded potato. Ma'an I'm not coming back, & fear the backlash!!! IYKWIM"
1,"Disastrously bad service. Dishonest staff and every time you turn around some guy is trying to tell you that your car can't just be washed, the oil can't just be changed.  No you need a clay bar detailing, you need a new windshield, you need the engine flushed.  My Range Rover was fully detailed, serviced and inspected by the dealer four months ago - but car wash guy wants $50 more.  They misled me on oil change cost, not by a little but by $50.  Misled me on time it would take for oil change and car wash, oil change took an hour and I had to skip the car wash entirely.  And finally, for God's sake, can there be just one car wash that doesn't have a skeezy guy telling me I can get a new windshield for free?  My windshield doesn't have a chip or a crack in it and Francis & Sons is telling me dust pitted my Pilkington glass windshield.  Really dude?  Really?"
1,"I was under the impression that all the businesses at Westgate wanted the Coyotes to stay in Glendale. That must not be the case with McFarlane Toys since they were locking up 10 minutes before closing time. Maybe I would buy this on a non-game Tuesday night, but a Saturday night, just as 15,000+ fans are pouring out of the game and into the mall?? Bad business model Todd, if you ask me. The funny thing is that during the hockey game I had just commented to my friends how smart it was for the Coyotes to start games at 6pm to help the businesses outside of the arena. I guess that idea fell on deaf ears. So needless to say, I won't be back (is there a way to do a ZERO star review??)"
1,Found this review in my drafts... It's been about 3 years since I went there.. Who knows if it's eve still open...was gonna delete but after reading it I remembered how mad I was and decided to post!\n\nWorst customer service ever!  Called in to go order 30 minutes before got here to pick up and waited for 45 minutes for my order... Guy at counter either hates his job or just doesnt care about anything... People in and out never once did any staff  say hi or how can I help you and everyone had to wait at the counter for him to return because he was never standing there... Never to return...
1,I would make that a negative star if I could.  Worst customer service Ever.. oh wait what customer service.  Noone even acknowledged that I was in this location everyone around me was being talked to but not 1 person said anything to me. Will never step foot in there again
1,"I am working on a quilt  and was trying to color match the pattern I had. I found someone, her name was Gail,  and asked for help. After a dramatic sigh she went over to the section and said this is all we have and I asked if I could find more online and she says I don't know you'll have to look. .. So I walked away and took my business else where."
1,"Well my rice was crunchy. My black beans hard and flavorless, my tortilla was sticky and I got mostly dark chicken in my burrito.  Ugggggh!"
1,Eating at this restaurant compelled me to sign up for yelp. It is outrageously overpriced (even for Vegas) and the quality is lacking. We had a party of 8 and there wasn't anything being enjoyed. The Dim Sum platter for seemed to be microwaved as the dumplings were unevenly heated and lacked flavor. One guests Pho was thin and the meat was super fatty and tough. The shrimp in all the dishes was fishy and mushy. Service was poor for how empty the place was. My beer glass was also washed poorly and looked like the previous beers foam dried on the glass. \n\nP.S. \n\nI would like to know if anybody has ordered the $175 Birds nest soup.
1,"Average wait time for delivery is an unsympathetic hour, even around 2 in the afternoon. Their new website's ordering system charges you additional fees for usage. The pizza is decent, but it's not worth the headache."
1,"Get ready to pay 2 times any normal Starbuck.  Drip coffee grande (med) was $4.20.  I like my Starbucks, and I do drink it daily, but give me a break."
1,I keep trying to give this place second chances but it never works out. I always end up disappointed by the overpriced meals and the terrible service.
1,"Of the Michaels in Charlotte this one is probably the one I like the least.  The store always looks terrible, but that is partially due to it being an older store.  The other reason the store looks so terrible is because its a mess (empty and disorganized shelves)!  I'm not sure if this store is physically smaller than the other Michaels in the area, but it definitely lacks selection.  Lastly, our cashier wasn't friendly and seemed like she was being in convinced by having to ring up customers.  For these reasons I generally go to Hobby Lobby or wait until I'm on the other side of Charlotte to go to a different Michaels."
1,Just brought my CRV back to the shop to get my A/C checked after it blew up on the freeway after they replaced it 2 years ago June. \nWith me luck
1,"This place was very disappointing for takeout.  I ordered a garlic naan and chicken tandoori.  It came in a small, under-portion white box, but that was just the start.  The chicken was yellow and pink on the inside- no tandoor char marks, no complex flavors.  The onions were raw and uncooked.  Generally disappointing considering how good the photos look for dine-in."
1,this 1 star is for the service alone!  they wouldnt sit us for some f'ed up reason.  we walked in and were offered inside or out and when we said outside she said well its pretty sunny we said umm ok inside she then said it will be 15 minutes.  mind you there was not one soul indoors.  another 2 ladies walk up and got sat right away!  really?
1,This poor review is strictly regarding my experience with the tennis courts. I played a tennis match here and found out from my opponent that almost ALL the courts have dead spots where the ball dies.\n\nI would not recommend playing tennis matches here unless they fix the dead spots.
1,"How are you going to make me sit in the drive thru and repeat my order 2 twice because your too busy laughing to what someone said inside and not paying attention to the people who are waiting patiently. And on top of that because your laughing so hard when I get home and check my food to start eating with my family. I look at the receipt and the food on the counter and you forgot my French fries. Yea maybe not the biggest thing to worry about, but I paid for them and you didn't give it to me."
1,"Disappointed! Menu looked good but very expensive. The food was average. I can see no justification for their prices. Our main entrees were delivered to the table before our appetizer and salads. I can understand having problems if it's busy but it wasn't. I'm very disappointed in everything about this restaurant. We won't be coming back unless we have to, and if we do, we'll make sure we eat somewhere else first."
1,"I was coming here weekly to get an Oxygen session. I'm a local so even referred people. Bought an $11 can of Oxygen and went to take it back and the horrible experience of not being able to EXCHANGE IT was enough to NEVER come back. They obviously won't be around a long time if they choose money over service. You just lost a consistent customer and they didn't care. Don't waste your money. Also, go buy a \""Tens\"" unit at a Medical supply if you want a massager for half the price of what they are selling a massager for. It's a BIG waste of money!"
1,"First, let me say...I changed my mind and maybe that is why the customer service went down the hole. I'm sorry to say. \nI came in for an oil change and a wash. They tried to sell me an exterior and interior cleaning. I initially said yes because I was going to surprise my husband, but my husband convinced me to not do it.\nI told them and they changed it on the bill. I paid, but now my car is sitting outside not being serviced while the mechanic( who was suppose to give me a list Of the things That needed to be maintained for my husband) is eating red hot candy and chatting with his coworkers. \nNow, I get it. I might have messed up their\nplan. \nBut I'm still the customer. Right?"
1,"I dont mind other locations, but this location on this particular night sucked huevos.\nI dont find the need to ever go back. \nTOTAL LATE NIGHT BUZZKILL."
1,iT'S  OKAY. We did not buy anything due to the long lines! What a waste of time!  Not a good shoe selection!
1,"Nearly every single time I come in here, it is an eerie experience.\n\nIt's just like any other Target, but more crowded. I can deal with that.\n\nWhat bothers me is the cashiers. In fact, I can only think of one time I've come in and had a decent cashier (I go there quite often). They're like mindless zombies--  I understand that it's a monotonous job, but I've never encountered something like this. They never actually acknowledge that I'm there. I go up to the register with my things, and they don't even make eye contact. They just go through the motions of a transaction. No hello, no telling me my total, no good-bye, not even the slightest glimpse of acknowledging me as a human being, not even when I speak to them. Even self-checkouts are friendlier than these people."
1,"We were in town for work and myself and 3 coworkers went here for lunch.  We arrived at about 12:10.  The restaurant was small and clean.  The server wasn't overly friendly but that was only the start of the problems. Two of us ordered the same thing, and the third and forth ordered different things.  The waitress returned to tell us that they were out of what the two of us ordered, and what else there were out of, which was about 6 other things. The sandwich I ordered came with a bean salad.  I passed on that.  My sandwich came cold and drowning in pesto.  She never returned to ask how things were so I didn't have the chance to send it back. When she came back to bring the checks we all had empty glasses.  At this point I let her know that it was cold. She didn't apologize or anything, just took my plate.  She ended up taking 20% off my check. Considering I ate half the sandwich and didn't get the bean salad, I figure she should have charged me only 20%."
1,"Our experience here was a train wreck. Complete incompetence. On the plus side, The store is relatively clean, competitively priced, and no one was rude, but we picking up the order we placed online (that should have been waiting for us) was a scavenger hunt. \n\nFirst, the customer service person told us to go to the computers department, but on our way there, we saw a sign for networking and figured our router might be there. The employee in that department told us our router would be at the cashier but the modem would be in the computers department (not together for some reason even though we ordered them together). At the computers department, we couldnt find anyone to help us, so we went to the cashier. When we got to the cashier (after waiting in line), she was confused and needed a manager to tell her that our order was waiting back in the computers department. We waited for her to walk back and get it. We were surprised when she asked for a credit card even though we had entered that already online. Apparently they don't charge the card until you pick it up (in case you don't have the patience for the chaos, perhaps?). Lastly, the cashier told us they didn't have bags when we asked her to bag our purchased items. We managed to convince her to put each item in its own small plastic bag. Far from ideal, but we managed to eventually get out of there with what we needed."
1,"I ordered online, when I went inside to pick up my pizza the gal at the desk seemed like she hated her life and made me feel as if I was inconveniencing her.  \nUpon biting into my pizza, I was immediately sent back in time to the days of school cafeteria pizza.  My husband agreed.  It was not good to say the least.  \nI would say little caesars over these guys any day for a cheap pizza."
1,"NEVER go here.  This place will rip you off eventually.  I sent a friend here who knows little about cars - she told me the customer service reps were making prank calls to other stores as she was waiting for service.  THEN they installed the wrong size tire on her car - four of them, in fact, which could have damaged her struts.  WHY?!?!?  \n\nAfter her experience here, I realized that they had failed to follow basic instructions of mine when I had bought several new tires, with the end result that I drove around for six months with no spare tire (partially my fault, of course, I should've checked that the tire floating around my trunk held air - I might've noticed the large gaping hole in the tire at some point).  I hereby resolve never to return to Discount Tire.  Apparently, they're managed by Neanderthals."
1,"Voted #1 Buffet for 6 years and it was in the hotel we were at for a conference. Why not? My husband and I don't normally like buffets but we decided to give it a shot. For the some 30 dollars a person it should've been amazing, but it was horrible. I don't think either of us found anything we liked at all except for the desert. The food was beyond bland. The voters who rated it number one must have been the elderly who hate seasoning!"
1,"Went to Aveda because I bought a groupon and thought I would try out their services. \n\nI am very picky about my hair so I opted for a deep conditioning treatment and a pedicure. The girl I had was going to do both services, she was very quiet and seemed shy. \n\nFirst, she did the deep conditioning... it takes 30 mins under a dryer to activate yet she decided to do my pedicure while the conditioner sat in my hair. She didn't want to cut my toe nails and instead said she was going to file them, they were still pretty long when I left. The pedicure was such a horrible 2 HOUR experience. She even told me she hates doing nails. I mostly listened to her talk about her boyfriend. \n\nAfter rinsing our the conditioner we went back to the station to dry my hair. I have very thick long hair so I told her she can blow dry until damp before using a brush. She didn't listen to me or the instructor who told her to use a ceramic brush to help my hair straighten/dry faster. After 1.5 hrs of blow drying my hair was STILL damp and wavy. \n\nI was very disapppointed all around, especially at the lack of supervision from the instructors. They came over twice the entire 4 hours I was at the school."
1,"I stayed here because it was on labor day weekend and i was attending my cousins wedding on the strip.  The strip hotels were over $200 a night so I could only afford a hotel in the $90 range on the weekends.\n\nThe room was big, nice, comfy, casino was good, resturant was good, free wifi.  The BAD PARTS is its in a sketchy hood. It's an outside hotel. Casino is seperate from the hotel.  It seems like a really trashy truck stop place, and i could hear the people having sex in the room next door, and I mean everything from the sound of the neighbors tv, toilet flushing to them having sex on the table. TRASHY!  I did tell the management and they gave me a refund of one of the 3 nights which was nice"
1,Horrible from the moment we arrived. We were sat away from the area were Asians ate at a Formica table with no table cloth or silverware!\nI ordered sizzling sea food which had 5 shrimps and the rest was mystery fish. my husband ordered crispy  duck which was so old and dried out that it was impossible to bite thru! He asked to have it replaced by cashew chicken. After an argument it came burnt!\nThey then tried to bill us for all three meals.
1,These guys suck.  They went WAY out of their way just to jack up the fare.  What should have been a 5 mile trip to our hotel ended up taking 3 times as long and cost $45.00.   We didn't realize it until we got to the hotel and looked on the map on our I-phone to see actual route driven versus what it should have been.  I assume they are hoping that none of their passengers have a clue.  I called the company immediately and the girl acted like I was the first one to complain of such a thing.  She suggested that I write a letter to the company.
1,"So....Went there last night with my 3 boys, fully intending on trying the 502 Fry challenge with them.  We had been to the website and were so excited, looked so yummy.  Anyway....we get there, no one else there, the one person  working there pretty much ignored us for 5 minutes even after I told him we wanted the Fry Challenge thing.  He literally didn't say anything to us for 10 min. while we stood there, he was on the phone talking, didn't even give us the \""be with ya in a sec\"" courtesy.  Very unhappy with this location.  We finally left and went to Metro Pizza close by and had a great dinner with them,  Maybe we will try the Tropicana location another time.  Horrible customer service at the Decatur location."
1,"Nineteen is truly the magic age for when this bar will be one that you actually voluntarily go to (and like it) .... all you need is a convincing fake and not a fake from the 21 year old entrepreneur who sold 5-12 copies of her driver's license to desperate minors. The bouncers notice that crap and chances are that 21 year old is a regular at Brother's anyways.  As previous reviewers have said, there is usually always vomit somewhere at Brother's... and unfortunately it is not usually in a toilet."
1,"Ugh. Absent service and super rude when he did come by. When we finally stopped someone else to ask for more water and our check, our waiter came over with attitude and excuses. As we ignored him and stood to leave he yelled sarcastically at our backs about whatever he had been doing. Food was 24-hour Vegas food. Blah."
1,"The atmosphere is great, but things go downhill from there.  I used to come here often and enjoyed the rolls--until they changed the happy hour menu to limited and not so delicious choices.  The \""daily\"" happy hour is so variable: if business is slow, they close; during weekends there is no happy hour.  This place is unreliable. \n\nAlso, s...l....o...w.... wait staff.  The food was sitting at the counter for a good 5 minutes staring at me.  I was about to pull a Larry David from \""Curb Your Enthusiasm\"" and pick it up myself, but thought otherwise.   Even if this is the closest sushi to my place, I don't come here anymore.  My new spot for sushi is Kobe Sushi Bistro on S. Rainbow!"
1,"Just got back from picking up the food. Horrible customer service. An employee pretty much forcing me to buy a drink after I said 'no' twice. Always rude service, this time my order was wrong n I called the first time and they said that I had the correct order and they no mistakes and put on hold for 10 min for the manager. I hung up and dialed again this time I sounded annoyed and got the manager quick. I was very disappointed more than usual. I DO NOT RECOMMENDED THIS PLACE UNLESS U WANT TO BE TREATED RUDE AND BE WRONG ON WHAT YOU ORDER."
1,Waited 20 minutes for fast food. I could understand if your busy but I was the only damn car in the parking lot! So needless to say after 20 minutes we left without food! :(
1,"During our recent trip to Las Vegas, we thought we would try Gordon Ramsay's restaurant.   \n\nWe had the French Onion Soup, Prime Rib, and Bangers and Mash.   Simple dishes that should be hard to mess up.   From cold soup to fatty prime rib and inefficient wait staff, the experience was horrible... and expensive.  \n\nI think perhaps Gordon should stop by and dine at this location - it does no justice to his name, and could benefit from one of his TV \""makeovers\"""
1,"THE\nC.omplete &\nU.tter\nP.oop\n\nTerrible coffee, overpriced, cheap styling, piss-poor in general.  The smoothies are normal and the pastries are OK because they bring them in from outside.  Don't be had by the exterior or the cool logo, you'll pay just as much as you would at any Vegas cafe, but you'll get very bad coffee from people who don't care about their jobs (or the customer)."
1,"After enjoying Darren's review of Betsy's Ice Cream I ended up their with my friend Joy who totally loves a good bowl of milk, cream, sugar, and flavorings. She wasn't impressed, and she didn't get much. They are pretty small servings for the premium amount they charge. I tried some sorbet, not bad, a little on the overly sweet side. I'll stick to Scoops on Beverly and Carini's Home Made Ice Cream down on Dormont Ave before I hit this place up again.\n\nJust a note: After posting my review I received an email through YELP from the owner(?) Manager(?) of Betsy's Ice Cream asking what I could do to get a better score from my review. He mentioned that he was training his staff to serve bigger portions but some staff just weren't getting it done on the front line. He also said would look into changing his recipe. My response to him would be to make sure the staff is trained BEFORE putting them on the lines to HIS satisfactory. You can buy an entire half gallon of premium Ice Cream for the four bucks Betsy charges for two tiny miniscule scoops. As for the sorbet, I'm not a fan and normally I would choose frozen fat free yogurt but I didn't see any. To me any sherbet is overly sweet."
1,"Tried once for dinner and it was just okay. Tried again for breakfast and hated it. Eggs florentine has about a teaspoon of hollandaise, unripened tomatoes and hardly any spinach. Hubby hated the turkey bacon and his toast was hard as a rock. Potatoes weren't cooked through or were overcooked and way toooooo much rosemary. Everything was cold. Fresh seasonal fruit was an apple (in August). Not sure, but coffee tasted like it was instant. And service is nonexistent, both times. Good concept, poor execution."
1,"Terrible service, Don't even try ordering ToGo. that is, unless you want to wait for 20 min when you arrive to pick it up.  I even showed up 5 min late from there timeframe that they had me for my food to be ready.  pretty ridiculous! I won't be going back.  Food was cold and soggy when I received it.  If I could rate zero stars I would have!  If youre reading this review and contemplating coming here...dont!  Never Come to this olive Garden!"
1,"This is probably the worst Ulta when it comes to customer service. I am not a needy customer and more often than not I prefer to be left alone to do my shopping. However, I do appreciate being acknowledged and I am even more a fan of having my questions answered in the event that I do need some assistance. This is not the case at this location. The salesgirls seem unfriendly and completely uninterested in helping/recommending/selling. I honestly wonder if being as unhelpful as possible is part of their job description. If it is, then they are doing stellar!"
1,"Alert: Possible Food Poisoning.\n\nWhile the staff is friendly and the food is actually quite good. I've now had diarrhea twice from this place. While its possible it was the spices, not ruling out uncleanliness given the past reviewers."
1,"Don't have anything nice to say about this practice. We have been with them for over 2 years and the service and quality of people that work there has decreased tremendously. \n\nFront of the house staff are incredibly rude, unhelpful and uncaring. You shouldn't really be working in an office that deals with parents and children all day if you aren't going to be able to put on a smile and be nice!!"
1,"Bad place to eat, tastes like dog food, bland and no taste, I swear they use canned dog food or some garbage, this place I will never go to again!"
1,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY  (unless you can get in for free ) OR YOUR TIME WAITING ON THE LINE (unless you can get in without waiting.)     TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE CLUB...EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING.   HAS BEEN CLUB.     \n\nThe decor and amosphere was mediocre, the crowd just o.k and the music ten years old.   \n\nGO GAMBLE WITH YOUR MONEY AND TIME... BETTER PAY OFF!"
1,"This is bay far the worst \""asian\"" food I have ever had the displeasure of consuming.  My group of 6 needed to have a quick lunch, and since we were staying at the hotel, decided to give it a try.\n\nWe each ordered something different on the menu.  I went with the beef noodle soup, while my friends tried the pho, broccoli beef, mapo tofu, pad thai, and some chicken stir fry dish.  To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.  They used the wrong sauces and the wrong noodles in each dish.  My friend that ordered the pho had to send it back (the first time he's ever had to do this at a restaurant).\n\nThis place should be shut down, then burned to the ground."
1,"We read the reviews and gave it a try. The atmosphere is fine and nobody was rude at all.  The service was good but the menu was not.  They were completely out of meat. Anything we tried to order was not available so we had to settle for a grilled cheese and fried fish.  Both were very, very greasy.  The bread tasted like old oil and the fish was dripping with grease.  We will not go back to give this place another try and will not recommend it to anyone.  One of the waitresses may come across rude but she is playing as far as I could tell.  To go is taking a chance."
1,"APS is a very bad company.  The default, tiered usage plan will have inexperienced consumers spending 6 times the normal price, per kWh.  They use a 3rd party CC billing company because they're too cheap to process CC cards - kind of sucks if you're forced to pay with an international CC that won't work for online payments due to the fact that the billing address is foreign and doesn't have a zip code because their offices won't accept CC payment in person.  I own a house in Las Vegas and have NEVER had any of the issues that I have had with this horrible company that I am forced to use. I will be terminating my lease upon it's expiration and the primary feature for my new rental will be that the house is in an SRP area.  APS is a very bad company and I will be happy to never deal with them again."
1,"Skip it and go elsewhere.  The guy writing work tickets asks how he can help.  \""Oil change and car wash please.\""  He mumbles something into his arm, shakes his head and writes $62.95 on the ticket, just assuming a $30 upsell.  Uhhhh, yeah - no kid.  Have a great sales career at the car wash, that's as far as it will be going.  On the plus side there is a nice waiting area with a fish tank."
1,We were here to buy a faucet for my aunt as a bday present. The man in the wheelchair in the plumbing department was rude and condescending. My husband is a plumber and knows what he is talking about and this guy rolled his eyes at us and tried to tell him he was wrong. I don't live here thank goodness. But my aunt does and said he was that way with her too. Maybe he needs an employee evaluation and retraining in customer service. End of rant.
1,This place sucks. They have 99cent store stuff selling for 5x the price lol save your time and go anywhere else
1,"I'm a vegetarian so there are not too many places I go to eat. I went to this place and tried their veggie turkey sandwich. It took about two hours for the nausea and stomach pains to start. I don't know, maybe food poisoning? I bet there are not a lot of veggies eating there so maybe the soy turkey was old and bad? It's the next morning and my esophagus and stomach are on fire. I can't eat or drink anything. Ouch."
1,"There are so many things wrong with this office, \n\n1st the front office staff and Medical assistants looked miserable and never once greeted me. \n\n2nd I saw a NP and explained that I needed my asthma medication refilled. I also asked her about some hyper-pigmentation on my face that has really started to bother me, I read in several places that hydroquinone cream is a first line treatment for darkening of this skin. The NP kept going back and forth talking to the doctor for about an hour, when I started to question her she said she was a NP in training and that her supervising physician does not want her to prescribe this face cream for me(you would have though I was requesting pain meds from the way she was treating me). this medication. Oh and instead of giving me my normal asthma RX that i always get they decided to change it to QVAR which turned out to be A LOT more expensive and I couldnt even fill the prescription\n\nso to sum in up, I waited forever, never got greeted, and left empty handed with no good explanation as to why"
1,currently staying here and this hotel sucks. customer sercies is horrible. we checked into our hotel room at 2pm with one of the beds slept in and ashes on the coffe table.  now its 1 am and after 3 calls and promises to send room service to clean the room they are still not here.  don't stay here.
1,"The decor is cool. I believe it's in the same location as The Gelato Spot. I say this since the main menu is focused on the sugary treat. But, that's not why I went in. I went in for iced coffee. YUCK. When I ordered an iced coffee, the cashier should have told me they didn't make 'em. Instead, he gave me hot coffee and a cup of ice. What? Uhm, that's not what I meant, bozo. Would I really want a hot coffee on an early June day? I don't think so, unless I'm just absolutely looney. I hear that's a possibility. In any case, the watered down coffee was gross. \n\nThat in and of itself is enough reason for me to grumble and moan about this place. It's doesn't deserve a second chance."
1,"I have been here several times and the food is very good, unfortunately I won't be back since this place clearly doesn't care about health codes.\n\nWhile waiting for my food, one of the workers who had been smoking and touching the railing outside came back in and without missing a beat continued to pick up the food with his bare hands (all I could think was, tell me it's not mine, but it was) and prepare the order.\n\nJust like the Seinfeld episode, you'd think he would at least attempt to look like he was following the health code, but no. In plain view he was smoking and touching everything outside and walked right in without washing his hands. The man who I believe is the owner witnessed it all and said nothing. This place should be shut down."
1,Service seemed quite good but the meatball sandwich I ordered seemed to be lacking enough meatballs at least one-forth of the bun was empty lengthwise and the meatballs were small. They should either put on more meatballs of adequate size or serve it on a bun half the size.
1,"Shrimp and Grits were good.    (I'm from Louisiana,  so it may be an A+ for people not from the south).   We also had the blackened fish sandwich,  baked beans and chopped salad.  All of these items were awesome.   Why 2 stars?  Snotty and very abrupt young hostess.  Says 25 min wait for some and permits immediate seating for others who have no reservation.  Also,  the service did not match the good food.   These things matter."
1,I went to the new location on tropical.  We have been waiting for this burger place to open.  We went last night and it was packed.  Our onions rings were soggy and so was our burgers.  My burger was still slightly pink and not cooked all the way through.  It was pricey and i will not go back.  The service there was bad but they were so busy.  My soda had only carbonation and no dr pepper.  Very dissapointed
1,"Since my previous review last year, I've eaten at Haps quite a few more times.  After lunch today (a coworker insisted we go there), I think it's finally time to reduce this to one star.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, in short, it's because they cut every corner they can find.  I've already mentioned the terrible side dishes.  The flavorless mashed potatoes, the garlic-less garlic toast, etc.  The buns they use are terrible; it's dry, spongy, and completely flavorless.  The scoop of ice cream they put on top of the cobbler (which they charge you about $1.50 for) is that yellow garbage you get in those five gallon buckets labeled \""frozen dairy dessert product.\""\n\nAnd perhaps most indicative of their overall cheapness, they replaced the Henry Weinhard's root beer with that plastic bottled A&W crap some time last year.  Yes, I can tell the difference, and yes, that move alone cost them my business.\n\nFor the record, my lunch today (a pulled pork sandwich, a cup of cobbler with a scoop of ice cream, and a cup of water) cost me almost $12.  With a drink, that would have been $14.  For low quality food, those prices are unacceptable.\n\nI guess people in Arizona like this garbage.  If someone tells you this place has good food, you can rest assured they either have no taste buds or actually like bad food."
1,What a joke....Mario Batali has his name attached to this place? Overpriced finger food with mediocre service. We hosted four friends from France in Las Vegas; two of which own a very nice restaurant in Brittany. Thought 'Mario's' restaurant would impress them. We left after the appetizer without ordering dinner. Not looking for value but let's be serious; $ 24 for six cheese ravioli? Our guests were laughing at the slow service AND the food. No wonder the place was almost empty.
1,"Disclosure: This review is based on St. Patrick's day bar crawl. So most places weren't on their A game for being slammed, but then again they still get one star even with that consideration.\n\nSo what went wrong?\n\nTables weren't being bussed, so we bussed\nMenus were sticky from spilled beer\nTook 15 minutes to order drinks then 15 more to get drinks and order food\nFood took 2+ hours\nAppetizers came with the food, not before, making the wait even more agonizing\nTater-tot nachos had very few chips and not much cheese, mostly iceberg lettuce\nBurgers apparently only cooked well done\nBurgers also come with toast in lieu of a real bun\nSeparate checks are too much work, so we split the table 8 ways\n\nI have to stop, the more I go the higher my blood pressure gets. It was really awful that day, I wish I had just gone to Five Guys and been done with it (I ended up going later). \n\nGet your shit together. Oh and I still tipped the waitress, most of that stuff was the kitchen. Should always tip cause they don't really get paid by the restaurant."
1,Staying here reminded me of getting wasted and passing out in an outhouse and waking up wondering what the fuck went wrong.  Cheap and nasty - just be sure to stay out of your mind drunk when you are in the room so that all the germs covering everything will be sanitized by all the alcohol in your system!
1,worst customer service ever they ripped me.off and.messed up on my order. the stupid fat Chinese women needs to know how to speak English and should treat her customers better this is it in China
1,"Worst apartment I ever rented, worst management I ever encountered. As can be read in a previous posts the carpet is the cheapest possible, this is what you get with your $300 redecoration fee (non-refundable). The apartment was horribly disgusting when I moved in so I spent several days cleaning it. Appliances were old and not efficient. The grounds unkept all winter long, the entrance gate broken most of the time. Pool furniture old and again disgusting. The water was turned off on several occasions. They actually entered apartments to 'check' their conditions or cleanliness. The manager has this air of arrogance and apathy about her, unfriendly and unwelcoming. The grounds crew is the same. Office workers were actually fun and a large part why I decided to move here in the first place. But not reason enough for me to stay, Since the first month I started counting down till my contract was over and I could move. I was happy to the higher rent for the location, but despite the ever so popular saying location isn't everything. What a horrible mistake it was moving here, lesson learned and now shared."
1,"Worst service ever!  Do not waste your time!  Drove down from Chicago for the Bears game and went to ale house on a Saturday night with 6 friends.  We sat down and noticed the table was not cleaned from previous patrons,  so my boyfriend asked the waitress to clean it.  She agreed but never came back.  Then my boyfriend asked another waitress that walked past if she would clean it and she said sure.  To make a long story short, she didn't clean the table and so we asked for the manager.  The manager, D Sellers, showed up but only to make excuses for the workers.  He should have come with a rag in his hand!!  Poorly managed bar!!!!! I thought the manager would at least pick up a rag.  WE ALL WALKED OUT!!!! Never again! This place deserves 0 stars!"
1,"Who would have thought that you could serve such awful food and get away with it. We had the green tomato BLT - day old bacon and a greasy tomato on dry bread; the quesadilla wasn't any better, dry and poorly presented. But worst of all was the server had such long nails she could put the plates down properly, guess she was scared of breaking a nail - very unhygienic me thinks. Maybe breakfasts are better but avoid all else."
1,We didn't eat here. We waited a sec for a table in the rapidly emptying restaurant at 10:00 and they stuck us in a corner. Why pay for a view that you won't see? We left and went down to Mon Ami Gabi instead.
1,"I'm sorry but I'm not a fan of Olive Garden I think all their food is awful. It tastes like it was trucked in frozen and thrown in a microwave then slapped on a plate and served. even the bread sticks taste funny (good but funny). The service is always mediocre, I'm not impressed.\n\nSkip this spot and take yourself to Anzios Italian restaurant (locally owned) less than a mile away. There you can enjoy real Italian food and a friendly staff.\n\nStay away from this frozen swans-man food. Not that I have any issue with frozen food but I can make that at home myself."
1,"The people at the register were friendly, now onto my review.\n\nI thought I would try this place since it is one of the new places to eat around work. I ordered \""The BOX\"" and got it to go. I was surprised just how long it took to get my food despite there being maybe 5 or 6 people sitting down at the tables and nobody else in line. I asked if they had other dipping sauces since special sauces are always disappointing, and they don't have any. Seriously? Not even BBQ? You specialize in chicken fingers and don't have BBQ? Ok fine, I'll try your sauce. It was terrible, I ate an entire finger using it hoping that it would get better, it didn't. I had to go find some hot sauce here at work since the chicken itself was so bland.\n\nChicken - Not bad texture wise, but bland.\n\nSauce - Terrible. Get more sauces, the one you tout as the best doesn't have the ability to stand on its own. Asking others in the office its either a love it/hate it verdict, which essentially means those who hate it won't be repeat customers.\n\nFries - Did you get these from Fry's across the street? Crinkle cut bland fries, yeah that sounds like store bought.\n\nTexas Toast - Great\n\nColeslaw - Never been a fan, so no review here.\n\n\nApparently this place stays in business by those who actually like the sauce since everything else they serve is underwhelming."
1,"I do not get the concept on this place. Service is not the key, I fuel my two car every week and  pay at the pump most of the time but  if I need to fuel and pay cash this a nightmare!!!   The cashier is the Barista , If you happened to get in line with three guys in front of you , better start praying because it might take 8 minutes before you can pay for Gas!!!!  you are stuck between lattes and cupcakes,  in my opinion the need two cashiers at all time . Do not  kill customer service for trying to be fancy????????"
1,"Never Again.\nI stopped in after a late Yoga session and wanted to grab a quick bite. I had never been to Daphne's before so I was a little unsure of the ordering process. I asked the guy behind the counter (who did not say one word when we walked in) what he liked best on the menu. He just started and me and said \""i don't know\"". \nUmmm...ok. So i settle on a combo plate of falafel and chicken skewer (check out the picture). It took almost 20 minutes with no one else in the place, so I got up and asked for it to go. This pissed the mean guy off even more...\n The Falafel was obviously frozen and in the shape of a sausage patty. Huh?\nThe chicken skewer was TINY with dry chicken and burnt veggies.\nThe hummus wasn't even good and the pits tasted old and stale. All for $9 you have GOT to be kidding me!\n\nI really wanted to like this place cuz it's close to home, but I will never be back."
1,Only giving one star due to their ridiculous policy of not providing water cups. I asked for a cup of water and was given a cup. I looked at my receipt and I was charged for a drink! I asked about this and was told that water cups are only for children and the elderly. Non sense! He (Malcolm the cashier) could have told me before he charged me!
1,"Update: With a generous gift card from some kind of regional manager (in response to our comment card from the previous visit), we returned, for what will be my last time.\n\nFirst, they brought me my steak with the wrong sauce--their pepper sauce instead of the shallot butter I ordered. I sent it back, and they brought me the right sauce--with the wrong steak. Funny enough, it was the same Heinz Ward steak I'd been unhappy with in my previous review.\n\nThis time, in fairness, my steak was at least cooked a perfect medium-rare. I'm still unimpressed with the flavor of the meat itself, though. It just tastes a little watery compared to the stuff at other restaurants I've been to.\n\nI had three bites and stopped eating, and I am pleased to say that they didn't charge me for the steak. But again: At a place this pricey, I just expect my experience to be at least an B+, and I haven't had anything over a C-."
1,"Can I give negative stars? Do NOT eat here. Way over priced. \n\nI am an eggs benedict-a-holic. I love them. I have had alll kinds. These are by far the most bland eggs bene I have ever EVER had. We waited for 25 minutes for a table. Far too long when you can see more open tables then occupied ones. Im not kidding 40% full, 60% empty. \n\nThe potatoes were cold. The hollandaise was foul. it had no flavor. NONE at all. I mean I have had ones were some lemon juice is added and it's at least bare-able. But no. It was bland, tasteless, and cold. I told the waitress twice, this is unreal. Add a lemon squeeze and BOOM 10x better. And make sure its warm. You brought it out under a silver plate topper, but it was cold. \n\nSAVE YOUR MONEY! DO NOT GO HERE. GO wait elsewhere."
1,"Bad service sums up the experience.  You would think customer care would be elevated for guests staying at the hotel but that was not the case.  I experienced much better service and attitude from the staff at every other hotel except the one I was staying at, the Treasure Island.  (1) Spa massage expierence: mediocre, good massage, less than gratituatous/helpful front desk in several ways, (2) Sports bar tenders acted as if I was sitting down only for a free drink and treated me with their best ahole personalities [seeing as I spent many hundreds on food, gambling, their Cirque du Soleil show, the room, and the spa], (3) Check in: very long wait, (4) Ropes hanging down in front of your window to be used by facility's staff without warning/notice is normal as explained by multiple hotel reps, (5) to have champagne glasses sent to your room costs $10 + $4 service fee [glasses in their general store are $9 except you have to dress and go down and buy them], (6) Starbucks there doesn't take Starbucks gift cards, (7) etc etc etc.  Go somewhere else if you want more than a handful of employees to act as if they give a damn about being in the hotel service industry...  Mystere was great though."
1,"Hooters has a sign that takes up an entire side of their hotel that advertises their 24 hour $3 blackjack game. The funny thing about this huge ass sign is that it fails to mention that there is only ONE $3 blackjack table in the entire casino, and that is has shitty 6:5 odds, no re-buys, and that it will always be crowded. The casino here is small, sticky, and everything smells like chicken wings.\n\nIf you've ever been to a Hooters restaurant, just imagine all the worst and horrible things about it, stick a blackjack table in it, and allow people to sleep and stay in your restaurant. That's how bad this place is. At least by visiting this once, I now know, and don't ever have to correctly assume to never come back here again."
1,Tip for oreganos staff: don't make your customer wait an hour and a half for their order and then get it wrong!!! Thanks for ruining our evening
1,I have never been so disappointed by this place until now. I went here with my family and found what seems to be tin foil in my food! When addressing the waitress she was very nice about it and she went directly to the manager. When he came to our table first thing he said was he doesn't know how it got in my food and it wasn't part of the recipe. . Well no shit..and then he said he won't charge that on our bill.. well I hope not!! But instead he doesn't offer a new plate or anything and just smiled. Poor management.. even the waitress asked if we wanted something else after the fact. Never coming back again who knows what else is in there food!
1,"This place is terrible chicken bowl was cold and super hard chicken looks like it was cook 5 days ago never will I come back, a refund would be nice!!"
1,"I currently live here and wish I had never gotten into a lease with these people.  Our water gets shut off probably around every couple of months and that's being generous.  They're constantly turning the water off for the entire complex because some of the apartments are not getting hot water.  The water has been shut off probably around 4-5 times since I have lived here, and I moved in, in May 2011.\n\nDuring the summer when they shut the water off, there was also no A/C because it's all connected.  There is no running water as I'm writing this review!  I've had to call maintenance 4 times that I can remember since I have lived here.  Once because the doorknob came off the linen closet, twice because the garbage disposal wasn't doing its job and once because the shower head was so rusted that no water would come through it.  Once the lease is up, I'm out of here."
1,"Had a big take out order of multiple dishes.  Yuck!  Not only is it pricey now, and the boxes are smaller but there is ABSOULUTELY no flavor!!  Not one of the take out boxeswerer labeled, so it was a mystery as to what you were eating.  Meat?  Where was the meat?  If there was a piece or two the beef was tough and grisly, chicken obsolete.  There was so much sauce I questioned if it was stew!!  Ordered the Kung Pao chicken and if I got it, which I don't know it all looked and tasted the same, there was no spice at all.   Crab puffs were the only saving grace and a reminder that I really did order from Chop and Wok. \n\nNever again will I order from Chop and Wok.  I have been a customer since I was in highschool  and am so disappointed that this legend has gone bust with crappy food! \n\nHope the owners really take a good look at these reviews as many of us are saying the exact same thing."
1,"Nice gym, management not so good be aware of the contract.  They will continue to charge you until you cancel in writing.  They slid a clause in about auto renewal"
1,been to this wendys a few times not the best customer service but its ok if ur really hungry i have not returned to this location since the redesign to the walmart in that complex (the reason is because they have a subway in walmart now)
1,"I stopped here after dropping off a package at the post office, which was next door and let me tell you ... This place is a RIP OFF! I got a single scoop of vanilla ice cream on a regular cone and paid $3.60! That's outrageous! That'll be the first and LAST time I'll be getting ice cream from there."
1,My husband and I decided to go to this restaurant for father's day. We were always happy with the food & service. Today on the way there I looked up reviews of this restaurant & 1 other. To my surprise I found terrible reviews involving a waitress reeking of cigarette smoke when she served their table. My husband told me that everything would be fine so we went to this restaurant anyway. imagine my disgust when I found the end of a plastic cigarette  wrapper in my diet pepsi! I picked it out because it looed like a slice of ice. Our waitress was very sweet and apologetic however management only took off our drinks & 25 percent which I feel is unconcionable. We won't be back.
1,I stopped in for a late lunch at about 2:30 in the afternoon on a Wednesday. I was the only person there. I was seated quickly and ordered a calamari appetizer and a small Greek pizza. I substituted the ground beef that comes on pizza for giro meet. I waited for about twenty minutes and had three glasses of ice tea before the waiter checked on my appetizer. I chief forgot or didn't make the calamari yet. So about seven minutes later the calamari came out. It was soggy and tasted like it was fried in burnt oil. The pizza came out shortly after. The crust on the pizza was hands down the worst I have ever had. It tasted like an opened frozen pizza crust that had sat in the freezer for to long. \n$7.95 for the Calamari\n$12.95 for the Pizza\n$2.95 for ice tea.\nWith tax it was over $25.00 dollars for food I would not feed to my dog.\nDo yourself a favor and stay away.
1,"Well after spending $15 on lunch ...how is it that you advertise hot dogs being your specialty and you don't have foot longs or sauerkraut, the food was mediocre and the wait was awful but at least we got to talk shit while we waited for our bullshit food ...you got one star instead of zero because the shake was okay ...peace !"
1,"I wish there was a way to leave a -5 star review. \n\nThe name of this place is actually \""Americas Best Value\"" Inn. For americas best value we recieved a neighborhood that looked like it was out of the movie Colors, dated furnishings and decor, putrid smelling and horrible stained carpet, an uncomfortable bed and a mildew ridden bathroom. \n\nWe usually stay on the strip but this was a family trip and we needed multiple rooms so we went for the cheaper option. There were no other rooms available in or near the area and we were 257 miles away from home otherwise we would have high tailed it out of there. \n\nWith no other options we drove to the nearest Walmart and bought all of the Lysol, bleach and  febreze that we could in order to attempt to sanitize this place. Nothing we did got rid of or even covered that smell In any of the rooms for more than a few minutes.\n\nWe will never stay here again."
1,"Absolutely horrible. I ordered a white wine spritzer, the server told me I don't think we carry that, I don't know these fancy drink names. I told her what it was and that it's been around forever. My wife ordered a frozen strawberry lemonade and got a regular. When ordering our food she laughed when I specified no poblano peppers or any spice. I ordered a weight watchers meal as I wasn't too terribly starving. When our food came she just assumed that my wife who is larger than I wanted the weight watchers. I was completely appalled. I spoke to the manager at once told her everything and explained we were leaving and I was paying for nothing. Next time I visit Phoenix this will not be where I go."
1,"It's ridiculous to call a number for a county facility like this and the phone number doesn't work properly! You can call the number but you can't get through to anyone because when you press the numbers when prompted for a department, nothing happens. You have to call police non - emergency. This listing is a complete waste unless you plan to go to this office directly!"
1,"I ordered delivery, it came very fast, unfortunately what they delivered was disgusting. I asked for no mayo, no ham, I got it with both. Not only that, the bread was wet. Completely inedible. Just threw away the sandwich, along with my money."
1,"Nice room. Huge customer service fail. Refused to award our marriott reward points for a stay because we booked our room in combination with our flight. We do this all the time and have never been refused our points, anywhere, ever. They also refused to upgrade my room despite the fact that we are gold members. Should have spent the extra $20 a night to stay at grand chateau. I intended to extend my stay here for 2 weeks but after this mess, I called the grand chateau and they allowed me to book online through my airline and gave me credit for my stay there plus they contacted marriott rewards on my behalf and had the credit for this hell hole applied to my account. Thanks Andrew (\""supervisor\"") for getting me such a great hookup at a Marriott that is twice as nice as yours."
1,"the worst hotel ever!!!! warning do not stay here!!!!! moldy sheets , stained sheets, tub felt like water under the plaster! carpet is sickning sheets had hair all over it....crumbs and rubbish pushed on the side of the night stand...we made them change our sheets at 11 o'clock at night and they were all huffy.just filthy......department of health needs to go in their!!!!! if u want to see pictures email me at cnjvape@gmail.com and on the subject line put days inn pictures. i be more than happy to send u photos...its not worth saving money on your trip i am dead serious. i regret stay ing their just to save money , now i have some insect bite on my wrist that is swollen and red....warning!!!!!! if u do belive me i will email u the pictures......"
1,"Food was really not that great.\n\nThe garlic shrimp appetizer, granted, it was good and ample, but the shrimp were overdone and tough.\n\nWe had two platos, I had a tamarind pork and my husband had shredded beef. \nTamarind Pork-It was a huge plate and portion, but the tamarind sauce was way sweet.  Usually, my notion of tamarind is savory.  The side vegetables were alright and the beans were decent.\nShredded beef-We both thought it had a funny flavor to it.  Once we literally got in to it, we realized it was green olive flavor, which we both don't like.  Other than that olive flavor, it was okay.\nMojito - good, but not great and it was quite small."
1,"Total manipulation at Las Vegas airport Advantage counter! Reservation was for noon. Arrives at counter at 11:25 and was told I was too early! I stood 50' away for 30 minutes. Then manipulated up charges! Make sure you rent what YOU want, not what SHE sells."
1,"Siri was on the news.  They were trying to figure out why they were recycling rice. \nhttp://www.ktnv.com/dirtydining/Dirty-Dining-double-dose-Siri-Thai-and-Island-Malaysian-Cuisine-221564581.html \n\nOkay, I lied.  I went back.  The pad thai was calling.  This was a stupid move.  We attempted to eat here again on 8/15/13, and guess what!?  The health district has closed them AGAIN!  Over 70 demerits.  NEVER AGAIN!  You are asking to be hospitalized if you eat here.  \n\nWe have eaten here over a dozen times.  Walked by, tried to consider the Pad Thai, kept walking.\n\nThe Pad Thai is excellent here.  Sadly, you may be the second or third person presented with the same rice."
1,NO REFILLS NOT RETURNING. So charge me $1 to refill my $6 soda and call it even? These refill nazis wont refill popcorn or soda! I spent $30 on candy soda and popcorn and now you need another $6? Dont make me choose between a cold drink with ice and a warm drink  thats enough for the whole movie. Also the seats are dated and worn and just kind of disgusting. The theatres are never clean and the staff are rude. WELL worth the drive to Town Square where they have customer service AND common sense.
1,there are  5 factory recalls on my 2013 Escape and I was told it could take all day Gaudin Ford wont give me a rental while they do a factory recall. Gaudin Ford has gone down hill and this  year customer will go elsewhere. They do not deserve  1 star
1,"Whoever thought that mixing alcohol and volleyball together in a bar made a huge mistake. First of all, the doorman made my friend leave and put her purse in the car. This bar is very dark so if you want to go outside , beware of the flying volleyballs!  I was slammed in the side of my cheek while I was talking with friends at the table, I went to tell the manager that it was getting out of hand and he sarcastically said\"" you should sit somewhere else,\"". Well I will never sit anywhere at this bar ever again thanks to the way he talked to me. When I went back to the table to get my friend, a volleyball hit her in the neck.  We left before any other harm could come to us.  I'm surprised that no one has sued them......hmmmmm?  Also, one of my drinks had some vodka, the next one was missing alcohol,  very inconsistent."
1,"My wife and I had lunch here and were very disappointed in the food and prices. I don't mind spending $40 on 2 dishes of good mexican food but the good we got was horrible. The grilled fish tacos were super small, fishy, and just bland. The sides of rice were too salty and the beans were dry and looked liked yesterdays beans. The chicken salad also was bland and the dressing was just horrible as well. I was also disappointed on the 3 salsas that came with the chips. My local senor fish has way better food and salsas. \n\nThe only thing the was nice was the upper deck seating and the service. You can do way better for $50 after taxes and drinks."
1,This place is shady as.fuck. they tried to.over charge on bottles and some stripper hoes falsely advertised their price. The girls here are nothing special. Vegas is way better. Im fat and ugly but still not impressed . Avoid these shaddy aholes
1,"Just to show that it isn't just me, as one DumbAss that sent me a message saying. This place was only open 3 months for a reason, charging way too much for Crap!"
1,Beautiful hotel. So well done but the beds are really bad. Last night we were sleeping on two different levels with one side of the bed low in the valley and the other side high on the hill. I changed rooms right now hoping for a better bed but instead the new room actually has a broken bed! What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas?! I'm waiting now for a supervisor to come and take me on a tour of the rooms with new beds. I'll be checking out sooner than planned and never coming back!
1,"This BofA drive thru is the stupidest shit i've ever seen! \n\nWhy in the hell would you make two ATM'S together in one drive thru?! Why don't you make it next to each other and not in the same lane like 5 feet away from each other?! We waited in line to get cash for like 10 minutes because one guy was taking forever so it held up a whole line.\n\nSTUPID, STUPID, STUPID!!"
1,"I've ordered cans of pro sheen in the past, and no problems. this time 2 cans were defective. tops broke off and it was dripping out,so i cant ship it back..(post office wont go for that) I've emailed Ryans twice about it and haven't gotten a response.its been a month or more now. Ive found another company that carries similar spray. really disappointed in them .bad costumer service."
1,"This place is definitely a place you dont want to go to if your looking for a job. I went in for a Wednesday interview she said i will wait sometime for the other manager to setup a second interview because the first one went okay, i waited a few days till monday, called back some chick answered saying they dont talk about employment on the weekends and that its extremely busy? Hello its monday. So i called today (tuesday) and they put me on hold for 20 minutes and some girl answered the phone asking if i needed help i said yes i have been waiting for 20 mins to talk to a manager? No one told the manager that i wanted to talk with them so she immediately transferred me to her , her saying that they will call me when its easier   to them.  And hurried off the phone. These people are so rude when it comes to employment."
1,"This restaurant replaced the Wendy's that was once here, and is currently the only option for food in the D-terminal. I ordered take out once, service was terrible, and I'm never coming back.\n\nI give it a try, so I order the Torta del Barrio to go, with fries. It's a vegetarian option for $13, including cheese stuffed peppers among other vegetables. One gentleman was in front of me, so I wait after my order.\n\nThree people order after me within 15 minutes, each ordering items on the menu of similar preparation (one even got the same dish). They were ALL SERVED BEFORE ME! I ended up waiting for 35 minutes for a meal that wasn't even that good. The fries were soggy and bland, and the bread for the torta tasted stale. No way that cost $13, I could've made that for under $5.\n\nThe restaurant didn't look that much better. The place was packed, and they pumped out a couple dishes every 10 minutes. The majority of tables were not served the entire time I was there, and they definitely ordered before I arrived.\n\nWhen you're trying to fly out, you want a quick bite to eat. The 35 minutes wait was inexcusable, especially since all those customers were served until I was dead last. The most I got out of the cashier was \""Sorry, I tried.\"" If you're going to serve food at the airport, that kind of service won't cut it.\n\nI've never said this before, but I'd have preferred fast food at the time."
1,Wish I could give them 0 star reason being we walked in and sat for 15 min for a table the workers saw us walk in but did not even approach us ...... We approached the waiter after they sat a couple that came after us and we were sitting for 15 min
1,"My chicken sandwich didn't taste very good and the amount of chicken was really skimpy compared to the $7.00 I spent for it. My son liked his burger. The cashier girl who handled our money was also handling and filling the to-go cups for the sauces and if you know anything about touching money and germs, bacteria, and sanitation, the fact that she did NOT wear gloves completely grossed us out!!!!!"
1,I'm sorry but I wouldn't go back here. Location is kind of hidden in the back of a shopping center. I had a gift card from restaurant.com and thought this place was worth a try. For one the pizza isn't Chicago deep dish pizza as advertized. It is super thin and not that good at all-tastes like cheap frozen pizza. Service was extremely slow and server kept forgetting basic things like silverware/straws/etc..(granted they seemed to be slammed with only 1 server-hello management). We never got our appetizers until the meal came out and the server was just like oh yea about it. Sure you can get a ton for the prizing (big pizza pies) but it's not noteworthy food or service at all.
1,"They make their espressos with really old coffee. What resulted was one of the sourest espressos I've ever tasted. Avoid.\n\n** Update **\nI've just received a message from the owner refuting that they don't use old coffee and that I would not be able to tell unless I have access to his order forms.  Fine, I can't PROOVE that old beans were used, but that's certainly what it tastes like. If you like drinking sour espressos, this is your place!"
1,"Way too many people in a small ass area. Line for drinks take forever. \n\nGo to the regular pool, the workers walk around and take your order, then bring your food/drinks to you. Much better experience"
1,"I was disappointed about the service. It took about 45 minutes for our food to get served, which is so unusual for Chinese rest. The food was not great, the lettuce wrap was the worst I've had so far. I will never come back to this place again."
1,First of all the portions are small for Persian food. It tasted horrible. Nothing special. They even bring your sodas in a can. For the price you could have very good food in Southern California. I haven't found a good place in Las Vegas for Persian food at all
1,"I'm going to make this simple and sweet.  \n\nI'D RATHER EAT AT KFC'S THAN EAT YOUR CHICKEN THAT COMES ALONG YOUR CHICKEN AND WAFFLES -- AND THAT'S SAY'N SUMTIN!  (Chicken just tastes like batter.  Where's the seasoning?)\n\nFeel free to tell me why their Chicken and Waffles is so amazing.  Just try.  \n\nThey serve you so much, I bet whatever gets thrown away is enough to fatten every malnourished child in Africa.  I propose we start a Hash House A Go Go food drive and donate all your leftovers at the door.  \n\nYAY FOR ENDING WORLD HUNGER!!!"
1,"Husband and I have been dining here since they opened this location. We both ordered the enchiladas and paid the extra $2.50 for adding beef and $2.00 for chicken. The beef enchiladas virtually had no beef. The chicken one was slightly better since did get 3 small bites of chicken. We are unsure if the beef was just cooked away in the process. They were blobs of doughy corn? tortillas with cheese. There were cold spots in the middle of my dish. Anyway, the meal was $37.00 bucks. Service was okay. We will not be going back again."
1,"I RUSHED to tan today after work. I got to Yolanda's at 7:20PM, only to find that the salon was closed. Both the sign on the door and the listed hours on the website state that Yolanda's tanning side is open until 8pm. I'm pretty pissed that I wasted time driving the whole way from Monroeville to Bloomfield for nothing. I've spent money on (multiple) tanning packages here, but I will definitely be taking my sad, untanned booty somewhere more reliable from now on."
2,"Back for another splendid Sunday brunch review is Mike P and Ashley D!!!! We embarked for an adventure at the Original Sunrise Cafe as we were both starving and unable to use our restaurant.com certificate at Hash house on Sundays :(.... boo.  Anyway to the review:\n\nThe Original Sunrise Cafe was packed! However, with good luck on our side we were seated in about five minutes.  The cafe had a nice vibe and was filled with people.  Fresh coffee was....well....Vegas cafe coffee; nuff said.  After a few glances around the menu we both noted how they covered several breakfast categories but only offered a small selection for each. \n\nWe both decided on omelets and OSC offers egg white versions of every omelet.  I have to say that my omelet the Eggzilla (Egg whites, spinach, roasted peppers and salsa topped with sunrise garlic sauce and jack cheese) was pretty good.  Although, Ashley D's omelet was nothing to write home about; sadly.  Overall, for $8.99 they come with a bagel/toast on the side making it a decent deal.  I just think for the amount of breakfast/brunch locations you can do a little better."
2,"compared to the locations in missisauga and toronto, the waterloo Burriot Boyz was not up to par, maybe because its so new, it just seemed a lot less tasty then other locations."
2,"I had the pulled chicken on country bread, he had the pulled pork sandwich. I wasn't impressed.. the meat was too saucy and the sauce didn't have a great flavor. The guy behind the counter was very nice and helpful for us newbies. For me, the food just didn't cut it."
2,"My friend n I have been wanting to come here for a very long time but sadly we were extremely disappointed. \n\nDecor: Tables are ugly. Decor on general isn't cohesive.\nDrinks: Worst bloody mary I've ever had.\nBrunch: Split the eggs Oscar. Asparagus was cold and the hollandaise was a little on the thick side.\nService: Our server Kristopher was not in a good mood and frankly turned us off from the very beginning. He might want to try smiling... Just saying \n\nSadly not impressed, maybe we'll just come back for beers."
2,We happened to stumble upon this place walking downtown and figured since it's surrounded by businesses that it would be a quick lunch.  Boy were we wrong.  The staff seated us quickly and took our order but then we waited...and waited...\n\nFinally the food came out and it was mediocre at best.  The Cajun Chicken sandwich was a chicken breast with something that may have resembled paprika on it.  It tasted like cardboard and the roll it was on was hard.  It was served dry with tomato and lettuce if you wanted it.  The curly fries were surprisingly good considering the sandwich.  It took quite some time to pay our bill and the serve staff kept walking around talking about how they were short staffed and their last table didn't leave enough of a tip.  I understand that's frustrating but in front of other patrons seems a little...offf.
2,"Like the optometrist!  When I wanted to use my vision insurance, they printed out a benefit statement (when I asked).  It appeared to be legit as it had my plan name on it, but the benefit amounts seemed too low and they informed me that was my plan's benefit.  I went home and checked at my benefit was SIGNIFICANTLY higher!  I then went back ane explained that they has miscalculated my benefit and that's when they admitted that they are actually out-of-network for insurance plans, \""but it all equals out because we charge lower prices.\""  Hmmmm....so I then go to west valley vision which was less for contact lens and they game me my full benefit (wv vision did seemed higher for frames, though). I don't appreciate being lied to!"
2,"Pitcher of sangria $36!? Extremely hard to understand the waiter while he explains the specials. Also, his recommendations were way off! $50 per person or the prix fix -paella and tapas. No thanks, I'll pay $20 for paella for the table and get individual tapas for each person. \""Well the $20 paella usually serves just 1\"" he said. Well I'll be the judge of that. I order it, it comes, a huge skillet with rice, 5 shrimp, 6 mussels, 6 clams, chicken and sausage. ALL 4 of us couldn't finish it. Not an enriching experience. In my opinion."
2,"I thought I would try someplace different than my regular place, and boy was I disappointed.  Not only was it 50% more expensive than the place I go to 2 miles away, their service was less than stellar.  The pedi was the worst I have ever had, and the nail tech wasn't all that attentive.   I won't be going back."
2,Went here a couple of weeks ago late night with some friends. Service sucked! We had to constantly flag down our servers. I say servers because they kept taking breaks and switching out. The pizza was OK and the wings were fine.
2,"Update:  The money was remedied, so I gave it an extra star for that and just having a great time with my friends.  \n\nWent out to party in Vegas last week for Pre New Year's Eve celebration at Blondies. Somebody had to screw something up. The i***t bartender charged us for another party's bill of $138.00 ON TOP of our own overpriced bill!!!   And it is not like we signed for that bill either.  We didn't notice this until 2 days after when we checked our account. Husband did call the manager said to get back to them as they are sure that bill should be refunded back to our account (of course that bill will first be deducted from our account, good thing we are not poor people).  I guess they have a tendency to do this to their clients...so people beware of this carelessness."
2,"I feel like there are three things important for a club: music, crowd, and drinks. \n\nWhiskey plays decent music. Some days better than the others depending on the DJ. The crowd is alright too. I feel like if you go with a good group of friends, even the worst club can be super fun. The drinks are not bad, decently priced. \n\nIt's pretty casual and it's a big space right in the middle of the EpiCenter. \n\nMy advice: get a fun group of friends and you are all set!"
2,"I just went here for morning coffee for the first time. I ordered a hazelnut latte. The service was very nice and all was well, until I took my first sip later in the car. Ewwww. The coffee is completely burnt. This made my usually slightly sweet latte into a nasty bitter mess of disappointment. $4 later I have to throw this away and buy a new one somewhere else. It's completely undrinkable."
2,"I spent a lot of time at Canaletto in the early 2000s but was disappointed with it when revisiting it this past week. Ten years ago the food was authentic and beautifully presented, but the other night the best praise I can muster would be \""passable.\"" None of the five in our party felt that they had anything special. \n\nCanaletto, with its \""outdoor\"" seating in the Venetian's version of Saint Mark's Square, is still a nice enough place for an American, albeit uninspired take on Italian food. But with so many better food choices in Vegas I can recommend it no longer."
2,"Um. What did I miss?\n\nThey have such great reviews but my experience was just \""meh\"".\n\nI provably should have known better then to order entr\u00e9e seafood at a fast food type place, but the picture was really appetizing!\n\nVolcano blackened mahi.\nWaaaaay too salty. Had to scrape off most of it. The fish underneath was OK fresh. Not ocean fresh, but Arizona fresh. :-)\n\nI had veggies that I thought would be steamed but were definitely stir fried. Also OK fresh.\n\nThe biggest let down of this was the \""mango cheesecake\"".\n\nI was expecting some kind of mango inside the cheesecake, but, alas, it was just plain old cheesecake with.... get this... \""mango puree\"" on the side.\nIt was a thimble full of mango juice. And fake mango juice at that.\n\n*sigh*\n\nI would eat here again, but I will definitely lower the bar before I do."
2,"Not very good. 25 min wait for what should be somewhat fast food. The flavors were not very good on any of the 4 items we had. I'd suggest they reevaluate the menu and then figure out how to be more efficient. People will forgive slow service for good food, but this place is a bust on all fronts."
2,"2 Sterne f\u00fcr das Ambiente, mehr kann ich leider nicht geben.\n\n\n Wer mal wissen m\u00f6chte, wie bescheiden ein Caipi mit wei\u00dfem statt braunem Zucker schmeckt, ist hier bestens aufgehoben. Au\u00dferdem braucht man sehr viel Zeit, die Bedienungen sind unfreundlich und unaufmerksam.\n\n\n M\u00f6chte man einen \""Tisch\"" reservieren, muss man erst mal einen hohen Mindestgetr\u00e4nkeumsatz pro Kopf vorstrecken, damit man eine Reservierung bekommt.\n\n\n H\u00e4tte Karlsruhe eine Konkurrenzlocation mit dem selben Flair aber besseren Cocktails und freundlichen Bedienungen, h\u00e4tte das P10 sicher zu k\u00e4mpfen!"
2,"Hmmm, this Canter's really didn't knock my socks off at all. As a matter of fact, I think I left feeling a little under-whelmed. \n\nThis is a branch of the famed Canter's in LA on Fairfax and I was expecting a lot more. For around $15, I got a turkey on wheat, fries, and a soda. MAJOR UNDERWHELM-MENT. While there was a gang of turkey, it was dry, limp, and tasteless. Only when I slathered dijon mustard on it did I feel like my $15 went towards something.\n\nOH WELL. I do realize this is in Vegas, the land expensive meals. I did try another person's pastrami and it was pretty good. Again, I suppose that nasty turkey sandwich killed it for me. \n\nMy tastebuds may have been shot from the late night prior, so I guess I will someday return to the REAL Canter's in LA and hopefully see what the hoo-ha is all about. I will not be returning to this Canter's sadly!\n\nPlease, dear God, please let me be more impressed with the real one."
2,really? seriously needs an update..looks exactly like it did in the 70s when the mobsters had run of Vegas..smells old when you walk in the door..staff was nice but the building itself? not so much...i see why they are one of the cheapest..
2,"I live right by SMG, so its very convenient. But there are two major issues I have with the place. \n\n1. The food needs to get better. I have tried 5 different items and none of them were good. Its usually over done and extremely greasy. \n\n2. The seats are not good. I would rather sit in a regular movie theater seat that actually reclines, than the bulky uncomfortable seats at SMG."
2,"Although the food is tasty the menu is unclear and the \""alll you can eat\"" is hardly all you can eat!! There are loop holes all over the menu that limit what you can choose and how much you can have!  The dessert is apparently one item per person although it is not stated anywhere!! In addition there are items reserved for dinner only but it is listed nowhere on the menu that they are off limits for lunch. I will not be visiting this establishment in the future."
2,"Kinda crappy but i would stay again on a budget. Their is a weird place in my hard for circus circus, it bad but not unsanitary. \n\nFirst, the people that do the check in are the most miserable humans in the planet. Did some one tell them to go as slow as possible? Seriously, it should take you no longer then 2-3 minutes to check me in.\n\nThe place is musty with smoke, i mean w/e i don't care that much but some people do. Their is a stale taste in the air. \n\nThe place as a whole is kinda cool, the look of it, the indoor activities like rick wall and extreme rides like you would find on the boardwalk.\n\nThe rooms, poor without being dirty. They are boring yes. Do i feel like I'm in the 70's yes. But they are clean so i cant complain too much. \n\nThe steak house inside is good but expensive. Avoid the buffet for sure (much better options in Vegas for same price)\n\nIf you are going there because you have too and your on a budget don't fret. But their are much better options if your going to do Vegas do it right!"
2,"This Gamestop store is basically like any other Gamestop store-- overpriced used games and consoles, horrible buyback rates, aggressive sales technique, and pretentious employees. Sometimes, when you tell them that you're not interested in becoming a \""member\"" or whatever their program is, they just keep talking over you. Do your game shopping elsewhere. eStarland has great prices on used games and consoles and great buyback rates."
2,"This is a new show at Planet Hollywood.\n\nThe show is a weird combination of impersonations, girls dancing and comedy.  Coop does a good job, it is just not a good mixture or flow to the show.  \n\nThe thing that bothers me the most about the show is the audience members that are obvious plants.  They laugh too loud and laugh at everything. This means to me that the show isn't very good or the show doesn't believe it is good.\n\nThis show could be really good if they would decide who their audience was and play to them.  They are trying to play to three different groups and missing the mark.  \n\nhttp://www.planethollywoodresort.com/shows/the-coop-show.html#.UqoFCX-9KSM"
2,"Pros- \n-ambience is nice \n-good sized rooms \n-nice view \n-fancy equipment \n-beds are really soft \n\nCons- \n-bad/rude service \n-wifi is basically worthless \n-showers.... its either you take a scalding hot shower or an ice cold one... \n-lighting is trash \n-expensive\n-balcony literally blocked of like were some kind of 3 year olds \n-The smell in the room is death...\n\nOverall, there are much better places to stay in Vegas where you don't have to pay these ridiculous prices and still get better service and a better hotel experience."
2,Unfortunately this place isn't what I was hoping for. The food is good and the cooks are great but front of house is really not knowledgable on their food. This is suppose to be a health kitchen so they should be able to modify my meals to what I need but simply don't know how. When asked what kind of squash is in one of ther signature dishes their response is idk. How do you not know? And if you don't why can't you find out? Same thing when asked what white dishes do you guys have? Is there oil in that sauce? What about sugar? These things are important for people on specific meal plans. It's frustrating when you do not know anything and seem too annoyed to find out. Though the food is good I'm afraid to eat it in fear that it will have something I specified I can't have. Both times I've been here had the same issue with the same girl. They need to be more knowledgable.
2,"My boyfriend and I have seen these Waffles Cafes all over town so we decided to try the  one by my house. I knew from reading the reviews that we would be dining off of paper plates and using plastic silverware. \n\nThe food took awhile to come out. We had to get our own coffee and water. I ordered the chocolate waffle with strawberries and banana slices. It was just okay. It really didn't taste like a chocolate batter. The plastic silverware made it difficult to cut my waffle. My boyfriend ordered a breakfast combo that had a waffle with peanut butter and chocolate sauce with a side of eggs and bacon. Both of us agreed that the bacon tasted like it had been cooked in used oil from the Chinese restaurant next door. Disgusting. His waffle was fine, but he didn't care for the eggs. \n\nThe grossest thing was when he went to put salt and pepper on his food. He picked up the shakers and they literally stuck to his fingers, all dirty with syrup and who knows what else on the outside.  \n\nWe threw our punch card that was given to us in the trash on the way out and will be making our waffles at home from now on."
2,"I've been to this McDonald's before but for today I'm giving it a lower rating simply because pretty much the entire restaurant was filled with flies. This McDonald's is situated in a nice location and the interior is elegant and kinda upsacleish, especially for a McDonald's and so far the staff is always nice and pleasant. But this time around, I don't know why but you couldn't even enjoy your meal becasue of all the flies. Not sanitary at all especially in a restaurant. Hopefully next time I come back they won't have this problem again."
2,"I had love for Parlor last year...but I have to update based on my recent visit this week. My husband and I decided to stop here for lunch and had the usual hour before we had to go back to work. Well we stood at the hostess stand for about 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged us! At this point, no one's frustrated. After being seated, we made our picks so that we were totally ready for our server...except...no one came over to us...for over 10 minutes! Now we're frustrated! I didn't mention this before, but it was not busy in there at all! After a couple minutes of eye contact with servers as they casually floated past us and even a friendly \""hand wave\"" in the air to one of them who looked right past us as though we were totally invisible, we left. We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!"
2,"25 minutes to get a shot,22 minutes for my cocktail..70 minutes for a chicken sandwich and pot roast..... The wait was just silly for anything I asked for, it was busy but still plenty of open tables.\n\nFried pickles good but wayyy too salty, Chipotle chicken decent. Fries were obscenely salty and barely edible. Chix quesadilla good but small portion. Margarita was pricey."
2,"I had been a fan of TP since it had opened.  Unfortunately at the beginning of my last visit, I was informed that they were \""tightening\"" up their policy on requiring a credit card up front in order to be served lunch.  Quite frankly, this rubs me the wrong way. I am sure that the problem of a few deadbeats leaving without paying is NOT a problem unique to Twin Peaks.  No other restaurants in the area shows this amount of disrespect to their customers. Its like they want you to come in their business and spend your money, but treat you like a crook in the process. No thanks for me. I don't care how good looking the waitresses are, or how the food is, I will not be back!!"
2,"They had what sounded like a good special for Valentine Day turned out to be a joke.  Food was of poor quality, and way over priced.  Food in the past was good here.  The place was always busy.  Recent visits not so.  Disappointing.  Cool place for at least drinks, now I dont even consider it as an option."
2,"I am disappointed because the sight of the pool really intrigued me. It was a nice environment, decent crowd, but I was pretty upset when I went to pay for drinks. We were charged $15 for two WELL vodka and diet cokes in short glasses.... A bit pricey but I was willing to go with it. Then we decided to take two shots of fireball, you know, the cheap stuff. The bill came and it was $16 for two fucking shots of fireball?? They get that for free and other bars literally give it away. On Mill they charge maybe $2 a piece for fireball. It is complete bullshit. Not even a real shot and they charged us almost $20. Will not be back for that reason. Such a rip off!"
2,Average at best. I am so disappointed. I ordered several items from menu. The onion soup is mediocre and very oily. The beets were quite good. The macaroni gratin side was average. A flatiron steak for over $40 is ridiculous and honestly it was not well seasoned. Bottom line: go to Daniel Boulud's or joel robuchon's restaurant. This restaurant was empty and a disappointment. I don't think it will be there in 2 years.
2,"I have only ever been to this Zizzi once and everything about it screams average, my friend and I only went because of a two for one offer that I'd come across. When we arrived at the restaurant, it took ages for us to get a seat because of the throngs of office workers taking up all the tables. Although the restaurant was physically clean, it seemed a bit grotty to me (like the way that a McDonald's is grotty). Our food was pretty standard; I had a pizza, which was freshly baked but could just as easily have been one of Tesco's Finest, and my friend had a seafood pasta, which was somewhat lacking in seafood. The service was alright, but not particularly friendly or quick. I don't think I shall be returning."
2,"For one of the largest hotels on the Strip, I expected a lot better from this place in terms of quality and service. Anyone who would give this place 4 or 5 stars obviously does not get out much.\n\nCheck out the buffet at Mirage. That place is money well spent."
2,"Cool atmosphere, but thats about it.  The wedding soup was cold and bland and the meatballs I had were dried out and without much flavor.\n\nI'll give it another try when the upstairs opens, but for now I'll pass."
2,"Rice was too dry, service was slow at best and for what we got the price was way to high. The decor was nice though but I can get better sushi from albertsons for a fraction of the cost."
2,"If you want to be frustrated and have a shitty time In SIN City Go here and waste your hard earned money. But if you don't want to have a Shitty time go some were else. \n\nThe people here all have there heads up their asses and are very inconsiderate. You cant find any one to help you out if you have a question about anything. The elevators take for ever and are packed tightly, So if you have a stroller or allot of luggage then good luck. Most of the skinny bitches look at you funny and shove their bonnie asses against you arm and is uncomfortable. \n\nThe only positive thing that the tiki bar had a crazy group of people hanging out and drinking. Some American , some English , and a Castro look a like. most English people don't no about Cinco De Myao. So in honor of the english guy we met Cinco De Mayo, my name is Sanchez , Dirty Sanchez. \n\nJust for that experience I will give them a second star."
2,"For lunch. I had Yuzu special.  I am native of the cuisine, and I think their menu style is offering small portion of many different food: many dishes.  Many dishes, but sorry not so impressed.  To me, considering food quality it is very pricey. Here, I came up that Mother is pretty good chef. I guess it is not for authentic Japanese food lover."
2,"No bueno.  Had an okay haircut here once that would have earned probably 3 stars including mediocre service. Went back again today for the same reason - they're open when my usual place is closed. Or so I thought. I called at 3:45 to make sure they were open, and the guy on the phone assured me I had until 5pm. When I got there at 4:10, he said sorry and pointed to the clock. When I told him I was the one that called, he unapologetically pointed back at the clock and resumed his haircut. I won't chance another lackluster haircut here. Instead, I'll go back to mid city, where the sketchy location gives way to cheap, quality haircuts with great service."
2,"I am only giving them 2 stars because of  they called me later and tried to repair what they did. We went in to work with John Cowan, he lied straight from the start and then 2 hours later we got a better deal on which we were trying to get done. My wife felt uncomfortable and told him so and he got mad at her and began to yell at her very loud in fact. I would say do not work with him he was rude and treated us like we stupid and insisted on telling us how much sales experience he had every 5 minutes. We don't care. Anyways the manger called us later and gave us an even better deal free oil changes for the lease period which was nice, that's why I gave 3 stars instead of one. We are also first time buyers so the maybe that's why he tried to rip us off."
2,"If you've never seen a male revue before, then you might make the mistake of thinking this is a good show.  It was very amateurish and sloppy. First of all, the men were not all cute. Great bodies, yes. But only 2 of the guys had good looking faces.  Second, they can't really dance and do the same tired moves for every top 40 song. Much of the show is actually \""empty\"" in that there's one dancer going through the crowd while everyone else is sitting there with no entertainment. In short, the show is lazy. There are some \""OMG\"" moments as there will be whenever men strip. But having seen Chippendales, this show is NOT worth $20, much less the $36 we paid from the 1/2 price ticket booth."
2,"boo World Market!  I came in here looking for the \""Hobbit\"" line of beers bc I wanted to buy them for my boyfriend to try on New Year's Eve (he called it New Beer's Eve and wanted to try a new beer that night).  I asked the man stocking the shelves if he knew where they were.  he was very friendly and went to look it up for me.  unfortunately, this store had not received a shipment of it yet (or maybe it never will, it was unclear to me).  but I specifically asked if ANY world markets in phx had them and he told me no. but I just looked online and it's available at the world market on camelback!  I totally could have bought it that night for New Year's Eve, lame."
2,"Do not get the taco salad!! Way too much guacamole and sour cream and it is really bland. Kind of a mess.  friendly service, cute little neighborhood atmosphere, but honestly the food is not impressive."
2,"My sleep-number bed and/or remote was broken (room 514), and by the time I fell asleep, the mattress felt swayed like a hammock. I liked the layout of the room, with the headboard against the wall to the bathroom, and the curved desk/dresser layout was different. My room was not restocked well after the first night, such as no fresh coffee supplies or clean glasses and mugs. I asked for no feather pillows when I checked in, but the replacements were floppy, the kind you have to wad up into a ball. Even though this is an airport hotel, catering to business travelers (free wifi, lobby bar, room service, business center), it had no taxis, ever. The front desk had to call one for me, which was a 15-minute wait. Not horrible, but not great."
2,Well.. I order a Enchiladas with adobada meet \nWas the most nasty adobada meet I eat \nThe waiter was nice when my husband and I arrive \nBut I'm still waiting still for my refill she never bring me anything\nI am very upset I did not enjoy my dinner was horrible \nThis location in Arribas  I don't have idea what they sale but I'm sure Mexican food they don't sale NASTY
2,"Should have taken a taxi.  The shuttle doesn't leave the airport until it's completely full.  We sat on the shuttle for half an hour.  Luckily, the first stop was our hotel--The Venetian.\nI bought a round trip ticket but waiting for the pick-up at the hotel to return to the airport was very stressful.  They were 45 minutes late and we almost missed our flight.  We called 4 times to ask where the shuttle was and the answer was always the same--\""it's 5 minutes away\"".  Other people on the shuttle later told us that they were at the Palazzo sitting in the shuttle for 1/2 an hour before they finally left to pick us up at The Venetian. (they are neighboring casinos). Again, they waited until the shuttle was full with no regard to the agreed upon pick -up time for us.\nIt's just not worth it.  The money you might have saved would have been better spent on a more reliable service.  You're in Las Vegas for god's sake--you're going to spend money anyway.\nLesson learned.  If you are not in a hurry, then this might be a good option as it only cost $12.00 round trip per person."
2,"Warning: Serious gut buster, proceed with caution!\n\nI would never have tried a place like this had it not been given so many glowing reviews (and it's close to work).  And to my chagrin, it was exactly what I expected.  Think lunch truck cuisine in a strip mall setting and you've just about nailed it.\n\n\nThe fry bread on the bbq beef sandwich was neither soft nor fluffy, it came across as a thicker, staler version of the chalupa tortilla at Taco Bell.  The meat tasted like that tub of pre-made bbq beef you can buy at the grocery store.  \n\nInside the restaurant it's as you'd expect, strip mall chic. Looking past the register into the kitchen it looked disorganized, the staff disheveled (although very nice and polite).\n\nThe dessert fry bread wasn't any better, same stiff tough texture under a sea of powdered sugar.\n\n\nWould not go back, would not recommend."
2,"Horrible horrible service.\n\nCame around noon on a thursday and there were 2 tables seated besides my table. The busser brought our waters and iced tea fairly quickly and then ten minutes later our server finally came to take our order.\n\nSo, we ordered a greek salad which came out pretty quickly and then we noticed that the two other tables got their pizzas right after we finished our salad. So another twenty minutes goes by and still no pizzas, finally after a half an hour our server came over and said there was a computer malfunction and that our pizzas would be there in the next ten minutes. Needless to say, the pizza was good which is why I gave it two stars. Other than that, I will probably never come back."
2,"I really wasn't in the mood for a buffet so I walked right past the one in the Excalibur on my way to see what Luxor had in the way of a coffee shop.  I wanted food cooked to order for me.  My food came out really fast.  I would be real surprised if any of it did not come from a warming tray.  The eggs were watery, the corned beef hash was dried out, I could only deal with part of the potatoes, the toast served wrapped in a basket was too cold even when it first got there to melt the butter.  The orange juice was really good and the decaf was ok.  \n\nThe service was good and friendly.  The chairs were comfortable to lounge back in but not very comfortable to sit up to the table in.\n\nOverall I was not really impressed paying $5 more plus tip for the same quality of food I could have gotten from the buffet."
2,"Can do way better. Service sucks. Definitely needs to be cleaned up way more. It's pretty ghetto, here. Definitely don't gamble here"
2,"Ordered delivery from this place tonight.  It took over 90 minutes (estimated 45-60).  The food wasn't hot, the rice was just blah, they didn't bring our eggrolls.  So - on their delivery service NO stars - on the food itself - hard to tell honestly - it didn't seem to be what we ordered as was described on the online menu.  Maybe they were just having a bad night but it'll be a while before we try again."
2,"i have tried three times on weekends to get in here, usually not in top form, i may have thrown up the parking lot once...sorry.\nbut on a sunny thursday morning i manged to get in without much fuss.\n\nusually the fussiness is outside, oh! there is shade now jane l. this makes sense because summer is ovah...duh. so anywho...screaming tots a go go. this is a tiny place...why would you bring your spawn here? i hear tell ihop has balloon animals? maybe you could have them fashion  an anchor shaped balloon creation to match your tattoo flash inspired t-shirt? \n\nthe choices here are slim but the portions are large as well as the amount of grease. hey i like grease...but like red grease dripping out of the back end of my burrito at 4 a.m. because in the gleaming light of the morning it makes me feel so dirty. i had the oats, surprisingly grease free and my partner in breakfast crime had the cheese omelette. i also ordered home fries on the side, some have complained about the rosemary...mine had rosemary, but it looked like it was accidental. pretty bland and boring. the entire experience was pretty bland and boring. i don't see what all of the fuss is about, sure it's good, but it's also breakfast...how hard can it be?"
2,"Got sat down quickly and had our orders taken. I asked for #90 and got #19. I waited and waited for our server to come back and he didn't after about 15 mins so I dealt with it and started eating my food. As I'm eating my sister points out a cockroach on the floor next to my feet, she tries to tell someone but they hesitated so she got up and killed it herself. We finally get the check to pay and still had not seen our server (didn't even bring our check) so we paid and left. The food is good but the service and atmosphere makes it difficult to want to come back. Two stars is for the food the cooks made!"
2,"Arrived and waited for 10 minutes before I grabbed a menu and asked an employee if the guests were supposed to seat themselves.. He responded \""You can\"" and walked by with out furthering assisting me."
2,"Long story short. The service was ok, brought me my Salad but no dressing. Ten minutes later my dressing arrived. It had a very odd taste. Salty,  but since I put it on the salad I just tried to eat it. My. Husband wasn't pleased with his food either. We have been there several times and really liked it. Something has changed and we won't back."
2,"The staff here are very nice and polite however, they are also stretched very thin so good luck getting the time of day from someone.\n\nWhile the line to order goes very quick the delivery time for your food is much lengthier than desired for the quality of food produced.\n\nMoving on to food, they are far below the standard of lets say...McDonald's.  There is nothing wrong with this however, when you pay $8 for a plate of tacos you expect an $8's worth plate of tacos.\n\nThe food is delivered cold, the margaritas are unnecessarily over-sweetened and lack any flavor.\n\nSummed up, if you don't mind over paying for less than mediocre food because you'd like to support local businesses then this is your kind of establishment."
2,"I've always suggested this place to friends and co-workers. I usually get takeout from here twice a week. Sometimes they don't have the order ready as soon as they state when you place it, but the most I have ever waited was an extra 10 minutes. The food has always been fresh and tasty.\n\nUntil today. I ordered the 2 roll lunch special and a dynamite roll. I started eating my Dynamite roll only to sudenly have excruciating pain in my mouth. Turns out there was a large piece of wire in one of the pieces!! I cut my tongue and jabbed a hole in my gums. Needless to say I will not be going back. It's one thing to have an 'off night' food wise... But there should never be an excuse for safety issues like this."
2,"The gourmet buffet wars are really heating up in Las Vegas... it seems every few weeks there is a buffet pushing the limits of gourmet in a self serve setting. And I couldn't be happier. However, I am sad to see that the Bayside Buffet at the Mandalay bay is starting to show it's age. The food isnt bad, the service is fine.... but the hotel and resort in general get you in the mindset of expecting that high end experience, and the buffet just doesn't deliver. I think we can expect to see this buffet be one of the next to undergo a major remodel and upgrade...if they don't...I don't see them keeping those tables full."
2,Love how friendly they are and the unique ome like design of the restaurant but the food and the coffee is not at all good tasting..also if you go through the drive through it takes them so LNG that they might ask you to just pul forward and wait till one of the employees brings out you  food - just not impressed at all mediocrity
2,While the amusement park contains amazing rides be prepared for hours of waiting in line for seconds of pleasure. We were there with 3 children. An exhausting day most of which spent waiting in line in the sun while the children Get more cranky. \nThere are ways to cut the lines with flash pass which to be honest make it frustrating for all those who need to wait. I teaches the wrong values to children.
2,Made the mistake of coming here for brunch Homecoming weekend. The service was incredibly slow. Took over an hour to get two breakfast dishes. I didn't get drinks but it did seem like people were enjoying their drinks orders. \n\nI ordered huevos rancheros with chorizo which is something I thought was hard to mess up. After the wait I was expecting greatness but this restaurant did not deliver. Eggs were over salted and the presentation was not appealing. Don't think I'll be back again.
2,"We tried The Spot for lunch, and it was just eh. At the end of the meal, it reminded me more of like a short-order restaurant.\n\nWe ordered the Spot sandwich (a plain chicken sandwich with mediocre quality bun), and a chicken salad. The best part of the salad was the little piece of apple cinnamon bread that came on the side. Otherwise, it was little more than salad with deli turkey/ham in it, and some walnuts. \n\nThe seating was uncomfortable, and there's only 2 tables inside downstairs, and 1-ish up the stairs. Not great for summer eating in AZ. We ended up outside. The misters helped a little, but it was disappointing that most of their seating is outdoors.\n\nThe dessert case looked pretty good, but not good enough to make me want to try it. \n\nI doubt we'll go back, it wasn't even compelling enough for me to write this review on the same day we went."
2,$3.79 for the small blizzard. Really??! \n\nI laughed when I saw the size as I picked it up through the drive-thru. I guess it's just been a long time since I've had a blizzard. \n\nDang! Guess I won't be getting one of those again for a while. (Which is probably a good thing.)
2,"Came here randomly just because I was in the area. Not really impressed with the food. The interior and the overall atmosphere of the restaurant is lively. I'd even say the place is pretty close to over decorating, but at least there's a lot to see. I was definitely mesmerized by their fish tank!! It had no real fish but a bunch of little ones that constantly floated around...geniusness!\n\nBack to the food. Ordered pad see ew with chicken. The portion was pretty small and it lacked noodles. There was plenty of broccoli though. The Thai BBQ chicken was ok. Nothing too special about it. As for the garlic chicken, I don't even know if we got the right order? Our waiter said it was, but I would have renamed it crispy/deep fried chicken with some sort of sweet chili sauce? Don't know what happened there, but at least that portion size was decent. \n\nService was slow too. Even asking for hot water with lemon took twenty min. Ehhh just not too impressed overall."
2,Just recently went to the Frank Caliendo show which was great!! We (two couples) got there early hoping to get good seats. Much to our surprise they told us to sit close we had to spend $$60.00 in booze or beer per couple to sit up close. That seems like they are promoting DUI's. That is a lot of alcohol!! Very disappointed in The Improve for this action. Our seats were ok and we had partial blocked views so the Improve is probably not for us anymore.\n\ncb
2,"Okay, so it is $1.50 per ticket at Tropicana Cinemas. But let me tell you, ya get what ya pay for. There are only I think 5 screens here and a small lobby with 80s and 90s vintage arcade games. It gets crowded in there when people have not yet gone to their theatre. Once inside the theatre you realize that the $1.50 price tag brings in the, um, inconsiderate element. People who spend the movie texting and arguing with security when told to stop. People who bring their screaming kids into a rated R  movie with excessive violence and salty language. People who do not know how to stay in their seats. I would almost rather pay the outrageous prices at other theatres if only for the more comfortable seats and fewer idiots."
2,"I've only used the conference room facilities at this location and I have to say it's not that impressive. The rooms are stuffy and humid, and it seems over all hard to properly control the temperature. \n\nCoffee that is being offered during conferences is pretty bad too. \n\nI can't say much about the hotel rooms."
2,After traveling all day I was looking forward to ordering carryout from paymons.  When I called in my order I was disappointed to find out they don't take any carryout orders after 9p
2,I had heard raves about this restaurant so brought 3 guests for dinner.  Food was just ok (the 22 oz  rib eye steak was 50% fat and bones and was undercooked; scallops just ok; frites and vegies barely warm).  Our waitress was very good which compensated a bit for the food.
2,"I've been here a few times. \n\nThe good:\n- Very strong drinks. Almost, if there is such a thing, too strong.\n- Our first order of cheese curds. Hot, gooey, greasy.\n- Cheese soup + chunky tomato soup = delicious bowl of soup.\n\nThe bad: \n- Slooow service.\n- Our second order of cheese curds. They were made with a different kind of cheese than the first (?) and were rather cold.\n\nI wonder what will change now that they're under new management."
2,Staff is not knowledgable and unapologetic. Please use better training procedures as I waited 20 minutes for them to figure out a printer situation (and even tried to help with mo knowledge of the product) and they were still unable to assist me. Thank you.
2,"I was excited to try this caf\u00e9 for the first time. The food was great, BUT it was very difficult to overlook the bad service and general disorganization.  Hostess continued to seat people at dirty and unset tables. Poorly managed - the servers where pretty vocal about not knowing which tables to deliver the food to. Delivering us another table's food. After about 30 minutes we received our breakfast order. All easy fixes if the restaurant is managed properly. There are too many options in town with great food & consistent and friendly service to return to this caf\u00e9.  I do not recommend this restaurant."
2,"Previous stay here was great about 3 years ago.  This time our room card key didn't work...had to replace them twice.  We found that housekeeping didn't shut our door completely when we returned from breakfast.  Unacceptable.  We were awaken 3/4 nights that we stayed by different guests every night talking so loudly in hall between 2-6 a.m.  Lady across hallway was not pleased either, so she opened her door and told them to keep it down.  One night someone tried jamming their card key in our door until my husband yelled for them to stop.  Won't stay at this hotel again."
2,"Puke.\nChicken Korma tasted like rubber ducky puka.  It was gravy, not a cream or cashew based sauce as it should be.  It was thick and disgusting.  I asked for all white meat and the waitress acted like that was a problem but agreed to it.  However, the chicken was undercooked and tasted old. \n\nThe chicken tikka masala tasted like tomato sauce that had gone bad.  \n\nThe rice was dry\n\nThe naan was burnt.  \n\nThe place looked like the Bates Motel--super grimy\n\nThe service was slow\n\nThe water tasted like fish\n\nNo one was there on a Friday night which made it even more creepy.\n\nYuck.  Would not return.  Too pricy for the poor quality and service."
2,"I had really high expectations for this park after reading all of the great reviews on Yelp.  I was very disappointed with this park.  There was trash, broken glass and graffiti everywhere.  I was more scared of stepping on a piece of glass than a snake jumping out at me."
2,"I love papa Johns. I have always had great customer service with the exception of this location. Got my order wrong, delivery girl basically threw the food at us and ran so we didn't realize until she was gone. When I called the girl who answered the phone was rude and put me on hold only to pick up and say she \""couldn't like do anything\"" put me on hold for the manager who also didn't know what to do (perhaps have the driver turn around?! Or even apologize perhaps?) . \n\nHopefully we will be able to order from a different store in the future or corporate will get a handle on this location. Pizza is really good and vegan friendly so I would hate to not order from papa Johns anymore."
2,"I used to like Yi, but as of today I will not be going back there ever again. I brought in an $800 bathing suit (it was a gift) to be tailored so that I could resell it. It was brand new with the tags still on, but just had some threads that were coming apart. \n\nI came back today to pick it up and the tags were completely gone. I explained to him (and a woman there behind the counter who spoke better English than he) that there were 2 tags on it; the regular tag with the barcode and one that held thread for the bathing suit. Both were MIA. \n\nInstead of saying \""I'm sorry\"" he blamed me and said I must have taken them off or lost them which is ridiculous. I was going to resell it on eBay, I didn't touch the tags and never would have taken them off. \n\nAnyway, I won't be going back. I'll be taking my business somewhere else.\n\nThe reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is because the tailoring was good, but losing my tags and then blaming me is unacceptable."
2,"I was really looking forward to a relaxing facial and massage. The people at the desk were nice and so were the massage and facial professionals. The massage and facial were average... \nFYI when asked if there is any area you want to focus on in your massage do not say a particular area. I've done it before without issue, but this particular therapist thought that gave her permission to do a pretty good job in the neck and shoulders and rush through the other areas. Seriously like one to two strokes and she was done. When she was done with her rushed one stroke hurried massage, she simply said we are done...No finishing relaxing transition (sorry I am a former massage therapist so I have a lot of expectations in a massage). \nThe facial was a similar experience. Happy with what the work she did, but she was young, hyper and wouldn't shut up. She moved fast through the facial with fast strokes like she was trying to wake me up rather than slower deep strokes that would have made it much more relaxing.\nAs a first time customer, I got a special, but I wouldn't ever pay regular price for a massage here. These guys are amateurs. As a courtesy didn't want to publicly announce therapists names, but message me and I'll share them with you so as to avoid these two young women."
2,"Delicious meal, terrific rice... really too bad we both had intestinal backlash when we returned home. Had to use pepto b. Ugh!"
2,"PROS: \nClean hotel and lobby, great customer service/staff, very personable and nice. \nFree breakfast buffet, wifi, gym, pool\nbeds were really comfortable and its all non smoking\nyou can feel it was really clean, unlike other older properties on the strip where your scared of whats on the bed. \n\nCONS:\nFar from the strip, and the places where its happening, you really have to drive and park in another central casino\ntheres nothing nearby so you cant walk down and go out or get something, besides the convention center and LVH. im not sure why you would walk to or go to the Riv.\ni feel like since it was new and trying to be modern, it had alot of cheap/ikea like ambiance and decorations, nothing glitzy or fancy. \n\nWould i personally stay here again? \nnope, id want to be on the strip, and be able to go down and do what i want and if i ever wanna go back to my room i have the freedom too. and also get that whole Vegas vibe."
2,This used to be the best coffee in Montreal. I believe the prior owner imported/roasted their own beans? Now it is Gimme Coffee from Ithaca NY. It was.. OK. I think I was grossly overcharge by the oriental barrista: $6 for a VERY small slice of pecan pie which should have been much less per the menu. My protests fell on deaf ears.
2,Typical rude salesmen working here.  Came in with my boyfriend looking to buy a car immediately since my car died and i was driving a rental.  Was supposed to meet with Luke who I had been corresponding with but he took a different appointment so we met with another salesman who was rude and right off the bat and seemed so disinterested in helping us find a car. Felt so uncomfortable with him from the beginning.  Work on your customer service skills please you just lost customers and money.
2,I am taking away a couple stars for overpriced appetizer chicken wings ($9) and jack and coke ($18) AND ambiance wreckers. Went out for their Saturday jazz event and was disappointed with the rowdiness of the crowd and appalling price points. This is the fourth time here for me and it's just not getting any better for me.
2,"\""Make something as generic as possible to appeal to as mass a crowd as we can\"" must have been the proprietor's business plan.\n\nThis place reminded me of the \""sports-bar-like\"" area inside of a Chili's, only overgrown into the entire establishment.\n\nAnnoying decor, staff,  and, yes, crowd too.  They had the same football game on every single TV in the house, even those screens right next to each other.  Nothing but stupid logic there.  They also used this football game as an excuse to postpone the start of the scheduled poker game that they'd agreed to host, but only because they wouldn't use one of the TVs to show the poker stat screen.  Whistle!\n\nPenalty!\n\nLame."
2,"Sadly I wanted to be impressed but I was not.  Being a vegan I actively search out restaurants that have a menu that is vegan friendly.  So today I had some time on my hand and headed to the heavily reviewed Red Velvet Cafe.  Disappointment was what I found.  The menu was a mixture of vegan, vegetarian, and non-veg, which is nice to see a restaurant trying to serve everyone but it is also its downfall.  Instead of innovating vegan or vegetarian dishes they seem to veganize they menu by removing the meat and replacing it with a vegan substitute.  Boring.... I ordered the flatbread with pesto and hummus, vegan style.  They replaced a parmesan cheese with a vegan cheese.  Yuck... It had no flavor.  Pesto should be distinguishable on whatever it is on and it was bland and looked like it was out of a jar.  It tasted like it too. The hummus was also bland and seemed heavily processed and not homemade.  The placed it on the pesto flat bread with a disher/ice cream scoop.  Seriously not an attractive presentation.  the only saving grace of the meal was the beverage.  I ordered the sangria sparkling tea.  Tasty and served with fruit floating it in.  Delish.  $5.50 a glass and no refills is a bit steep though.   Too bad...oh well I have my favorite vegan restaurant in Las Vegas and I am sticking with it."
2,I checked in on Tuesday for three nights. I was upgraded to a suite on the 7th floor but the suite was extremely warm due to the thermostat was to high. It took several hours to cool the living room down. Then that night I was awakened to a bulldozer backing up and listening to irritating beeping and construction at 4:00 am.\n\nI'm a light sleeper so I tossed and turned for several hours before finally gave in and went to the fitness center to work out.\n\nWhat really sucks is I requested a upgrade and requested a high floor in a previous e mail I received from a staff member a day before arrival. I advised her of what took place that Wednesday morning via e mail and never even got a reply - BOGUS!\n \nOn Wednesday afternoon I ended up relocating all my belongings  to the fifteenth floor where I couldn't hear any construction noise! \n\nManagement - Are you reading this? Is this how you treat your Premier Platinum Elite members.... WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT.
2,Here since Sunday at a conference.  \n\nFacilities are good. Beds not as comfortable as they should be. \n\nMaid service. Poor. Hyatt trying to save money?  How about refilling soap and other products. Beds poorly made. Do not like my feet touching the underlayment of sheets. \n\nStaff fair.  If you've ever been to a resort who's been through forbes training then you'd know the difference.  If they have been through the training they are not being held to a standard. \n\nBar service better. \n\nBut this imho is a management issue. Lack of standards and possible budget restrictions. \n\nNot inexpensive. I'd say it will pass for a conference facility but does not meet my standards for a destination vacation. \n\nI believe the experience outweighs the facility. If the service is outstanding you'll overlook facility to some degree. \n\nThis is not an experience location.
2,I gave them two stars bc the place is mediocre at best. The outback used to be one of our favorite places to eat however it has gone down hill. I could take it or leave it. My husband orders a half rack of ribs every single time we go. About a good 75% of the time he gets a skimpy half rack of ribs with about 5 fries. There portion sizes and quality have significantly declined. It's inconsistent and nothing great anymore.
2,"I have high expectations when my friends recommend a place.\n\nI popped in to Serendipity 3 recently with a good friend of mine who was in town. We didn't have time to meet up for dinner, so we thought this would be a good dessert spot.\n\nWe shared the Frozen Hot Chocolate. It was good, not great. Slightly watered down, but it did have that chocolatey overtone.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I've enjoyed a more full-flavored beverage at Starbucks or the Coffee Bean.\n\nThe environment seems very warm, friendly and inviting. The staff was very attentive. These were the only redeeming factors.\n\n\""Meh. I've experienced better.\"" BUT it wasn't the worst place in the world. \n\nJust being honest."
2,"Pretty dead location, inside, and outside. One girl at the register was okay, paying attention to customers, another girl filling the donut boxes looked like she's been whipped by sprinkles, and could care less."
2,"I know exactly how to spruce the old castle up...a controlled demolition.  Time to bring the old girl down and start over.  This place is rotted to the core.  The \""upgraded\"" rooms feature faded old plasma screens that pre date HDMI plugs and seem to display images in grey scale.  The carpets are a mosaic of stains, the buffet is a flesh eating bacteria breeding ground, and the live lounge entertainment is...is...well, I don't know what to make of them.\n\nThe price is right for the dump that it is.  That earns them an extra star.  If you stay here, plan on being out most of the time and it may work for you."
2,"There were some staff members that were very friendly and that is the only reason I didn't give this place 1 star. Other than that, the waffle was bland, the fried chicken was mediocre at best. They also didn't return my card with the bill which led me to forget it at the restaurant. When I returned to get my card, the cashier popped open the register and lifted up the cash drawer to find my card with about 15 other credit cards and said \""wow, a lot of people have left there cards here today!\""  ...Or...  Maybe there were a lot of people whose cards didn't get returned because your staff is all over the place.\n\nRoscoe's needs to come to Arizona and put a stop to these shenanigans."
2,Seriously? seriously?\n\ni find nothing appealing about this place. \n\nthemed restaurants are for the lamez of the world. they do have some bangin hot chicks working here. but nothing to get myself worked up about. next it will be McFarland's and it will become a lame comic themed bar. or worse. why do our local celebs blow?
2,(-) confusing entrance to the hotel\n(-) no casino\n(-) small deluxe suite \n(-) small pool area \n\n(+) it is near Aria & Cosmopolitan.\n\nI wouldn't stay here again.
2,"My previous review of Caesars was more fun but this one is more important. I now see my consumer experience (sleeping, eating, dancing, playing, etc.) at Caesars through a shadowy lens, knowing that the property's managers aided and abetted the unconstitutional search of a guest's room (i.e., while the guest was the *owner* of a leasehold property interest in the room): http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/01/opinion/deceptions-of-the-fbi.html"
2,"It's been several years since I've been here and I see the name has changed from blue sage to stone grill. Along with that change came a change to the breakfast buffet, and not for the better. The price is the same, but the selection has dropped dramatically. I was also disappointed with the service. The place was empty and we saw our server twice while we were there. Doubt I will go back again. It's a shame because it used to be so good."
2,"I was REALLY hungry, so I called in three rolls to go. When I got home with them, I found them to be so small that it made me angry. For $35, I got a tiny appetizer. I've never seen rolls made so small. I had to call and have a pizza sent to my room for dinner. I eat sushi all the time."
2,"A lot of mediocre food for a very reasonable price.  If you're really hungry, you can find some decent stuff there, like fresh shrimp, salt and pepper shrimp, mussels on the half shell and the grean beans were terrific.  The food line up was strange.  Ice cream, sushi and shrimp, desserts, salads and then entrees.  Overall, okay, for the price.  Was really hoping for something \""supreme\"" as they've been working hard to tranform an old buffet house into something special.  Won't be a regular, but won't say I won't go back either."
2,"I like the idea of this resturant, because soul food is a tradition in my family, especially during the holidays.  However the food here leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  I can see the potential here, but the whole operation is unprefessonial and rough around the edges.  \n\nI have eaten here more than a handful of times. \n\nOnce Big Mama's House of Soul were selling food at an out door festival. I waited in line for roughly 40 minutes only to be told that they had run out of food.  This is an example of the unperfessonalism.\n\nI also do not like that they don't sale individual bones of ribs.\n\nAnother hit and miss for Soul for in Pittsburgh."
2,"Planet Hollywood makes me LOL.\n\nWant to know why?\n-It used to be the Aladdin, and the remodel was done rather half-assedly, you can still see middle eastern/arabesque motifs all throughout the casino and mall.(Hell, the buffet is even still named the Spice Market. Sounds more like something you'd find in Morocco rather than Hollywood)\n-If MTV was a building you can go to, this would be it(more so than even The Palms and Hard Rock).\n-They're desperately trying to make you feel like you're in South Cali with Pink's Hot Dogs, a mall called the Miracle Mile, the EXTRA lounge(which is named after a celebrity news show which isn't much better than a tabloid), etc....\n\nIt tries so, so hard. And it fails. The Miracle Mile is definitely an improvement from what it was originally like so that's a plus. I still want to try the Spice Market Buffet but I've heard way too many stories about long toilet trips resulting from someone eating a Pink's hot dog and every other restaurant just seems overpriced or overhyped. Also, can't lie, but I do want to see Peepshow.\n\nDon't hate the place, but I'm definitely not a fan."
2,"I was really looking forward to this show. I took my Dad, who saw Nat King Cole at the Sands in '62, and then watched Dean and Sammy play craps in the casino. \n\nI opted for the GA seats, which is a row of chairs with no tables or servers. That didn't help. The smart way to run this would be to give EVERYONE a table or booth, with servers dressed in 60s costumes, and immerse the audience in the era. As it was, it was impossible to believe you were watching the Rat Pack. You were watching some credible imitators, sure, but you NEVER forgot that. I thought Dean and Frank were really good, Sammy was fair, and Joey, although occasionally funny, looked NOTHING like the real guy. Maybe people don't remember (or never heard of) him, but it was strikingly bad casting to me.\n\nI understand what others have said about the audience, but I think the Rio deserves more blame for the fact that the show never transcends the mundane. If we had been sitting in a booth drinking martinis instead of elbow to elbow with somebody, we might have enjoyed it a LOT more."
2,"I don't know his name but the guy taking to-go orders was so rude to my group and I. We were walking in and I went to get a boba tea and the guy was like, \""is this your party?\"" I was like, \""yes.\"" \n\n\""Are you sure? This whole party is yours?\"" \n\nI confirmed again. It seemed like it was an issue even though I told him we were getting to go. \n\nSo I told him what I wanted and he have me my amount so I take out my wallet and he's like, \""do you have cash? make sure you have cash.\""\n\nI looked at him like, \""I do?\""\n\nWhy would he say that as he gives me my total even though he there's no sign or anything? He said it really rude too.\n\nLuckily my boba was delicious or I'd burn this place to the ground. \n \nI doubt I'll be coming back. People at Volcano Tea are nicer."
2,"The music was great, but the crowd sucked.  It was about 11 p.m. and the club was dead.  Short cut line and our free drink cards promised a great start to a fabulous night, right?  WRONG.\n\nMy girls and I decided that we were going to get the party started by being the first ones on the dancefloor.  Too bad there were too many haters that would just walk by and give us dirty looks.  \n\nEww.  I'm sorry, but the last time I checked, wearing sunglasses in a dark club at night was just plain stupid.  Not my crowd.  I'd rather go to Pure."
2,Service was OK ... food was meh ... price was OMG! This place won't last long.  Started by ordering a Smithwicks (on all the menus) oh sorry we don't have that anymore. Good I really didn't want to pay $6 for a beer.  Had the honey mustard wings to start they where just so so the blue chesse dressing was nice and chunky that was a plus.  My hangover burger was nothing special I've had better burgers at Denny's.  Over all it was just a disappointment I don't think it will get a second chance.
2,"Terrible customer service. Took me 25 minutes to check out for one item, with only one person in front of me. That person had about six items or so. The person working as cashier moved as slow as humanly possible to scan, fold, and bag each item. It was truly ridiculous. My time is valuable. I don't have a half hour to give away for nonsense. I'd be reluctant to go back."
2,"Decent food, but when I eat at a restaurant in this price range, I expect exceptional. The scallop appetizer was perfect, but for being known as a 'steakhouse', both myself and my guest were extremely disappointed. I asked for medium rare, but was handed a steak with absolutely zero pink. Essentially it was like chewing dry rubber. The wedge salad I ordered seemed on par with one I'd eaten at a family chain restaurant (think Chili's or Red Robin). They did fill my drink to the brim of the glass, which was a plus. Overall, I'd rather go to one of the many other steak choices Vegas has to offer."
2,The only reason I gave it two stars was because the food was edible. Wasn't tasty and it wasn't horrible. Good customer service but it does not make up for the food.
2,"We stayed at the Palms for two nights on a Groupon special, it seemed like a great deal and it came with $100 of pool side food service; we had to be in Vegas for a wedding and this seemed like a great place to stay. \n\nUnfortunately, we were quite disappointed in the rooms and the service. The beds had visible concave dips in them. Thankfully there were two of them so my husband and I could sleep in our own dip independently. \n\nthe bathrooms were large yet not efficiently so. There is no fan in our bathroom (which seems odd) and the hardware for the toilet paper and the faucet was shoddy. \n\nNow I realize that most people go to Vegas to party and normally don't care about such things, but for the same price I can stay on the strip (which we did on our last night in Vegas) and have a very comfortable room. \n\nThe pool was nice and a fun thing to do during the week. the lifeguards and the pool service were friendly and attentive, although service was a little slow. \n\nThe casino gets awfully smoky, which is a bummer if you don't smoke and don't enjoy smelling like an ashtray. I was not impressed with the restaurant selections either. I think this place is fine if you are just there to party at the pool and at the clubs."
2,"Pretty standard bar food. I would not recommend it unless you were in the mood for simple fried or grilled food. Maybe a beer too if you're a middle-aged Packers fanatic. It's a cozy little old-American joint that honestly just reminds me of life in the suburbs, minus the gigantic portions."
2,"We went for Karaoke in the lounge, which is just past the 21 tables and across from the bar. Sun -Weds nites at 8 pm. A decent size seating area in front of a stage. There's piped in music overhead which kind of competes with the Karaoke singers. This Karaoke doesn't cut it with me, because, you have to get your song choice from a binder and write down song title/singer and catalogue number for the Karaoke dude. Then some idiot singers take a binder to their table and keep it there as if it's their personal binder. And lyric screen is a small screen in front of you.\n\nPlace is big time smokey. I couldn't believe people were actually staying there in their rooms. However, one thing I liked was a speaker in front on the sidewalk blasting the Karaoke singers singing !"
2,"WORTH THE PRICE, BUT NOT WORTH THE WAIT!\n\nDon't be fooled, the line outside the office at street level is NOT the real line. After you purchase your ticket, you proceed up the elevator to the line you don't see! Be ready for an hour wait. No restrooms or concessions up there. Suck it up!\n\nWe were there on a Sunday afternoon and the 15 second ride took us 3 hours! Just like going to six flags theme park. \n\nThe pictures they take of you while in flight are very un-flattering. High pressure to purchase them."
2,"I'm a big tiki culture fan. Walking in side I got stoked the place looks like a tiki bar. I approached the bar asked for my favorite tiki drink the \""painkiller\"" the bar keep didn't know what it was. I asked for a drink menu.  No drink menu. I asked if he could make a tiki drink. His reply was baffling \""we're a dive bar bro\"" ok. So basically it's a tiki bar that serves beer. Weird right.  If you have the theme why not make the drinks? Just saying."
2,"My husband and were drawn to Cucina de Vita while doing some shopping in Downtown Mesa. It definitely has curb appeal with the outdoor seating. The staff is quite friendly also. I Ordered the Meatball Parm sub and my husband ordered the Sausage and Peppers sub. The food came out quickly. First concern was when I tried the side order of pasta salad. It was served at room temperature. Same with the side of marinara sauce that I ordered. My husband's sandwich was good, he really enjoyed it. My sub however was  inedible as a sub. I had to eat the meatballs by themselves because the sauce was extremely bitter and over spiced with herbs. I will say that the meatballs tasted very good. If they can fix their food temps (safety issue) and their marinara this place will be a winner."
2,"Worst customer service ever!!! As much as I dislike Dairy Queen,  I think I'm going to have to go there from now on. Such a mood spoiler!!!"
2,"Well, they do sell beer. That's the only pro I can think of...\n\nOn the other side, they are extremely overpriced, very inconsistent with their hours of operation (and don't even have any posted hours), don't have a phone number listed if you want to find out when they are open, and they are really lacking in customer service and beer knowledge. \n\nSo, if you want craft beer and are willing to pay more than elsewhere, gamble on whether they are open or not, and already know beer well then this is the prime spot for you. You might as well try a hot dog while you're at it too!"
2,This place is small with an large patio area. They have some ok teriyaki white chicken(needs more sauce kind of dry) and terribly flavorless chicken fried rice. The service was quick and nice but I wouldn't recommend dining there as it seems to be heavy traffic for drunks and homeless people (unless people watching of sadness is your thing)so you would be best to pick up instead.\n\nI doubt I go back since the place is only so so at best for two of my favorite things. The crab puffs were nice though.
2,"This was my first time eating here. The food was very bland and uninspired. However, the drinks were very tasty. Our server was not the worst. But, definitely not the best. However, the manager was excellent. She came and asked how everything was. When I replied that it was just OK, she wanted details. The manager was very appreciative of my feedback and even took my fish tacos off of the check (something I did not expect). Also, they accidentally charged my card too much. The manager that I spoke to was very concerned and understanding. He even went to their accounting department to verify that their records only showed the correct charge. Although my first experience with the food was not great, I am considering giving them another shot thanks to the excellent managers."
2,"My son and I were their 1st customers of the day and the floors were nasty, with yogurt toppings under the tables that had obviously been there a while. In a place that serves food, cleanliness is everything. While the yogurt is OK, I will not be going back."
2,"Slightly better looking than most lobby bars.\n\nThe look is the only thing that's good about this bar.  It's located inside Luxor.  There are seats/couches around with attractive waitresses taking orders, or you can order from the bar.  The bar is also somewhat elevated so you can get a better view of the casino floor and people watch as well. \n\nWe sat down at one of the tables and ordered a few drinks but man.. they were super slow with the drinks.  The place was somewhat empty too since most people were heading towards clubs at the time.  While waiting I probably could've played 10 hands in black jack or something.\n\nPrices are your typical Vegas price.  $10-14 for a drink.  Typical drink selection with a few signatures.  Oh and they do have whipped cream since we ordered a BJ for a buddy of ours that was getting married haha.\n \nWith slow service, probably wouldn't come back here again."
2,"Service was pretty good, however they have Pepsi, boohoo! Salsa was tasty but the chips were stale. They ambiance was bright, colorful, nice patio...food was a 3 out of 5, however it's a Lil pricey for what you get. One beef taco with rice and beans is $11. Steak fajitas are $17. Would I try this place again? Eh probably not."
2,"My youngest daughter really enjoys cooking and is very good at it as well.  So when we got a flyer about this place and did a little research on it we thought it might be something she would enjoy.\n\nThey offer an \""advanced\"" class called senior chefs for teens with more experience.  Frankly, we expected more.  Much of the cooking was from prepared food, they weren't allowed to handle actual knives and it was overall just too remedial for older more experienced kids.\n\nBy the time kids are experienced enough to enroll in \""senior chef\"" classes they should be doing more actual cooking.\n\nOverall I liked the facility and the staff and it is probably a good thing for the elementary set, just not well suited for older kids that have some experience going in."
2,"We've been to Foodies Festivals before, but this was the first we'd been to at the EICC. Unfortunately, we went on Saturday, and it was beyond crowded and verging on dangerous. They should have allowed much more space between stands to reduce the crush, making grazing more pleasurable, and rendering it safe for pushchairs and wheelchairs. \n\nWhile there was little knew in terms of exhibitors, the quality was high and the samples good. The Extraordinary Sausage Company, in particular, was doing a roaring trade throughout the day, with some excellent produce; I recommend their sausages with Scotch Bonnet peppers. Unfortunately, the crowds they generated added to the crush. \n\nA good time, then, but disappointingly badly organised."
2,"Visited this past Friday for lunch because I love their honey hots wings. Service was prompt as usual but the wings were disappointing. The SIZE of the wings were minuscule- probably 1/2 their normal size-.. I mentioned it to the female manager who acknowledged that they were working with the supplier but she did nothing else...no comps, no discount etc....\nI find that unacceptable."
2,"Urban Outfitters is a Scenster's paradise with all the \""sorta 80\"" clothes one could want. Don't get me wrong, occasionally they have SOME neat stuff, but I dont want to pay 5x its value. They have a small men's section which seems to be the case with all stores. The Scottsdale Waterfront location is even worse. If you MUST go to one of them choose the mills Ave one."
2,"Voted \""Best Burger,\"" by the Phoenix Magazine, January 09 Dining Guide issue, Delux's Delux Burger was far from the best. The burger was nothing more than an under-seasoned and over-cooked beef patty confined in an oversized soggy baguette. \n\nThe burger is supposed to have been dressed with organic rocket, caramelized onions, applewood-smoked bacon and blue and gruyere cheeses. Should have had a lot of flavor, right? But it didn't. The only identifiable flavor was the sweetness of the caramelized onions. \n\nAlso, the roasted beet salad was overdressed and soggy. If it wasn't for the texture of the beets I wouldn't have known they were there.  The sweet and earthy flavor that I was hoping for was lost due to the overabundance of the salty blue cheese and sweet balsamic vinaigrette. \n\nDelux does have a couple things going for them: a pretty cool ambience, an extensive drink menu, and they serve up a refreshingly cold glass of H2o."
2,"Others have said great service.   Well, our experience was not so good.   2 hours 45 minutes later for an anniversary dinner.   First, seated quickly - but the waiter disappeared and came back with apologies.  Okay - having a good time.   Then the food - mushy crab cakes - better use lemon because the tartar sauce overwhelms the crab cake; calamari - breading crunchy but a bit much - same tartar sauce so lots of lemon is better.  Ribeye - for $60 not close to Capital Grille or even the old standby of Durants.   The manager was apologetic but it took us 10 minutes to get the bill - by that time - the restaurant was pretty empty.   \n\nNot even a close chance we will return after this experience"
2,"Over the course of two years I've stopped in here twice. Both times I find the coffee good, but the atmosphere uninviting.  At least four young guys are idling behind the counter. Neither a smile, nor a greeting for me on either visit. There are too many good coffee houses (Hava Java, for one) to waste time and money patronizing a place with arrogant servers."
2,"Initially, I will say that the ladies that cleaned my condo did a pretty good job and were pleasant as well.\n\nUnfortunately they were supposed to arrive between 8 and 8:30 AM and did not arrive until 9:50.  No call to let me know they'd be that late.  Calls to Planet Hugger always go to voicemail.  (After a number of tries, I've never been able to speak to a human by phone.)  The email I sent around 9:00 AM asking for an ETA so I could plan my day went unreturned.  I had to sit around and wait to let them in.\n\nFor someone like me who has a tight schedule to keep, this may not be the best option in town.  For the 80-110 minutes they were running late, I could have done most of it myself."
2,"I thought the show was mediocre especially for the price and for Vegas. The singer and the band were a half a beat slow on the songs, the dancers didn't seem to have much energy, they didn't play the complete songs, and the worst part was the show only lasted about 55 min. The performers seemed to just be going through the motions and not putting much heart into the music. The crowd was dead and nobody seemed to get into it. We saw another impersonator in San Diego, Kenny Wizz, who was excellent. He had all the MJ details and it seemed like it was as close to the real thing as we could get.  It was a full two hour concert and had the crowd up singing and dancing along. It was about the same price as this show.  Bottom line...we were disappointed and would not recommend it."
2,"Really? \nCame here with a big group. They do not take reservations and will not seat you until the entire party is present. \nThose of us that arrived early ended up grabbing a seat at the completely empty bar and ordering a drink. The bartender was cool. \nThis place is obviously very family oriented and when you call ahead the first thing they ask is if you will be needing a high chair or booster seat. That's great if you are trying to find a place to take the kids for dinner. \nWhen we were finally seated they delivered the best thing about this place...the rolls! These rolls are a carb filled dream and I hate that they kept bringing more, it just made me eat WAY too many. \nWe all ordered the Sirloin steak that was the special of the day. Mine was way over cooked and the sides were all lackluster. \nThe servers wear shirts saying that they lover their job and ours actually told us she hated hers. Thought that was funny! \nI will not be going back here again unless I have to and then I will have a cocktail and rolls for dinner... \nBring your kids here and I will gladly dine somewhere else."
2,I love this food but the service is really lacking..  we come here at least once a month but the service is rarely good much less great..  Hey owners do you not read what your customers say??  Help us love this place by stepping up the service...  dont you want to keep loyal customers??  Help us help you..  READ what the customers say and make a difference!!!
2,"Went here with an out of town friend because his wife was raving about the chopped salad she had years ago. After much hesitation on my part, I gave in since said he said he was paying (everyone has their price). My buddy was warned by the waiter that the $12 chopped salad was not meant as a meal (maybe it was years ago) and viola, a small chopped salad arrived. Needless to say, he left the restaurant hungry. \n\nI had their $30 sliced steak special served on a bed of corn and beans with a honey type sauce. I took a few bites, it tasted good but I started to ponder, where have I had this meal before? Oh yeah, Chipolte's steak burrito bowl sans the rice.\n\nIn summary, the food was good, the service was excellent but I've experienced better at a lower price point than Cowboy Ciao."
2,"I've used them a few times & like the promptness & the way the drivers help with bags. However, the parking lot isn't in good condition & if it's been raining, you'll likely have to walk through huge, deep puddles. \nBut the reason I won't be using them any longer is because today I showed up, parked, got on the shuttle only to see a sign taped on the window that said the rate would be increased to $6.45 a day through the holidays. I wouldn't have used them had I known this. And I think it was sneaky if them to not tell customers at the gate.\nPlus, they charge sales tax & the airport parking lots don't.\nI won't be back."
2,"I'm giving them a low rating just because they charged me & my friend to get in (this was at 1 am on a Sat night / Sun morning, so there wasn't anyone in line) even though their website says local ladies are always free. What part of always free do they not understand? If they're not gonna honor this statement, then they should remove it from their website.\nWe just ended up going somewhere else instead."
2,"You know the Ross commercials that go something like \""I got it at Ross...\""  I wish. I have not found a single thing of use at this store. \n\nI'm always greeted by a security guard (not always the most qualified-looking individuals...), and I feel like a criminal as I roam the sparse racks with a shopping cart with a vertical five foot pole attached. It's like I'm in kindergarden and the teacher needs to see my every move. \n\nEvery garment seems to be ill-fitting, polyester and/or flawed.  If I do find something, I feel like I need to wash it prior to wear.  \n\nSometimes you can find some decent odds and ends:  home wares, linens, socks, scarves, toys...yet, the search for them is time consuming and often disappointing. \n\nI prefer Target. Or TJ Maxx. Or if I'm feeling trendy, H&M."
2,"For a chain or restaurant in general with \""wing\"" in the name, this place really doesn't impress.\n\nIf all you're looking for is standard draft beers, mediocre wings and sports, sure it'll fit that bill but it won't stand in any discernable way.\n\nWings are just average sized. Selection of sauces is good, the hottest is pretty hot but not extremely flavorful. I suppose it's just there to burn you twice, you know what I'm talking about.\n\nI won't go on promoting a bunch of local bars or chains locally that do the same thing with wings, beer and sports. Oh okay, I will; Hazelwoods, Native New Yorker, Zipps and Tweakwoods all do some/everything better than Wild Wings."
2,The Room Smelled bad when we walked in. And even worse you could see Daylight through the door. there is a serious problem with a hotel when the curtains block the light better then the door does. the Breakfast bar food is pretty bad. Eat the fruit.\n\nthe only reason I gave it a second star was because the bed ws really comfy... of course I just got off a red eye flight and didn't sleep a wink so maybe I was seeing it through rose colored glasses.
2,"Overpriced. Dry pork. \nSpecials don't save much. \nTea is good.\nYou want some great BBQ, ribs, etc? Go to Hap's BBQ on Washington st. and 52nd st. Next to samurai Sam's."
2,"I was with one of my friends and he looked up Cuban Pete's menu and read that they had:\nCuban Pete's Cigars / Cigarros Cuban Pete 7.00\nTwo cannoli shells dipped in chocolate ganache and\nfilled with Gran Marnier whipped cream, served\nwith a scoop of vanilla ice cream and finished with\ncandied orange peels.  \nSo- we zip in there to check it out, it sounded delish!  They served us stale, refridgerator empty cannoli shells- with bagged whip cream, you could tell because it is shiny looking, they didn't even fill the shells, they just squirted it in the ends.  It was a disaster.  Where are my candied orange peels? \n\n I would completely write this restaurant off, but the Cuban sandwich on another reviewers pic, looks really good, so I am going to give it one more try, but I won't be ordering the cigars."
2,"I've been to this restaurant several times in the past and thought the food and the service was much better. This time it was a dismal experience on all fronts. It took 90 minutes to get a table of 7 fully served. Was really the worst experience I have had at any restaurant in a while. The food was okay and I've had better here in the past.\n\nSam, if you're listening, I think you've taken your eye off the fries brother. Stop opening so many places and focus on what made you great..Great experience, great food, great value. The Greene House needs to go back to the basics."
2,The staff here is competent but their practice of writing prescriptions as dispense as written for brand name drugs that a generic would work just fine is unacceptable and they won't just write on my chart that I prefer generics like most offices. I don't care if the coupon makes it the same price because the activations are such a pain.
2,"The food and service were great, but the music was so loud you couldn't talk without yelling, but it was a Saturday night, I can understand that. What really got to me though was the lanes were not properly waxed so you couldn't slide and it would seem the AC was broken. My friends and I kept going outside to cool down. Several of us asked for the AC to be turned down and we were told the AC was broken, which is horrible is Phoenix. Overall I'd go to party there, but as a bowling alley, I'd go somewhere else."
2,Food took a very long time to arrive and tasted like it was straight out of a can or jar.  Maybe they had trouble finding the can opener.  The colorful decor and low prices are the only things this place has going for it.
2,Fries were cold and the tomatoe slices were merely laid on top. I know this is airport food but plenty of fast food places make a better cheesesteak
2,Poor service and food was disappointing.  Plus the bathrooms are cleaner at mcdonalds. Seriously...it was disgusting. One (of the two) sinks was missing the handles. Classy.
2,"I didn't care for my hot dog, regular with sauerkraut but my husband liked his fried with bacon. The fries were good but overall 3 hot dogs, chili cheese fries and 1 soda was $30. Not worth it in my opinion."
2,"This place totally makes me think of the Black Hoof in Toronto, following the trend of in your face meat eating, where patrons eagerly munch on bone marrow as appetizers before settling on pig's head (yes literally pigs head) for the main course.\n\nYou have to be really hungry to eat here, and on a low fat diet to prepare yourself for the cholesterol shock that is about to hit your digestive system.\n\nI wanted to try something light, which is probably why the night didn't fare so well.  I followed ht the waiter's recommendation for an original \""salad\"": pan seared veal over potatoes and watercress.  The dish was immersed in olive oil to the point of being soupy, and topped with an egg.  There was very little in the way of greens, so I don't know how this was categorized as a salad.  Unsurprisingly, this was very, very heavy.   \n\nI give full points for creativity, since I've never quite had anything like it before, but can't say I enjoyed it and could only eat half before I felt overwhelmed by the grease. \n\nThe creme brulee and molten lava cakes were fine as desserts--but they are always a safe bet. \n\nIf you're looking for a meaty place, this is for you.  If you were hoping for a light meal go somewhere else."
2,"Interesting place. It's like recess for adults. Giant jenga, giant corn hole, giant beer pong, bean bags, board games.  Didn't try the food. The bathroom was super clean and nice, and the whole place had a really nice smell. But the bartenders suck, they were rude and only paid attention to a group of young women."
2,"Most boring club sandwich I've ever had the privilege to consume. It was constructed of cold cuts, and pieces of iceberg lettuce and bacon so small that it took some skill to keep them INSIDE the sandwich as I was eating it. The waiter's unkempt, rather greasy appearance made me wonder about the cleanliness of the food preparation. Next time I'll go to Fox Sports Grill."
2,If you're looking for a quality buffet this is not it! If you're looking for variety and quantity then this 1 might cut it. In my opinion this buffet is not worth $50? $30 max!
2,"They gave me  a cup to pour my own coffee out of those decanters where you pump the coffee using a lever on the top, like a cheesy hotel cafeteria.  Not very fresh, and a coffee was $2.50. \n\nThe \""Bold Ethiopian Night\"" coffee was not bold at all.  Watery.  It's too bad, I really wanted to like this place."
2,"The positives:\n\nThe upstairs patio is very nice and the misting ceiling fans certainly make being outdoors in the Summer a wonderful thing. Thats the only positive unfortunately.\n\nThe negatives:\n\nOver-priced, average food, noisy, and the layout of the restaurant is ridiculous. The servers and patrons are wandering everywhere bumping into each other and getting to the bathroom is impossible as all of the restaurant staff seem to be congregating and going back to the kitchen through this narrow passage? Weird? In addition, I have never been to a restaurant that forgot to charge us for an entree, then realized it after we had closed out our bill and came back and asked us to pay for it? We did not even realize they had not charged it since our bill was so expensive to begin with?\n\nI would steer clear of this place and try the number of quality restaurants with equal quality of service in this area. Hillstone, True Food, Seasons 52, Christophers, and the list goes on. This place just can't compete."
2,"I've had better experiences at OTHER T.G.I. Friday's.\n\nThe food is still the same like other locations.  \""Thank goodness.\""  BUT the service need to be worked on especially when there's only five tables to service and three servers are out on the floor.  The means something, which is called POOR SERVICE!\n\nI'm here with family and it's my cousin's 21st birthday.  It's not the best place for dinner but we want to make it something special for her.  The birthday celebrant's sister asked the waiter in advance to bring out  a birthday dessert for her so that we could sing her Happy Birthday but the server failed to remember and offer it.  We asked him three times and instead gave the brownie with ice cream dessert with no candles to the celebrant's brother.  We looked at him and said where's the birthday dessert.  The server replied, \""Oh I thought it was for him.\""  He instead brought out his cigarette lighter and told the lady celebrant \""here you can pretend to blow of the light with this.\""  HORRIBLE!!!"
2,Honestly if this review was based solely on the taste of the food it would probably get 5 starts but the service was sooooooo bad both times I was there. First of all they sat us at a dirty table and said they would have someone come clean it. Took 5 mins for someone to get there. Another 5 minutes for someone to take our drink orders. Now this is beyond me 5 minutes went by before my friends sprite hit the table and another 5 minutes for my coke. Why on earth they didnt come at the same time is beyond me and why it would 10 ten minutes pisses me off even more. We ordered a couple roles and some salads. The salads came and we ate them and then sat there and sat there for about 15 minutes before we could even get someones attention to say hey whats happened??  They must have known how shitty they were with out me even complaining becase when the rolls finally did come they told us the salads would be complimentary due to the lack of service. That is only reason they get 2 stars instead of one. Regardless after two shitty service experiences I have no interest in returning.
2,"Great concept but the execution is sorely lacking. The interface is fairly self-explanatory but the computer locked up several times while trying to upload photos from my phone. Several staff standing around and no one came by to assist. Just seems like there are some missed opportunities. We were close to the front door, and got up from the photo bar and headed out. Seems like the 2-3 staff chatting at the entrance might have noticed us in revenue-generating mode and said something besides \""thanks for coming in.\""\n\nAs a Mac user, it wasn't lost on me that the Microsoft logos were covered up with stickers. Cntl Alt Delete. We are outta here."
2,"Went for restaurant week. Had the brie to start. Sounded a lot better than it was. Barely warm brie, some dry apples on top, don't know what was carmelized about them, some fruit on the side and some toast. I saw nothing that was bruleed. Dinner partner had the Escargot, which was good. Second course was petite filet mignon. Petite is right! I should have paid better attention to that word. I was pretty surprised at how little it was. It came with decent sauce, three warm tomato slices and maybe 5 small pieces of potato wedge. I've had better steak fries. Disappointed. Dinner partner had the sea bass, nice flavor but also tiny portion!! Other dinner partner had the pasta. That was good and thank goodness he let me have some or I would have stopped at Culver's on the way home. Their fries are better than what I got by the way. Last course was Hazelnut Tarte. Pretty boring chocolate in boring non-flakey pastry with a few pieces of nut on top. Not impressed. Had called previously to see if their portions were smaller for restaurant week. They told me I wouldn't go away hungry. Wrong. Service was lackluster, had to wait quite a while between courses, had to ask for drinks to be refilled.  I'm sad that I wasted one of my restaurant week picks here. Won't be back."
2,"If you're planning on paying for a buffet on the Strip, allow me to convince you otherwise, because it is definitely not worth it. However, if you find yourself with some complementary buffet vouchers, let the Wycliff flow! Most of the food here is standard buffet, which is to say, bad, but there are some palatable items to be had if you look carefully enough. I went with the gyros, available near the salad bar. Also acceptable-looking were the salads themselves. For dessert, I hunkered down for some frozen instant pudding (or gelato, as they call it around these parts), which tasted good enough. As an aside, I noticed a lot of people putting their faith in the raw bar here, and I haven't heard news of a salmonella outbreak, so that's something. Sparkling wine is complementary, so drink up!"
2,"The only good thing about my appointment here was the O.D. was really nice.  Dr. Potter was very friendly and personable, he even took the time out to recheck my eyes after I mentioned a previous doctor had some trouble diagnosing my prescription - he wanted to make sure I was comfortable with the strength of the Rx and not have to come back.  \n\nEven though the doctor was nice, the rest of the appointment was just what you'd expect from a place like this: a long wait, a ton of people, and very little customer service.  I waited 20 minutes past my appointment time to be seen.  After my exam I went to the front desk to pay and get my prescription and was told I had to wait because there was someone else ahead of me.  The only other person that had already been seen was walking around trying out frames  (all I needed was the Rx since I wasn't getting glasses or contacts), so I had to wait another 15 to 20 minutes just to check out and get my prescription.  Ridiculous."
2,"This was a bit overkill for me. I went with a bunch of pharmacy friends because they suggested this for a night out. I had been to other buffets in Vegas and I heard this was one of the best.\n\nI wasn't overly impressed.\n\nIt was insanely expensive. I was expecting around $25 per person. My husband and I paid $90 to get in in the evening.\n\nThe food, while the ingredients were unique like wild boar sloppy joes and truffle potatoes, I didn't find that they tasted any better than other buffets I was at. It's like they traded weird ingredients for taste.\n\nMaybe this place was just too fancy for me. I wasn't impressed."
2,"The restaurant decor is really cute. But that's it. The service didn't terribly suck, it was just typical. I ordered the fruity tutti drink, it was really good. To eat? I ordered the chili cheese dog, because i mean how could you mess up a chili cheese dog. The bun was very hard. Disappointed. I tried my friend's burger, it was ok... not the best. The food here is quite expensive though."
2,"We ate here because the arranger for a family reunion picked it.  It is a typical upscale American restaurant. Very underspiced for my taste, which runs to Indian, Chinese, Thai and Middle Eastern. \n\nI had baby back ribs. The ribs were high quality but the sauce was not spicy.  Pouring a lot of Tobasco sauce on it helped only somewhat.\n\nMy broccoli had no spices whatsoever, altho it is was overcooked as in most American restaurants. \n\nMy wife would give her BBQ salmon two stars.\n\nAmerican cuisine seems to be flavored primarily with salt, fat and sugar."
2,"After reading all the raves about the green chili mac & cheese it was a must have - and then immediate regret. The green chilies were chewy and not peeled properly and the cheese in the mac was grainy and gritty. Yuck. Mac & cheese is by definition...cheesy and smooth. Not this. Horrible. The good side was the pulled pork sandwich and the hot BBQ was pretty darn good. All in all when I want good BBQ my choice would be Honey Bears first. But if I'm hard up and just gotta have some BBQ, I would consider Andrew's again."
2,"We ordered the Mochiko bowl and Srirachi Bowl. We liked it, kids finished their bowl, the only thing is that I wish they didn't use frozen vegetable. 2 stars for the frozen veggies. The food is actually very tasty!"
2,"We bought a Groupon to this place so we decided to try it out. \n\nThe food was average at best. They should take Lagasses name off the sign because it brings with it certain expectations that are not fulfilled. \n\nWe got the mini chili cheese dogs and the hamburger. The burger was a frozen patty just thrown on the grill. Flat, burned and cookie cutter shape. We didn't even finish it. \n\nGood price on drinks though!\n\nWe will not be returning."
2,"This review is based on only one visit, but I don't think we'll try it again.  I think the biggest issue was the service.  We waited quite a while before a waitress even arrived to fill our water glasses.  She made a couple of other brief stops later, but that was it.  Not especially friendly and not too concerned about our party of two.  \n\nThe food was ok.  I had the house salad and the pork tenderloin.  It was super salty.  My dining companion had the Caesar salad and the fettuccine alfredo.  He was pretty happy with his entree.  They do have a good assortment of beers and quite a few wines by the glass.\n\nThe decor is pretty nice.  Everything is very polished in a Cheesecake Factory/PF Chang's kind of way.  The place is also quite large, so I doubt there is ever a terrible wait.  I do like that they use Open Table for reservations."
2,"Six of us tried to go there for happy hour last night.  Of course, you can only take advantage of that menu and pricing in the bar/lounge area.  However, there are only 3-4 tables and a quarter circle bar, and it was packed (5:15 p.m. on a Thursday).  The rest of the dining room and the patio outside were EMPTY.  We asked if we could get the happy hour menu and pricing if we sat out on the patio.  The answer was \""no\"", even from the manager.  We ended up walking out and going to a more accomodating place down the street.  As we left, there were several other couples leaving for the same reason.    NOTE TO EDDIES - either expand the bar/lounge area, allow happy hour outside, or suffer the continued loss of business to other area places that are more accomodating."
2,"Not a huge fan. Food isn't bad but service isn't great. They posted a Sunday special and when I called to order it, it was a big long process that it shouldn't have been. Didn't appreciate the lack of customer service and the pizza was only mediocre. I ate in the restaurant once and also had bad service so I'm not impressed."
2,"Had a gift card and finally got down to Town Center to use it. Ordered garlic parm chicken pizza and a spinach artichoke dip with white pita bread. Bill came to 27 dollars and change. They told me to the food would be ready at 5, I had ordered around 4:45 pm. I got there at 5:10 because I parked in the wrong lot. The pizza was in the oven ready. I couldnt believe it when he pulled it out. It was a bar pie - I was expecting something a bit larger. He brought the spinach dip over and put both in a bag and said I had to wait on the bread. A full ten minuted later he brought the bread over - he should have at least left the pizza in the pizza warmer  while I wait, at least it would have been warm when I got home. The pizza was nothing special - it was ok , the spinach dip was excellent and the pita (the only thing that actually was still warm when I got home) was good as well. I didn't like the price, I expected leftovers for $27 I made quick work of the pizza ,dip and bread and was still a little hungry."
2,"my wife and i ate here for lunch after reading so many positive reviews.  we are veterans of the vegas buffet scene.  so i was surprised when the quality of the food was very poor considering this is the wynn.  probably one of the most prestigious resorts on the strip.  service was very good. unfortunately the food was not.  we will return to the resort, but will skip the lunch buffet"
2,"Every time I fly into this airport, I dislike it more. Of all the places to connect, you think this would be the one of the nicest...it most certainly isn't. It's always crowded and filled with hung-over-hipsters. All the food I've had is awful and this place feels like purgatory. Avoid it if you can."
2,"I'm astonished that Bell Cleaners has survived the recent Recession let alone the last 30 years. The pickup and drop-off experience, which they tout in the About narrative on their web site, is non-existent, and was only memorable due to incompetence. \nToday I waited 15 minutes, in the dark, while the only attendant on site searched aimlessly for my order, stopping five times to check her incoming text messages no less. Once she finally located my 11 shirts and 2 pair of khakis, she offered no apology or explanation and simply stuck her hand out, in silence, in what I deduced was a request for payment. What's worse is that they wanted nearly $15 for two pair of basic khakis. When I asked about the high price the attendant looked downward and mouthed something incoherent, again sticking her hand out. \nI will say that $22.55 for 11 shirts is reasonable, but not so great a deal that I won't go elsewhere. If you have money (and time) to burn on martinizing, be my guest."
2,"Overpriced is my first thought. Overall our food was good and service was friendly and all but I wasn't going \""wow\"" because of the price. I don't mind paying for large portions or something super good but $7.50 for a couple pancakes is too much for my retired wallet."
2,"Not a fan. The burger was greasy and the meat, flavorless. I opted for the Arizona, so the only saving grace were the semi-spicy toppings. The staff definitely doesn't look like they enjoy being there and as another yelper said, the decor reminds me more of a carwash than a burger joint. For the price it costs to go there I'd definitely recommend taking your money and driving to the In-n-out nearby. Heck for a few dollars more you can head over to Four Peaks and have a REALLY good burger."
2,I came here for a wedding reception. The party was small (25-30 people).  They sat us way in the back which was fine until I saw the biggest cockroach I've ever seen. The manager barely offered an apology.
2,"The food is good if you like very hot and spicy.  The two of us enjoyed a shrimp appetizer, goat meat, and jerk chicken.  The sides were also tasty.  The cleanliness and atmosphere were just so-so.  They must have a problem with people not tipping since there are several signs requesting patrons to remember their servers. (It does kind of look like a fast food place).  We were surprised when we received our $29 food bill to see that $7 was automatically added for tip.  Our service was good but I was glad I noticed the generous tip was already added on to the bill.  Not sure if we could have asked to have it removed, but we did not try. There are so many places in the area that are so much cleaner and better.  We wanted to try it, but will probably not be back."
2,"I wanted to book a breakfast for a wedding shower and tried to call this place 3 times. I was told that a manager would call me back the next business day on each occasion, but never received a call. It would have been a pretty large group and well worth their while but gotta say that I doubt I would even go here for a meal. Even if they could not have accomodated a group or taken a reservation someone should have followed up with a call or told me so."
2,"Where do I begin? If the food is from Chris Bianco you know it's going to be good,  but was tad dissapointed at our antipasto plate. It was rather ordinary and sparse compared to any of the dozen or so times I've had it at Bianco downtown. We also ordered the Rosa which is one of their signature pizza pies with cheese, onion and Arizona pistachios. Delicious. We also thought wine would be a nice choice. Unfortunately, they don't have their liquor license sorted out yet. So a hit and a two misses. \n\nBut here's the main reason they only got two stars: \n\nWe ordered the antipasto plate and when we asked the blonde female waitstaff person who brought it for bread she said they didn't have any. OK, uh, what? Seems that Pane Bianco (White Bread in Italian) doesn't make bread on Saturday's. I said, well, since they make pizza, perhaps you can throw some dough into the oven and bake some. She said they couldn't do that. What? In the meantime our resourceful waiter overheard the conversation and brought us some...wait for it...BREAD. She just looked vacantly at the newly arrived substance and walked away. Word to Mr. Bianco: Please fire her."
2,"Good yogurt and toppings.  I would give that a 4 star.  Management:  1 star:  Not customer friendly.  You have to be careful here to check the weight of your purchase.  We were charged $17.00 for two small cups of yogurt.  (The week before we had been charged $6.00 for nearly the same amount).  We went back the next day to see the manager.  The friendly cashier said that sometimes the scale doesn't reset.  Apparently that happened to us.  The cashier couldn't do anything for us, so we waited for the manager.  The manager gave us a hassle about our request, insisting that the scale was correct and that we had each ordered a pound of yogurt! (I showed her our past Visa receipts for $6.00 or $5.00, but she brushed them off).  She is definitely not customer friendly.  Finally after a tense ten-minute discussion she unhappily agreed to a gift card that didn't cover our loss.  We have been in the store since, but we are very careful to check the weight."
2,It was all hype!  As with most African American owned restaurants overpriced and short on substance.  The fried okra had great flavor but was undercooked and left it greasy.  The fries were horrible soggy and greasy!  The fish had good seasoning but was very chewy almost like fish jerky!  And the Seafood Gumbo was good but I'm still searching for some seafood!   PLEASE GIVE YOUR CUSTOMERS WHAT THEY ARE WILLING TO PAY FOR!  I will be trying your competitor Mamas Boy Cafe next time.  I'm a native Las Vegan looking for consistency in southern cuisine.
2,"I was taken to toast for my birthday. It definitely put a damper on my evening. Our waiter was miserable. When he came back with our drinks he  accidentally spilt  our beer all over my table and dress. I understand accidents can happen, but then he just left me to deal with the mess. I've never had that happen before, even in casual restaurants.  We had to use our dinner napkins to soak up the mess on the table and ended up eating off them. In retrospect we should have just left then, but since it was my birthday we decided to stay and give it a try.\n\nUnfortunately the food was very disappointing. My boyfriend's sweet and sour tofu, was literally a single massive block of tofu in broth. All I felt was pity watching him try to eat the bland tofu cube as I sat there in my stained birthday dress.  My vegetarian burger was a tasteless mass of pureed lentils between two buns. We left early - disappointed and depressed. Watching my boyfriend actually have to pay for the experience of having my dress ruined, their abysmal service, and bad food was painful. It kind of ruined my birthday night. \n\nI guess it guess it goes without saying I won't be eating there again."
2,"Just like the others this place is terribly hit or miss. I went twice, got a decent cut the first time from a nice and almost too cool for that kind of place woman and a horrible haircut another time. The woman who cut my hair the second time must have forged her license, she split my hair down the middle and cut everything the same length before I had a chance to say anything; she gave me the worst, most blunt and unflattering haircut I've ever been given. \n\nI have also seen that same haircutist (because stylist she certainly isn't) butcher a poor little boy with a botched crew cut, I didn't think it to be possible."
2,"If this is what paradise is like, I think I'll stick with normal life.\n\nThe Paradise Buffet at the Flamingo Casino and Hotel is one of the most sorry excuses for a buffet and the second-worst buffet I have eaten at in Las Vegas.\n\nThe buffet is hard to find, hard to get to, the selection is limited and the food just isn't good. While most buffets in Vegas pride themselves on seafood, the Paradise Buffet had very little of it.  \n\nThe center portion of the buffet is dedicated to shrimp cocktail and crab legs, but unlike the Aria Buffet or other top venues, the crab legs are not cracked open. This buffet also has some sushi, but it is dry and had been sitting out for a while. The sushi selection was also very limited and was the worst I have had in Las Vegas.\n\nThe rest of the buffet was nothing more than home cooked items like pot roast, macaroni and cheese, Caesar salad and boneless chicken. It was almost like an expensive, glorified Old Country Buffet. But at least with OCB, you didn't have to pay like $20.\n\nOf course, if you check-in on Foursquare you can save a few bucks on the buffet. But it is Vegas, and who wants to stand in line to save money on a buffet. Just put that five bucks into the machine instead and let it ride.\n\nBest bet: Skip this buffet and visit the Flamingo to just see the flamingos outside."
2,"Food is decent but service is horrible at the St Rose/Eastern store. They don't listen to any of your requests. Then when we asked to have it fixed, they told us we needed to ask for it when we ordered, which we did. Just not worth the hassle. Go somewhere else."
2,"I've been here twice and had very different experiences.  When I went for breakfast it was very tasty and no complaints.  The second time we went for lunch.  Three of ordered burgers with different cheeses, buns, etc.  All three burgers came to the table with the wrong combinations.  And we had asked for them to be cooked medium and they were definitely medium rare.  When they came to the table we pointed out the mistakes and the waiter took the plates away without really saying anything, no apology, no promise to hurry the new food.\n\nIt took a long time to get our new food and there was no comunication fromt he wait staff.  The new burgers finally came and they were very dry, cleary had just be switched to make them the right orders, but not a brand new burger.  No discount was taken off the bill or anything to compensate for their mistakes.  Will not be going back here."
2,"In retrospect, I wish we'd just bought a few cans in the shop and drank them on the train.\n\nIt was full of wasted folk who I suspect weren't waiting on trains, was reasonably dingy, and was just generally the kind of place where you drink up quickly because you just want to get away from the clientele."
2,"Great location! Pretty busy on a Saturday night probably because of the asu game. They changed things since the last time I was here about 4 months ago. Now they give you these \""name cards\"" where u write your name and just give it to the cooks. Guess I don't mind that much I got food much faster that way. I was pretty excited about making my shrimp bowl till I read the sign they just added stating that they are currently going thru a Shrimp shortage at the moment. You don't even get to sample the sauces any longer. That was another cool thing I loved about this place. WTF I was truly disappointed. Also I felt a little rushed. Not even ten minutes after I received my food the waitress handed me the bill. Not as pleased this time but I guess I'll give then another shot. Hopefully next time they'll have shrimp!"
2,"Coming in from out of state and I was craving good ol' tonkotsu ramen.  Found this place on yelp.  I am going to try to be as constructive as possible.  So here goes it: I ordered a tonkotsu ramen and it did not hit the spot. Their broth needs flavor other than just salty. Where was the pork flavor?  The charsui pork needs to be simmered more to make it tender. Perhaps they can use some mushrooms, non-intrusive veggies and aromatics to wake up the flavor to make it a true charsui. Also work on a finishing sauce to add to the bowls of ramen shortly before serving. There's a good market out there for them.  I hope they can significantly improve on their products. Republic - that word sets high expectations."
2,"Overpriced food.  The dishes were cooked sloppy and wine was not impressive.  We had 2 different Pinot Noir by glass and they weren't all that.  The bread basket was dry.  The Dior sign across the restaurant is a total eye soar and ruins ambience.  I would not go here again.  Spend your money somewhere else and save the drama of the wait.  Our waitress was very nice.  They did special order a vegetarian primavera for me but papardelle was stuck together and it was too,salty"
2,"I wanted to like it but I've had better. The people were as nice as can be, and very clean, but the service wasn't the best. Small selection of colors both regular and gel. My pedi was ok, but I can notice that she missed some top coat. My gel mani is very very thick, too thick. Also, she cut me pretty bad and I didn't really notice how bad til I have this big ugly scab. She knew she cut me and I didn't see any blood, I felt stinging and she put some of that green stuff on it and said it was t help moisten and nourish my skin, not disinfect cuz she cut me. Oh well, you win some you lose some. My eyebrow wax was adequate, but she didn't trim them only wax."
2,"Walmart just runs a gong show everyday. The aisles are always blocked and all the workers are always in a bad mood, I don't blame them though I would be too if I was treated as poorly as they are. Walmart is good for if you need something when your drunk at like 3 in the morning and everything else is closed."
2,"We ate here last night.  The food is not good and they are understaffed.  Sonoma is consistent with the other restaurants from this group, Nola, Seviche.  I will go back for drinks.  The wine list is extensive but the food is poor. \n\nGet a glass of wine and eat soemwhere else."
2,"Mediocre food.  Absurd wait times.  Cilantro in every pore of the meal.  REALLY REALLY LOUD.\nCabo, I'm just not that into you."
2,Boooooo! Our very nice owner sold her bomb Indian/Pakistani restaurant (was great for lunch buffet)! New management means no more lunch buffet and steeper prices. Definitely not-so worth your time or money! \n\nThey kept the same name so do not be fooled!
2,"We tried this the other night and had high hopes since we live very close by.  First, the beer selection is great.  They still didn't have anything on draft but a good bottle selection.  By good I don't mean just big with all the usual suspects but some very well thought out items.  I had a Three Philosophers and my wife had a cider.  \n\nService was SLOW...real slow.  It was almost 10 minutes to get our drink order in.  They were reasonably busy but not too busy.  The food was OK.  Not bad.  Not great.  I could tell my vegetables were frozen, not fresh.  I had to ask for my salad after my meal had already come.  Service was slow through the meal...ask for ketchup...wait until the waiter saw us and remembered...etc.\n\nWe plan to give them some more time and go back and I'll revise my review then.  But for now it was a solid 2 star."
2,"Great customer service!\nNow for the bad:\nHorrible water quality. My tea would have been yummy if not for the nasty water. Had to drink a cola so the water quality was better masked. \nFood was Meh. Seafood was not very good. Hushpuppies was yummy, onion rings horrible. \nSalad bar was very limited. Everything was fresh, but reminded me of a middle school salad bar.\n\nWish it was better. \nFelt very down home and welcoming"
2,"I wasn't blown away by the pulled pork, probably because it was cold when it came out. The fried okra was piping hot, though. On the plus side, the vinegar sauce was tasty and Bud the bartender was super nice."
2,"Bonne carte de vins et cocktails, mais tr\u00e8s dispendieux pour le type de repas. On m'a servi des crevettes nordique dans une sauce tomat\u00e9e, mais sans mentionner qu'elles \u00e9taient compl\u00e8tes(queue et t\u00eate). Tr\u00e8s difficile \u00e0 manger, car le plat est servi chaud. L'assiette de caille \u00e9tait bonne, mais petite pour le prix. Apr\u00e8s une facture de 80$ avec trois verres de vins, nous avons du aller manger ailleurs pour combler notre app\u00e9tit. Bref, pour un verre \u00e7a vaut la peine, mais pas pour souper."
2,"I was excited about this place after doing a search for \""best chimichanga in Phoenix\"" on Google, but it didn't live up to my expectations.\n\nI ordered the carne asada chimi but part of me wonders if that's what I got.  I couldn't taste much of the spices, especially the cumin.  There were also some sauteed onions inside so part of me wonders if I got the fajita chimi on accident.  There just wasn't much taste to the meat which made the chimi average overall.\n\nThe rice looked fine, but it had a burnt taste to it.  Maybe something happened with the broth?  I love beans smothered in cheese but there just wasn't much taste to either of them.  After a few minutes on the plate it hardened up and needed to be cut into sections by a fork.\n\nA couple of bright spots....  The salsa is good, both the regular and the hot.  They bring you a massive bowl of chips to snack on.  The waiter, I can't remember his name, was friendly and outgoing.  Also, I tend to like to overall feel of these kinds of places.  Not too fancy and looks old school.\n\nOne last thing....  I went there on a Saturday mid-afternoon and the bar section was completely hopping.  I'm not sure what that was about but my guess is that if you're looking for a place to put back a few on a Saturday then try Tee Pee.  I just can't recommend the food."
2,Omgoodness 20 min wait in drive-thru and no apology! And then they got my sons drink wrong. I would have gone in if we hadn't had the baby w/ us.
2,"Good location ,good food and wonderful ambience,slightly pricey as have just moved back from the states bagels are less than half price."
2,"I really should know better by now... If it's not a dedicated sushi restaurant.. Don't order sushi!! It's like ordering fish at a burger place!\n\nSushi looked amazing but the rice on their rolls was a bit hard.  Needless to say I didn't finish the meal otherwise I would have hurled!\n\nI also had their pot stickers which again I did not enjoy.  Sad to say but lean Cuisines have better potstickers!\n\nLastly but not least, their brownie desert was ... Meh.\n\nPerhaps had I ordered a different entree I would have had a better experience."
2,i spent nearly 13 dollars on a teeny tiny wimpy shrimp cocktail. the drinks in the lounge were over priced and the bartender had an attitude. the decor is from the 70's and unappealing. i dont see what all the hype is about.
2,"I'm a fan of fast-casual restaurants that offer healthy and fresh options. I don't always have time to cook at home and I don't have the deep pockets to constantly eat at higher end spots. So, there's plenty to like here. They specialize in fish cooked to order with your choice of seasoning or sauce and a side. Soups, sandwiches, salads, and tacos are on the menu as well. And, the place is kid friendly. They've got a few options for the rugrats, too. \n\nThe downside, at least from my singular experience, was that I could smell the fish coming to my table. It wasn't awful, but it was certainly the smell of a not-so-fresh fish. It was still edible and I liked the mango salsa on top of my orange roughy ($12) and had no qualms with the brown rice. But the fish itself could have been better. Obviously, at these prices you can't expect fish to be flown in daily. You'd have to go to Bartolotta or other high-end Strip restaurant for that.\n\nThe kid's chicken tenders ($5) appeared to be house-made, so they should get some credit for that. Unfortunately, it was too bland, even for my kid. \n\nConceptually, this place is great. But their execution and quality of product might be in question."
2,"Be prepared to feel like you are going blind if you come before the sun sets. Walking into Frankie's Tiki Room, it took 10 minutes before I could regain my vision, because it is so dimly lit. I have come to terms that part of the appeal in a dive bar is the lack of sight. Maybe it is to prevent you from freaking out if you knew what you are sitting or standing in. \n\nThe drinks come with skull ratings that range from candy to could be used to sanitize. Being accosted with \""Start with a five skull or I will just order for you\"" is unnerving. Katrina M. ordered me the green gasser and it was potent. If I said that the pour was generous, it would be a gross understatement. At first, it was not consumable, but it started to taste better as the ice melted. \n\nThe service is somewhat slow. I know my friends were waiting a while every time they went up. Even when it was starting to clear out. That put a damper on the hanging out because it felt like someone was always being left out."
2,"A dive bar that features Chinese food? Now those aren't two things you hear in the same sentence!  After trying this place I know why! \n\nMy buddy and I stopped at Chop and Wok on the way to the airport  and ordered the food to go. The NFC championship game was on in the bar and patio area, so this review is a bit late.  \n\nWe both got the same thing, a chicken and veggie combo on brown rice.\nI barely had time to eat a couple of bites as we rushed to return the rental car. 2 bites was 2 too many.  My navigator on the other had time for a bit more. Sad part is the chicken tasted like it was still frozen.  If you have ever microwaved one of those prefabbed frozen dinners, that is the level of flavor this dish had, bummer. \n\nHad high hopes for this place but all I can say is yuck! I hate to give it 2 stars but that was some bad Chinese food."
2,"I have been to this Bashas' a few times.. Two of the times we swore we would never go back. Once was when the manager was talking trash about an employee to the bagger that was right in front of us. The ENTIRE time we were checking out. He was so rude. The other time was when two employees were going on and on about their sex lives as they were checking us out. Pretty unprofessional if you ask me. The prices aren't too competitive, although I liked the Bashas in North Phoenix a lot when I lived there. It was worth the extra few dollars. But this one definitely is not. I would prefer Fresh and Easy, which is right across the street."
2,Okay so I see tons of positive review....time to bring into reality...I am from oregon where there is a lot of good authentic asian food...including pho. We got the pho-nomenal soup bowl...dissappointing...asked for chilli oil..and they didn't have it and said sirachi sauce is all you need. Really? Even the shrimp rolls weren't tasty. Think quality though the price matches other pho places I being too. Please re-think and makes some changes. I will be 3 months to see if anything has changed. I hope you are reading this. The two stars are for great customer service...that is the only thing going good for you.
2,"The place is very dark and divey.  The booth we sat in had torn upholstery.  The pool tables looked nice and the place had a good crowd at the bar just after 11am (that were discussing David Limbaugh's new book ??? ) plus a family at a table.  This wouldn't be my first choice for a family lunch but it isn't inappropriate.\n\nMy friend had the bacon burger with waffle fries and the Asian slaw.  I had the grilled chicken sandwich with waffle fries.    We were surprised to see that the waffle fries were sweet potato but they were crispy and tasty.  My friend liked his burger, but they forgot to put the bacon on and brought it out in bowl, the bacon was obviously overcooked and hard.  The chicken sandwich was well cooked but had a slightly overpowering grill flavor and could have used some kind of sauce.  My friend enjoyed the slaw. My Left Hand Lager was good.\n\nThis doesn't sound too bad so why two starts?  The servers were both friendly but inattentive.  I sat with an empty glass for a long time, and it took forever to get the bill and be rang up.  The prices were also too high for the atmosphere.  It was $36 for our lunch, Guinness is $6 a pint.  Monday is $1.50 PBRs but it wasn't Monday and I don't like PBR.  Theme restaurant prices, poor service and a dive bar don't add up to regular stop for me."
2,"Stopped in here this morning for breakfast, joined by Robyn N.  UGH!  I often stop at a McDonald's to eat when I'm out of town, & usually think they're at least 3 Stars, but this one was a real dud today.  To begin with they weren't busy, possibly having as many employees as customers, yet it took us and everyone else a LONG TIME to get our orders from their simple menu!  Not only that, there were no paper towels in the men's bathroom, only those stupid blowers, mounted down near the floor (for 3-year-olds?).  The door opens IN, so how are you supposed to get out of there with your hands clean, wait 'til you can get into a stall to get some toilet paper?\n\nMy breakfast sandwich seemed like it had been sitting around for a long time, too.     :-O\n\nSausage McMuffin with Egg $2.69, Sr. Coffee $.79"
2,"The bagels are good but this morning the service was horrible. I walked in and to my surprise there was only one person ahead of me in line. So I thought to myself, \""great, this should be quick.\"" Well, I was wrong. I sat there for over 20 minutes for two bagels?! \n\nThe employees seemed to be taking their sweet time and messing up orders."
2,I was at the Encore last week for a work function and my company split everyone up at the conference to go to the different high end resturants at the Wynn and Encore. Now I don't like seafood and Italian cuisine is not my favorite so when I found out that I was scheduled to eat dinner here I was a little disaopinted. But I decided to suck it up and not complane and enjoy the expienrence.\n\nWe ended up dining in one of their private rooms and we ended up eating family style. I have to say that I was underwhelmed with the whole experience. The food looked like something my family would make at home  and the service was pretty slow. I had to flag down our server several times to get a drink. It was almost like someone told them not give me alcohol. (Probably my bosses since they know me too well).
2,"I don't get the excitement over these darn biscuits, they aren't good at all. I've been here a few times, food it OK, and prices are OK, but I'm not impressed."
2,"The burgers are just ok, they aren't great. The shakes are horrible though. We have given this place the benefit of the doubt in hopes that it would get better three times now. Every time we have gone we have ordered shakes and every time they have been icy and gross. Honestly, the price is great here, unfortunately the cheap price also means cheap quality."
2,"I think I just don't like El Salvadoran food. It's either that or I accidentally consumed the cardboard and polymer display models in lieu of my actual entree. That was some seriously dry, bland food. Even tossing some watered down hot sauce on that pile of bland meat and carbs didn't really improve the edibility. I had the appetizer platter and the chicken with white rice and weird white sauce with a dry side salad. It was a bland, white platter of food. Plus, what's with the side salad of iceberg and radishes? Is it garnish? It's not dressed with anything and, you know, tastes just like a pile of lettuce. \n\nMaybe I'm just an ignorant prick. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. Maybe I just don't like El Salvadoran (although I love just about everything else Central American). \n\nThe pupusas were crazy delicious though. I would totally return for these. (And only these.)"
2,"I don't know why i have been here more than once, but the parking is horrible, and the food is only so-so.  lots of color and flare but not much going for it.  the baja sauce is great but i seem to get sick later that evening when i eat it.  i need to learn from experience"
2,"So my old lady and I stayed at the *4* star hotel.\nSLS is in a middle old north side strip- pretty ghetto\nSLS Sign and design looks like if AFFLICTION clothing line threw up a hotel.\nI stayed at the Story Tower and the room was very small and the design was horrible.\nThe bed was in the middle of the small room. The sink was directly behind it and the shower and toilet on each side with sliding doors. If you used the mirror or sink and somebody wanted to go in the bathroom it might hit your head.\nThey did not supply a plastic bag in the closet, wait there was no closet it was just a rack and two drawers. \nWORST: There was no ice machine on the floor. So to get ice you had to order ice from in-house dining and then tip the person for the ice. Also if you order more than 2 ice buckets they will charge you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nCarpet was rough, mirror on the ceiling was cool then it got old , bed lights up, it seems trashy design aka\nService was nice, except for the front desk- they were not as nice as everybody else.\nTables were good"
2,Its a nice clean restaurant.  Not authentic Mexican food though. They make their burritos weird and when untold them how I wanted it I was told no I dont want it that way. It made me not even want to get a burrito. I was told that Pico de Gallo is nasty in a burrito and I didn't want it like that. I had to let them know that I am a paying customer and I will have it the way I want it. Its hard to hear them when making an order also. The meat spent have authentic Mexican spices either. This is my last time here.
2,Not my favorite place. I went here with my sis and we split the veggie roll and another shrimp tempura roll and edamame beans. We didnt like any of it. The service was pretty good but other than all of the waters and bartenders being drop dead gorgeous i would not go back for food..
2,"Came here with two other people at 6:40, Happy Hour ends at 7 and our waiter didn't arrive to our table until 7:02 announcing that Happy Hour was unfortunately over. We ordered food and drinks and our waters didn't get there til 7:15, so we sat with no drinks for over a half hour. Btw, the place is empty and it's a Thursday. Our friend asked about the Garden Burger which says \""100% Vegan\"" on the menu and the waiter lets us know that it's not really Vegan because they put Chipotle Ranch on it (and because they use egg to keep it together). \n\nTheir food is decent at best, the service was horrendous."
2,"Soooooo I have had a hard time thinking about what I would write about this place. I love the fact that the cost won't break your bank but my experience hasn't been that great. We had signed up for mommy and me ballet and I've given it a good two months of trying it out. The first class was pretty great and then on our way to class (takes us 15-20 min to get there) about 5 minutes before class started they called me and canceled. Well thanks for the heads up 5 minutes before class was supposed to start....then the next couple of weeks it was just instructors being 15-20 minutes late and then the class was just horrible which we never got the time back that they had missed. The class ranges from 18 months-3 or 4 years? and it was just disappointing the next few weeks of class. The other moms in the class weren't very friendly unless you were apart of their group but I met another \""outsider\"" who had a toddler the same age as mine.  Overall, the experience was not great but I would definitely try a different class or wait till they got a better instructor."
2,Food was so bland. Everything was cooked really well and great portion sizes but overall the food was kinda flavorless.
2,This mall is huge!  Its still pretty vacant since its new....  The stores are overpriced and I'm not sure what to buy.  There are a lot of restaurants and tons of light.  Check it out once..... I probably will never go back.
2,"We just moved back to the Burgh after spending 3 years in California.  We always kept track of what was going in the Burgh so this place was on our short list to try when we returned.  Love the changes inside.  We had been to the place when it was Geno's.  We sat at the bar near the end close to the service area which is NEVER a good idea but they were the only seats at the bar.  The draft selection did have local beers so we liked that.  We ordered the mussels and fish and chips.  Both came out barely warm to the touch.  The sauce for the mussels was delicious, however, they should have been steaming when they were brought out.  I was born in New Zealand so I'm pretty picky about my fish and chips which is kinda stupid since it is a pretty simple dish.  I expected the triple fried fries to be amazing but they were barely warm and soggy.  Weird.  The fish.  Ahhhh the fish.  The batter was crazy bland.  The fish was a thick cut and wasn't cooked all the way through.  Now, the only thing that saved this dish was the mushy peas.  I would go back for the mushy peas and that is all.  Well I might go back for a dark and stormy too.  The bartender was very attentive which is always good.\n\nHow do you screw up fish and chips?"
2,"I just found this place over price! Food was a bit of below average especially \""Malaysia chicken curry\"". I don't think I will ever be back again."
2,"Yes, this place was kind of lame.\n\nThe salsa was unmemorable, and that's a crying shame.\n\nI got a spinch-y burrito of sorts, which was less than amazing... the spinach didn't taste particularly fresh... but at least the whole thing was drenched in cheese - a plus.\n\nConsidering the wealth of other Mexican restaurants in town, I doubt I'll return."
2,"I don't know what the other reviewers ordered but it obviously wasn't what I've been getting the past four weeks I've come to Oakland. I've tried their regular coffee, their lattes, and their iced drinks, and unfortunately I find them all almost undrinkable. As a former barista, I've tried to think of what could have gone wrong, and one place to start is that the coffee tastes as though it had been sitting out for too long before they served me. It also tastes overbrewed, and this is coming from a Starbucks fan! (There is actually a Starbucks right across the street so maybe the intense competition fueled some hasty/bad decision making.) \n\nThat being said, their banana nut pound cakes are to die for, and the atmosphere is nice with stable wifi. So it's not completely hopeless."
2,"This was a second trip to this restaurant, but compared to the first visit......it was not good. Service was slow. Food was disappointing. Took 5 min. To get a fork to eat my meal. The duck was ok, but boring. Served with a medallion potato that could have come from mcdonalds. 2 of the meals were cold and had to be redone. The skirt steak arrived as the rest of us were finishing. And the meat tasted \""old\""..... Not fresh. We were there at 6 and it wasn't crowded, but their excuse was that they were still catching up from an earlier rush. Lame."
2,"I've been to this location a couple of times.  I had a free coupon for them from a place that I got my oil changed at.  Let me tell you, if I didn't get that for free, I would have been asking for my money back.  I don't get my car cleaned (inside) on a regular basis. I have a black lab, who sheds like crazy.  I wasn't expecting my car to be spotless by any means, but when I got back in to my car - there were still things on the foot rugs, the dash wasn't dusted off. It hardly looked like I just got my car cleaned.  Will not be going here to throw away my money."
2,"My husband and I took our daughter here for her birthday brunch after reading all the good reviews about this restaurant. We called the restaurant to make reservations right when they opened  at 11:30 A.M. on a Sunday and they were able to accommodate us at 12:30. My husband mentioned that we were coming here for a birthday brunch and asked if they could do something special for the birthday girl and the gentleman said \""no problem\"" and that they could do some type of brownie Bday dessert. We were seated right away when we got there. I was kind of disappointed with their limited menu. The food's ok - not worthy for the price. I mean...$15 for a one piece, free range grilled chicken with a side of fries on their children's menu (what we ordered for my daughter) so expect to pay $25-30 per person. \n\nKeep reading, this review is almost done.... Our server never brought out the brownie they promised. Complimentary or not, I was willing to pay for it just to make my daughter's Bday brunch extra special so I had to let our server know. They still charged us for the bday brownie dessert and that didn't make us feel special. I didn't say anything because I didn't want to come off as cheap. I've been to many restaurants and Bday and anniversary desserts are always complimentary. We won't come back."
2,"Drinks were unique and delicious, but like everything in Vegas, wildly overpriced.  The food was not memorable at all. As we were eating, we agreed that the high ratings must come from people who enjoyed the atmosphere, which was nice.  We tried 5 or 6 dishes, including the famous duck salad. None of them were worth repeating. \n\nTasty drinks and great service, but food is grossly underwhelming."
2,"The drinks were delish, The appetizers were the best part of the night. The entree, some spicy pasta dish... NOT impressed. Took most of it home and ended up throwing it away."
2,"The Entree that we (group of 4) had was very good, but the Hot Chocolate Lava Cake was not what it was hyped up to be and what I thought was included with my meal was an extra charge. If you want a dessert latte go to McDonalds."
2,"We were a little hesitate to have lunch here because there were only two parties in here. A single old lady and a couple who seemed to know the staff. \n\nWe first started w shrimp chow mein. It was a typical chow mein. Flavors were nice, portions were big but lacking the plentiful of bean sprouts I usually like in my noodles. The menu was pretty standard for an asian restaurant, beef, chicken, soups, shrimp etc...\n\nSecond we ordered squid w snow peas and I think a bean sauce, but that's not what came out. We tried it anyway but the squid was really bland and wasn't seasoned at all. I couldn't eat this.\n\nLastly we got as advertised, fresh live fish. It was sea bass today and to choose between steamed or fried, we got steamed. Being said it was live fresh fish I though i'd get a whole fish. I didn't. It was nice and moist, very good, but could have used some lemon, although I don't think that's traditional for this type of food. \n\nOverally I give it a 2 out of 5."
2,"Been here 3 times now - mixed feelings.\n\nUnfortunately the last 2 times the staff seemed disinterested in providing any reasonable level of service.\n\nFirst time they made an incredible vegetarian sandwich for the wife - enough she wanted to go back!  My burger was delicious too.  Service was great!\n\nSecond time, our meals were a little less stellar.  Service was fair. ad - and I try LOTS if cobbler (my mom could make some awesome cobblers).\n\nThird time, meals were sub-par, service was almost non-existent."
2,Good food but service was not. Might be back.  There was a woman at the bar that should have been cut off. Was very loud. The place was clean
2,"When will I learn my lesson? Since the \""raids\"" the quality of the staff has gotten really horrible. Terribly aggressive greeters who are trying to upsell you so hard that it gets really uncomfortable. Also, at the end of the line, I'vehad so many things left undone and they expect me to just pull away. On a recent visit, I had the entire passenger side cleaned with a Armourall soaked rag! When I complained, the young woman just walked away to the gas station convenience store and came back with a bag of Funyuns-I'm not kidding! While they tried to remove the Armourall, all Funyun Jane did was shove those yellow circles in her pie hole. They had to run it through the wash again because it wouldn't come off. Needless to say, when waiting an hour to get your car cleaned is ridiculous. I complained to the manager. She shrugged it off. So done. So crappy. I'm off the carousel for good.."
2,"Been to the one in Green Valley. It was better. We got the Quatro Fromagi. Crust was soggy and impossible to eat without a knife and fork. \nI like Motley Crue but as the musical choice for a gourmet pizza place, uh try again. \nDecor is dark and uninviting. Find a new interior designer. Looks like the old Posh Burger which went belly up in 4 months. \n\nNot sure how the Health Department passed the wood tables. Not enough sealant on the surface to keep out the last patron's food, crumbs and bits of the cloth used to wipe down the tabletop. \nOn the plus side, the involtini was good. \nNot compelling enough to bring me back."
2,"Yea, Blu Basil looks like an airport restaurant, and it has potential, but their prices are too high. It should be $ instead of $$."
2,"I reallly want to like you Moe's.  I do.  I live so close and you are sooo convenient.  BUT.... I ventured out for a taco salad last week, excited for some mexican delicousness with a side of my favorite condiment, guac.  What I got was a flavorless chicken salad with so so guac on the side.  Even my bf agreed my guac is better and not only am I not a \""cook\"", I am also not of Mexican heritage.  I expected much much better.  Dang.  I am still looking for that authentic Mexican taste in a quick take out, and I know it's out there..."
2,Pretty good BBQ but I find the prices to be a bit over priced. You get huge portions though. I consider the food closer to 3 stars but I received really bad service last time we were there. Which normally I would chalk up to someone having a bad day but the gentleman behind the counter who happened to be African American was much nicer to EVERYONE who he helped after us. I not usually one who notices if I am treated differently but it was blatant as he was giving out samples and being super friendly with everyone else when he barely even spoke to me or asked what I wanted to order. I don't know if race truly played a part of he just didn't like my smile but it put me off for sure and was pretty upsetting. Overall its nice because they give you free ice cream and my kids (who happen to be bi-racial) LOVE the ham! I will be back again I just hope that I get treated better next time.
2,"The seafood prepared here was the least fresh I have had in Phoenix. I've had better results with the Sushi at Safeway or Trader Joes. The beer and wine menu also needs something to separate itself from every other restaurant. If you're looking for Sushi on the far West side, the only joint left after the demise of Be Sushi is Koi (across from the Arrowhead Harkins)."
2,"I hope I have to change this review later....the SkySong farmers market tried. I guess being its first day it leaves it a lot of room to improve. Sad selection of fresh produce (2?3? booths?)...mostly just expensive cheese, expensive jelly, expensive lotion/creams....etc. \nThis venue has a lot of potential being that it's a great location and I love the strangely magical design of SkySong itself. I think i'll go back just because its close by and I really want it to grow and be a little less pathetic next time.... good luck skysong!"
2,It looks better than it tastes.  No amazing combination that makes me say I have to go back there for that burger. The onion rings were good that was the only item that was good. Frozen burger patty. Nothing special. Costs as much as a burger at Hillstone but no where near the quality. The restaurant is also very dirty. It serves the hangover late night crowd who does not notice the dirt. Our thoughts.
2,"I was expecting this place to have Korean karaoke machines, but was unexpectedly faced with a hard to use bootlegged Chinese counterpart. Not only was it impossible to search for songs, the device lacked the ability to give us real karaoke soundtracks. Half the time, our group was trying hard to sing louder than the singers recorded into the karaoke, and the other half of the time was spent trying to find songs that we knew.\n\nThe location and service was nothing too amazing and would have certainly merited a four-star if it wasn't for the fact that they didn't have real KTVs capable of delivering real karaoke soundtracks, a UI with search functions, and English speaking employees."
2,"This place it trash. I didn't really even want to walk in. I was gunna try and sell my stuff here, but I quickly changed my mind after walking in. The purses and clothes are pretty worn down and extremely overpriced. A lot of the purses were fake and were being sold for prices that were high for even a real, used purse. They sell other things besides clothes like jewelry and hair accessories for really cheap but its not really worth it. They have cheap gages which was the only redeeming factor. I'm definitely not going to go back here."
2,"Bad service, mediocre food, long long wait times.  We specifically ask for wings before our meal because for some reason, servers think a person will enjoy their dinner to be cold sitting on a table while we eat an appetizer.  Was no different here, waited 25 minutes for our appetizer and then receive our actual meal 2.5 minutes later, yeah I was being exact.  What the french toast?!"
2,"I paid $46 on Expedia. Location of the hotel was good for our visit to Glendale. Friendly staff throughout the facility. Free hot breakfast. Room was fine. I actually sighed with relief at the condition of the room because the halls, elevator, carpet, furniture in the lobby were not just dated they were dirty. While I was at breakfast I noticed they have a nice patio. The day was nice so I hoped to have breakfast there. The tables and chairs had not been cleaned in weeks. That  bothers me because there were three staff members talking off to the side of the dining area and only 3 seated eating  breakfast."
2,"Came in here for lunch today and although I was seated promptly, the service was very very slow and it was hard to get a server's attention. I had decided what I wanted to order and still no one was coming around to take my order until it got down to me staring at the waitstaff. I wound up ordering their smoked meat spaghetti which was being advertised. It was good although I'm not crazy about smoked meat but I figured I'd try it anyways. The other thing that sadly has landed this review down to two stars is the price. For what I had, the price was a little steep for my liking and refills on my soda weren't free which I suppose I should have thought to ask. Anyways, I may or may not come back depending on who I'm with..but I probably won't if I'm on my own like I was today."
2,Grumpy Ranger Mike Garcia sets an unwelcome tone. Sorry to have disturbed his day by visiting. As a public face of such a great site it soured the visit from the very start. The movie was OK the ruins were OK but hey put a better people person as your front register guy.
2,"I have heard a lot of great reviews and after multiple trips to Las Vegas over the years we finally decided to check it out. The show was entertaining, but became redundant. When the show was over I left asking myself, \""That's it?\"". I do not think it was worth the money we paid for those tickets. I have seen the show, checked it off my list and will not be going back."
2,We are locals but we came here with friends . . The service was awful our waitress was rude & un attentive \n\nWe started off with drinks their frozen daiquiris were good! Then we had the fried mac and cheese nom noms omg they were really good! \n\nMy burger however was terrible I ordered a cheeseburger with everything it came with bacon which was an add on I had never mentioned it also didn't come with fries ? What kind of burger doesn't come with fries? If you want fries be sure to ask for them when you order  . . It was also cold and under cooked the middle was dark pink. . The cheese on the burger was scare In all it was a terrible burger which makes me think that they Don't Love Burgers. I won't be going back :/
2,"Sammy's Beach Bar and Grille is unfortunately pretty typical of airport fare; overpriced previously frozen food and less than stellar service. With all of that being said my wife and I hit this place with a high level of frequency when flying out of McCarran. Why you ask? The Waborita! As pedestrian as the nachos and chili-cheese fries may be, the over-priced Waborita is pretty darn good. You may want to sit at the bar though, as service is brutally slow at this location.\n\n  Sammy's does do a lot of charity work in the community which makes a stop here slightly more palatable. So if you're a little early for your flight suck it up and have a Waborita. As expensive as it may be, it's a pretty good drink."
2,"Yet another steak house in las vegas.  I happened to be staying at the Palazzo and had heard good things about this place.  I mean c'mon its Mario Batali's steak house its gotta be good right? Not so much.\n\n1st I gotta say the hostess was OMG beautiful.  I will be going back just for a chance to run into her again. \n\nThe highlight of the evening (besides the hostess) was a hand made ravioli with some sort of duck sauce.  Just a great dish.  Not heavy at all and bursting with flavor.\n\nThe low was my bone in rib eye for two.  We had requested it Medium and it came out twitching.  They cut the steak for you and serve you, i can only imagine how much blood there was before it reached my plate.   Maybe my palate isn't sophisticated enough to enjoy the flavors of meat cooked this way but cooked is the key word.  This steak just wasn't. \n\nOverall a expensive dinner that left me feeling completely unsatisfied. \n\nI will give Carnevino this, they have a great wine selection."
2,"funny seems like they rave about the wings, but not the customer, we usually get a local deal for them($5 food credit in the mail).. So we get them now and then, but I must agree , these are dry and not so tasty wings, it is best to put sauce on the side and they do take at least 10-15 mins to take your order and then another 20-30 mins to get them to go... I think they just want you to spend $$ on the their tight slot machines, while you wait for your order???"
2,"Meh...stayed here because I got to use my Hilton honors points. The customer service was excellent so they get 2 stars but the hotel is a mess! I thought it was newly renovated?!? The bathrooms were filthy! The ceramic on the bathtub was peeling so it looked dirty and the water pressure was so weak! The faucet was leaky so it was annoyed because of the dripping noise. There was dust everywhere!!!  The person checking me in told me I was upgraded to a strip view...ummmm, yeah it was nice to see the side of MGM. Smh! Nice try! If this was the upgrade I wonder what the standard room looked like?!? The small chair in the room was all stained. The bed were comfy enough. All in all...it looked like an old Vegas hotel. I won't be staying here again!"
2,"Attended the @SpaFitFinder launch party, with @spacephx.\n\nI can't say much about the place, other than, even taking into consideration the number of people present, it felt cramped.\n\nThe TrimTini (?) I had was really delicious; vodkatini with lemon zest.\n\nA very nice gentleman, who works at Urban 7, was very gracious in making sure to stop by every time he brought out a new platter of hors d'oeuvres. Everything he brought was delicious, including the ceviche, which I'm not particularly fond of.\n\nUrban 7 isn't the type of place I'm attracted to, so it's not likely I will return any time soon.\n\nBut it was a nice event, and I enjoyed myself."
2,I have been to this location several times in the past year and each time I have been fairly disappointed.  The staff at this location are not necessarily rude but they don't not go out of their way to be helpful.  This Ulta is always short of something when I go in for my buy 2-get 1 free hair products...ALWAYS!!!  They seem to have a smaller selection of products then their counterpart at Best of the West.
2,Very nice consistent meal.  We ate breakfast as we usually do when we come to Denny's.  It's a good place to bring the family and get a good meal at a reasonable price.  I had to lower a star for the slow service due to lack of staffing.
2,"The steak was good, but not particularly impressive at $40 per plate. I got the Surf and Turf special with scallops, and two 5oz filet. The filets were good, cooked perfectly, and great cuts of meat. Just not wowed. The real disappointment was in the scallops that came with the dish. For the class of the place, one expects a certain level, and those scallops didn't even come close."
2,"I found that KFC has really changed things.. and I am.. not sure it is for the better . \nThe chicken is VERY salty. TOO salty. \nBut i like their mashed potatoes and their coleslaw and mac n cheese. and the biscuits are good. \nI don't think that i would make this a habit, AT ALL."
2,"All right.  If you're a straight lady going to Hooters then you're going for the wings.  Am I right?  Unless you're trying to prove something.  And I think I've been good about saying this - heck, I haven't had to say it yet because the QC has been a pleasant surprise for the most part - but every Hooters in Chicagoland has better wings than this Hooters.  Hell, the Hooters in Puerto Vallarta had better wings.  These were not as flavorful, the batter was not as... I don't know, flakey I suppose.  They were extremely mediocre.  Now I prefer to go to a small local joint over a chain most of the time, I prefer to try something new.  So dang it, if I want Hooters wings, they need to taste like Hooters wings!  Standardization, people!\n\nBah. Well, the server was sweet at least.  Sometimes when a couple walks into a Hooters, they get snubbed a bit because the waitresses are all leaning over the horny businessman tables trying to get tips. But Shaun (I think that was how it was spelled) was nice."
2,"My wife and I have been going to Thursday night dinner at House of Blues for many years, as we enjoy seeing some of our favorite local bands play during dinner. Last night was the first time we have been there in a couple months, and were severely disappointed.\n\nTo start the night off poorly, the hostess placed us, essentially, on the casino floor in the farthest table from the stage. We asked if we could have one of the empty tables closer to the stage, being told \""no, there is no server for that section.\"" Before our drink order was taken, there were people seated at those empty tables.\n\nThen, looking at the menu, we were even more disappointed and aggravated. We expect to pay more than normal restaurant prices to eat at House of Blues. However, $3.99 for an ice cream scoop of luke warm/cold mashed potatoes and the same price for an equal amount of snap peas is asinine. \n\nTheir entire menu has drastically gone up in price and down in selection. None of the good items are available anymore.\n\nThe only reason two stars got marked, after talking to one of the floor managers, she apologized at the illogical reason we were not permitted to sit at quality tables, moved us to a better section and comp'd us some drinks and dessert. Our servers were also pretty on top of things. \n\nAfter having that first, bad experience as we got to the restaurant, it tilted the night's mood."
2,The seats are very uncomfortable. The first two we sat in were broken. They are old and dirty. We went to see the screening of a Metropolitan Opera performance. There was quite a bit of sound from the theater next door. The popcorn tastes like it has been sitting for a while. The imitation butter has no butter flavor. You have to put it on yourself so the top of the bag is soaked and the bottom has none. There is no flavored salt like the Harkin Theater provide. \n\nThe Met has a great program in a poor venue.
2,"Mediocre food. 50$ for one person. I could have had better food at Panda Express. The orange peel chicken was cold and lacking flavor. The veggies in the dish tasted like they weren't washed before being cooked. Only good thing about this place is the atmosphere, it is the only reason I didn't give it 1 star."
2,"Mediocre at best, slight step up from Denny's. The biscuits were made from bisquick , there was no sausage in the anemic gravy and the chicken fried steak was just breaded hamburger. The Apple Danish was good though."
2,"It's true that Five Guys serves up a good burger and their fries have a nice flavor, but for me, it doesn't really stand out from the rest of the average fast food burger chains out there. Being in the mall and coined as a \""fast food\"" spot, I have been disappointed with their service twice now. The first time, we waited over 20 minutes for our burgers and fries, but I thought it might just be a fluke. Sadly though, last night the same thing happened again. I was surprised that the wait was was so long for such simple food and also since this is a fast food place. The staff was also very rude when we asked about our food after waiting so long. The wait resulted in us being late for the movie. I won't be eager to visit 5 Guys again, unless I have a lot of time. Then again, if I have a lot of time, I won't choose a \""fast food\"" spot and instead go to a sit down restaurant. I hope they fix their service and turnaround time."
2,"For such an upscale hotel, I expected better fare, a better menu and better service.\nMore like a bar menu.\nThe ambiance was nice,,,but burgers and wrap? Come on!\nI had a mediocre caesar salad...nothing special (except the price$$$).\nThe Aria mall is pristine and upscale---as it should be."
2,"Seriously 35 bucks a head?  The mac and cheese station was a cool idea, but seriously the mac and cheese was runny and it just didnt work, the desserts could of been richer and a better selection.  The salads were good, they had a marscapone infused polenta that was excellent.  No big shrimp cocktail, the crab legs were luke warm and not hot, its a nice dining area, servers were quick and attentive, but for the price this not a deal, or a buffet I will go to again.  The asian area only had 3 items, and the sushi selection was HORRIBLE, no ahi no sashimi or nigiri, the rolls looked lame and like something you would find at a gas station in barstow."
2,"I must admit to being totally underwhelmed with our dining experience at Strip Steak, Mandalay Bay.\n\nFirstly the time between ordering and receiving our food was lengthy  although the restaurant didn't appear to be very full. When  we did receive our dinner,  nothing was piping hot. \n\nI had the chop and I think it was probably the blandest piece of meat I have ever eaten.  Totally devoid of any flavor what so ever.  My companions who both ordered the Filet Mignon, found they were  satisfactory but neither completely finished their steaks as they just weren't that good. \n \nThe duck fat fries were delicious, truffle mac and cheese was okay.  The asparagus was nice, but the mushrooms were cold.  The selection of desserts was poor although the cheese cake was very light and delicious. \n\n As I said a totally underwhelming dining experience.   Frankly I would have been disappointed if I we had eaten this meal at a steakhouse with a mid range price point but this meal cost over $400.00. \nI would recommend skipping Strip Steak if you wish to avoid being disappointed."
2,I love Flame Broiler. But this one is a bit harder to enjoy. Food was not as good as I usually get. But my biggest beef was the music - it was so loud that it was hard to hear the woman behind the counter as I was ordering. I said the music was really loud. She just smiled at me. Maybe she couldn't hear me? \n\nI may return but won't eat in again.
2,"The service was very good and quick. Ordered a Octoberfest burger and guest a cheeseburger. \nThe amount of Fries served was more than enough where asking for endless ones was not needed. Can't say either of us was impressed with the burgers. Both of us thought it was similar to meatloaf or had a filler (though that's doubtful). Don't mind spending $10 for a burger, but IMO this one was not worth it."
2,"Our group decided to come here for Sunday brunch. Prices range from 7.95 to 10.95 for breakfast or lunch. Some of us ordered the eggs benedict which was actually good. The turkey lunch was all right, the mash potatoes tasted like it was boxed and the stuffing was too salty. Someone also ordered eggs, fruit and croissant which was fine. The reason I'm giving two stars was the POOR SERVICE. Entering, the host didn't acknowledge us. No greeting at all. Not even a BON JOUR! The waiter never introduced himself. He seemed annoyed half the time. He didn't smile and was not friendly. Maybe the attitude is supposed to represent being in France (the total French experience) or he hated his job and he didn't want to be there. This company needs to revisit customer service 101 to their employees. I think we would of received better service at Denny's or Village Inn."
2,"So overrated! I had my birthday dinner here and they messed up almost everything. My friend had croutons on her salad despite ordering it gluten-free, my sister's burger was burned to a crisp, they gave my grandma jalapenos on her sandwich which was ordered without them. The beer is good but other than that it's a no. They allow smoking on the patio and the smell gets into the restaurant and it is so gross. Go to Four Peaks instead"
2,Ok place. Good for beer and relaxing. Just plan on staying a while. Sat at a table for 15-20 minutes before a server took our drink order. It took 30 minutes to get food and after asking for the check it took aboit 20 minutes before our server dropped it off. I might come back if I'm planning on staying a while. Other wise I'll try a place that pays more attention to the service.
2,"Pasta: over-cooked Lasagna, drenched in Cheese, no Bechamel.\nPizza: dough and sauce okay, way too much cheese, boring\n\nService: unattentive old man. \nAtmosphere: Vinyl tablecloth, tacky deco, could be in the Bronx\n\nNo reason to ever go back."
2,"So my bf and I decided to eat here last week, I ordered the ahi sliders as and app plus I ordered the I love bacon burger, both weren't as good as I wanted it to be. The slider buns they use didn't match the flavor of the fish and ponzu sauce. The burger had no sauce on it so I didn't even want to finish my burgers. My bf ordered the jalapeno burger and he also didn't eat it all.. I'll probably try it again they might of just had a bad day"
2,The service was incredibly slow and the waiter and bartenders ignored our group. \n\nI have eaten here once more before and did not have the best experience. I was reluctant to go back but my friends are new to the area and wanted to try it out.\n\nThe atmosphere is very nice though.
2,"Spent 5 days in Vegas and this was the highest priced meal bill that I had.  That includes buffets at the Wynn and Studio B at the M Resort. \nWe were looking for something without a long wait.  Seated quickly, nice service, \nBut my goodness!  Way too expensive for a burger and fries!\nFood is all \""a la carte\"".\nNo, there are better choices out there."
2,"Things I liked: The homemade chips (mmm), the red salsa, the tender chicken pieces in my enchiladas and the service.\n\nThings that just didn't work for me- The green sauce was so blah I couldn't eat it without dousing it in the red to get a little flavor. The beans and rice were disappointing as well. Perhaps it is my lack of familiarity with New Mexican cuisine, but I was not impressed."
2,"What Mexican Restaurant charges you for chips and salsa? That's just ridiculous. The food was ok, but after 2 beers and 2 margaritas, the bill was quite high and I felt like I'd have gotten more for my money had I gone for prime rib over enchiladas. There are definitely better Mexican Restaurants to visit on the West Side of Madison."
2,"the gado gado sauce was great but the chicken was overly fried. the sauce in the mixed veggies was just way too thick, way too salty and probably loaded with msg."
2,"The service here was terrible, probably the worst for me this visit.  The food is overpriced and the seasoning on the cheese curds was not fitting for the food item, over powering.  The one thing going for this place is the amount of TVs with sports on it, just a shame it's right next to the sports book with all the same TVs on."
2,Food was ok. Your normal wings. My only complaint was that we tried to enjoy a nice night our side and the patio was pretty dirty. Somebody should go out on a regular schedule and sweep.
2,"Not sure about the other valley locations but tonight's meal at the N. Scottsdale location that replaced Mark Gerding's Thai Pan was a disappointment. \n\nIn a nutshell, the owners need to scrap the plan to add a sushi bar (at a Thai restaurant?  Remember, it didn't work for Malees either) and focus on building the flavors and textures in their Thai dishes.  Creating heat in a dish takes more than adding red chili pepper flakes, and yes most can tell the difference in the texture of canned vs. fresh pinneapple. The peanut sauce was very tasty and the red curry was OK after my husband doctored it up with a tray of hot sauces that were brought out when he asked for them but other than that the 3 other dishes we ordered were mediocre at best.\n\nI'm still trying to DIGEST the reviewer who actually wrote that \""This place doesn't cater to \""dumbed down\"" American palettes. This is authentic Thai food with that indescribable combination of spices and flavorings.\""  Dude needs to go to the doctor and get his tongue examined! \n\nFor now, when my family's need a Thai fix we'll stick with Swaddee and Sala Thai."
2,"Meh.  I've experienced better. (haha Yelp took the words right out of my mouth).\n\nSo I came here over the weekend looking for some Taiwanese breakfast and figured Chinatown must have it.  Got to Chinatown, saw \""YongHe\"" outside which means Taiwanese breakfast so I was pretty excited when I went in.  \n\nI'm grateful that they are attempting Taiwanese style breakfast but I feel bad for the people that actually think this is good.  Being a Szechuan restaurant, naturally they would have a lot of spicy food.  I ordered a beef wrap/roll and some Chinese donuts (youtiao).  Pretty much it was different cuts of beef marinated in chili oil that's usually served as a cold appetizer but then they stick it in the middle of a shaobing (Taiwanese-style bread). Kinda of a lazy way of doing things. I guess it is smart, using the same ingredients for 2 different dishes haha. Not really authentic. The youtiao was pretty good.  Kinda hard to mess THAT up since it is just frying dough!\n\nTheir soymilk tastes like soymilk and the fantuan (rice roll) looked ok but that's hard to mess up too.  Overall for a Taiwanese breakfast place, it's whatevvvss.\n\nService wasn't the greatest either.  We waited over 15 minutes to hand our order slip to the waiter and the tea took forever to arrive.  It seemed like they were understaffed but the restaurant wasn't even half full.. Maybe dinner service would be better but it's not really on my radar anymore."
2,"What the hell? Why do people say the drinks are strong? We got shots, yes SHOTS of vodka and they were watered-down (plus overpriced). I've definitely had better.\n\nPlus, the promoter who wanted us to come to the club said there was an open bar. Lies! I don't like people who lie! Or their nightclubs\n\nOh, and don't expect the lounge to play Beatles music. The demographic here is all over the place - 20-30yo's plus 50+ (based upon defining characteristics such as hair color and attire). I think most people come here after the Cirque show, as there are people standing outside the show passing out free entrance passes.\n\nBathrooms also use a shared sink that's activated with your foot. Are we at a baseball stadium?"
2,"Poorly stocked and ghetto. There isn't really much to say other than watch your back. They are always poorly stocked and the store is a mess, then you need an employee for assistance just forget it. Drive the extra 10 minutes for a better Walmart. The only reason I shop here is because I get lazy and don't want to drive further."
2,"I brought my wife here for a special meal.  I mean, after all, the reviews were very kind and so I figured it would be a nice place to come. They sat us right away and I was expecting a nice Italian dinner.  The waitress was very nice, however, the food lacked completely.  My wife and I both ordered fettuccine alfredo, and I'm sorry to report that there was absolutely no taste in the food.  There was no garlic, no flavors that you would expect in a (expensive) Italian meal.  When the waitress asked how everything was, we were very honest.  I explained that there was no flavor in the food, to which she apologized.  She brought terimisu (sp?) out complementary at the end, but again, even that lacked flavor.  I hate to say it, but Olive Garden has more flavor, and we despise going there!  This is my suggestion - go to the grocery store, buy your own ingredients, buy a bottle of wine, and have a stay at home date with your partner.  Not only will it be cheaper, but the flavors you can create yourself will beat this restaurant any day."
2,"Boating today in Madison and stopped here for lunch.  Nice and sunny on the deck. The food sounded great.  I got the shrimp po boy, two others in our party got the tuna steak sandwich and another got the chicken panini.  All of us took our first few bites and each said, \""It's okay.\""  The chicken in the panini was a bit too tough, the tuna steak was overcooked and the po boy was five pieces of shrimp, lettuce and tomato in a big, fat white bread bun.  My sweet potato fries had too much batter on them to make them crispy.  Frozen from a bag?  Seemed to be.  What ever happened to actual fries?  Now they add all of this junk on the outside to make them better?  Not in my opinion.  Next time we're boating the lakes in Mad-town, we will skip Bourbon Street Grille and head to the Green Lantern."
2,"Great service and atmosphere. The food and drinks are way overpriced though. If you like your Mexican food mild to bland, this is the place for you."
2,"Huge disappointment!\n\nWe were debating between the Weekend Champagne Brunch at Bellagio and The Wynn. We eventually decided on The Wynn due to other reviews saying the Bellagio looked like a cafeteria and the atmosphere was much better at The Wynn.\n\nThe food was mediocre at best. Cold entrees, dry fish, overcooked prime rib, watery crab legs. The only highlight was the shrimp (16-20 count). Other than that the only memorable thing about this buffet was the price: $50pp with tax and tip. NOT WORTH IT!"
2,We made it back here to give them another try. While the food wasn't terrible it wasn't amazing either. I stand by my original review. I had to add salt and pepper to my steak because it lacked flavor. Also this piece of prime rib was mostly fat. I cook steaks at home and know all about marbeling and how it gives flavor but there needs to be an even balance between the fat and meat otherwise you just feel ripped off. I still feel going to Outback Steakhouse will give you better tasting steaks with lower prices. The location on Chandler Blvd had never disappointed. Sorry Firebirds you're just not for us.
2,"Drove from union county for fried chicken and onion rings.  They have removed onion rings from the menu!!  Why?  They were amazing.  Fried chicken was cooked in old oil, and I do mean OLD.  They should utilize a filter agent or change oil more often.  Have been a patron for years, this will not encourage my continued patronage."
2,"We here for their lunch buffet, very disappointing. It got a scummy dirty feeling and the service sucked. I was hoping that the food would be its saving grace but no. Dry, to greasy, and just horrible. Too many better choices to ever go here."
2,"Delicious & Best Chinese Food...not an apt name.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the food isn't bad, but it's also not very good either. The Chicken Chow Mein tastes absolutely delicious though, which happens to come with all of the Combinations and All-Day Specials...which are a good deal at $4.95 and $6.95 respectively.\n\nThe items are rather hit and miss on the menu. I enjoyed the Kung Pao Chicken and Szechuan Chicken, but everything else has proved to be rather disappointing. I was very disappointed to find that the Honey Garlic Chicken is essentially the same thing as Sweet and Sour Chicken, only with a nastier sauce. \n\nAs mentioned before, the Chicken Chow Mein is fantastic, but the Chicken Fried Rice is pretty horrendous. The two times I've had it, it was relatively tasteless and there were pieces of uncooked rice in the mix. The meals also come with an unremarkable Egg-Drop soup...neither good nor bad.\n\nAlso, they REALLY skimp on the meat to vegetable ratio. I order my food without vegetables at this place, and the guy behind the counter always cheekily asks,\""So, you want Chicken Chow Mein and a little bit of meat.\"" That's already sort of what I was expecting, but I thought it was a bit goofy that he would just come out and say it.\n\nHonestly, this place is worthy of skipping. The only reason I ever tried this joint is because I did my laundry at Launderland three doors down. Now that ithe laundromat is out of business, it's likely I'll never return to D&B."
2,"What a lame show! Holly has no talent (no acting, no dancing) other than a beautiful body and she doesn't have to say much so that's almost a bonus. The supporting singers and dancers did a great job and would have been better off without her. I got about 4 minutes of laughs out of the show but had to fight falling asleep for the rest of it.\n\nThere must be better shows in Las Vegas to spend your money on!"
2,"Keeping it short and to the point. Tao was o.k. A friend of mine said she tried 3 times but could nver get in and finally she'd made it in. We were herded around then they finally began to allow us in. The Door man was sweet and took a second to explain the entire layout prior to stamping my wrist.\nWe took a stroll around- food looked good, decor was really nice, adequate number of bars. Unfortuantely every one and his aunt Susy was there that night and how the pushed and they shoved with little utterance of an excuse me. \nThat really put a damper on our moods. Then went up to Tao beach. It was way smaller than I expected. The pools at MGM are like 8 times the size of this area. No room to sit or dance here either so we get ready to head downstairs...oh BUT WAIT THERE IS A LINE- yes A LINE to WAIT in to go back downstairs. Then I noticed each time we moved from a diffrent level the DJs seemed to be playing almost the same song(s).  I had the experience but it was worse than going to A Hollywood club and they didn't have bacon wrapped dogs waiting outside! WTh!"
2,How could a seafood restaurant this mediocre can event survive?  The Sancerre 2010  would have been the saving grace if they actually made it (not).
2,"Went last night for first time only because we had a gift cert.  Not impressed. Server was odd, table was crammed in a corner, flies everywhere ..... Just a weird menu selection.  We won't return."
2,"No, Samba at The Mirage was a major disappointment.   And I should have known based on the other reviews here.  Go to another Brazilian Steakhouse in town, even it is more expensive.  Here they tried to stuff us with large pieces of chicken, dry sausages, and even garlic bread on their skewers before they bring the sirloin and lamb.  Then he cuts two bite- size pieces of beef off the roast.  I am thinking, okay, I will get more beef later.  No, when they have gone through all the rounds, they stop coming by.   Granted, when I asked for more sirloin, the staff brought out a bit more.  The plantains, rice and beans are good.  The dessert (creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e) was awful - tasted as if had been sitting in the fridge for several days."
2,"My boyfriend and I got take out from here tonight. We've been to the restaurant once and I remembered thinking it was good. \n\nTonight we got the bruschetta which was fine. It wasn't amazing. For our entree he got the blackened chicken pasta, which I tried. It tasted like this chef boyardie thing I used to eat when I was a kid. I got the four cheese pizza. Not the worst pizza I've ever had, however definitely not the best. There was barely any sauce and the cheese tasted plasticy. \n\nNothing to brag about."
2,"My friends and I strolled into this restaurant because the patio seemed to be the only happening spot in the entire village.  There was a man playing live music inside which could be heard outside, it was the perfect setting for a relaxing evening. \n\nI ordered a carne asada burrito.  My carne asada was a generous portion served with a side of beans and rice.  The carne seemed more like ground beef and the taste was a little bland.  My boyfriend ordered the chimichanga and was also \""just so\"" with his choice.  The general consensus from everyone around the table was that the food was not horrible but definitely not something to write home about.  From the 6 dishes we ordered, it seems as if the chicken fajitas were the best choice.\n\nThe margaritas were watered down and the other alcoholic drinks weren't very strong, especially for the price that was paid.  Definitely don't go in expecting to get your buzz on, unless of course you order straight shots, then maybe you can be on a good one.  \n\nOur waiter Omar was really nice, he gets 5 stars if I could just rate on staff alone.  But this is for overall experience.\n\nNext time I am in town, I will probably skip this place and will try something else out, or maybe I would stop in for a shot of tequila, but otherwise, I'd skip the food!"
2,"The pizza here is way undercooked. It seems to be a theme in Pittsburgh in general to not cook the pie long enough for it to crisp up and the cheese to get golden. The sauce was pretty generic and tasted like cheap stuff from a jar. The price was fair at about $2 a slice. The workers at the counter were friendly. However, the pizza itself is just doughy/rubbery and pretty bland."
2,"Decent place, friendly staff, but poor wine list.  I asked the staff about the list and was told the owners only want to carry wines that nobody else does.  My guess is that they want to carry wines that you are not familiar with so you don't know how badly you are getting ripped off.  I had a $10 glass of a $11 bottle of wine (retail).  It was ok, and I expect high prices at a bar but I at least want a decent glass."
2,"The only thing I enjoyed was sitting outside and people watching. \n\nMy husband and I came for dessert and drinks and it definitely wasn't worth what we paid (like many places on the strip). \n\nThe martinis were tasty, but not $16 tasty...worth about $10 in my book. I had high expectations for the desserts (it's called the Sugar Factory after all...) and they fell short. I feel like I could have made my fruit tart at home with a flakier, less \""hope this fork doesn't bend when I cut this\"" crust. My husband's chocolate cake thing had beautiful presentation but was way too rich. I get that that was the point, but it was more ganache-like than I would have liked. \n\nProbably wont go here again, nor would I recommend to friends."
2,"Part of the City Art Centre this is unfortunately not as good as the attraction it services. A fairly soul-less though bright enough high-ceilinged room, at \u00a36 their cooked breakfast is not good value & you'll definitely find better for less elsewhere."
2,"Well, I USED to be obsessed with this place. I didn't come in for about a month and on my recent visit, everything was different. The menu changed and they took off a lot of my favorite rolls. Didn't seem like there were as many options as before. \n\nThe saddest part of my visit was that they no longer have the all you can drink draft beer as an add on for all you can eat.  To be honest that's one of the main reasons we would all come here, because who wants to pay $7 for ONE beer when you can pay $4.99 for all you can drink draft Sapporo?! Nobody, that's who! \n\nNeedless to say, I probably won't be frequenting this location anymore. There's plenty of other good sushi restaurants with cheaper AYCE and alcohol specials. Yes they're farther from my house but this place has lost its luster. If it was still the awesome Sushi Bomb I knew and loved, we would still all be going there!"
2,"I am a big fish taco fan, and to my disappointment this place did not live up to the hype. Food was just average. Margaritas are just alright. The ingredients seemed cheap. Perhaps their fame comes from being the only Mexican restaurant in NoDa, I wouldn't dare to say it is because of their food. I had the blackened mahi mahi signature tacos and  \""meh\"" is all I have to say. Best fish tacos? Seriously?? Only if you have low fish tacos standards."
2,"Be careful, all sales are final and the owner won't allow even a store credit for return of brand new merchandise.  Unfortunate, otherwise a lovely store with nice salespeople and a really good selection of merchandise."
2,"Loved the fish tacos!  But wow, what happened to this place over the past twenty years since I first started eating there?  I know the KFC/Chandler city battle years ago took its toll due to politics and winning and keeping the location... but come on -- update the place please or at least clean things!  20-year old decor isn't acceptable given horrific chairs, tables and more.  Also wtf is there a BBQ guy outside in the entry area doing with his food and aromas?  I don't get it.  The BBQ smells didn't mix with the fish tacos or beer that we had ordered.  Memories are great but apparently they are better than what exists today. No mas."
2,"One of the first Indian restaurants I have ever eaten at. Actually I think it might of been the first. I don't know if that disqualifies me from being a half decent critic. But I have eaten tonnes of Indian food since, and this place just didn't cut it. The food was bland, uninspired, and presented in a sloppy fashion. Granted it is Indian food, but I believe that Indian unfairly gets a bad rap for being mishmash food. I think this place gets away with serving sub par Indian food, I do not recommend it."
2,"I study a lot.  Finding places to study in Glendale isn't easy.  Paradise is the best of the \""easy\"" options I've found around school.  They have plenty of plugs, halfway reliable wifi, and pretty good (unlimited) coffee.  Oh, and the free samples of cookies and bread are also nice when you're in the realm of $250,000 in debt.\n\nThat being said, nothing here is particularly worth it's cost.  The coffee is \""generic dark\"" or \""flavored\"".  I take my coffee pretty seriously, so this was the first major sin they committed upon my person.  The food is also WAY overpriced for the quality.  This place is supposed to be a bakery.  Why is the bread so dull tasting?  Why do the cookies taste like nothing more than preservative and artificial dyes?\n\nYeah, I'll keep going here for the coffee and a change of pace, but I'm not going to recommend it for anything beyond that."
2,"The food was good, our griller was nice, but did seem a little inexperienced. Our waitress was nice, but took forever when it came to refilling our drinks, getting our bill, and had even forgot to give my husbands card back so he had to go back the next day to retrieve it! As if that wasn't bad enough she dropped a fork in sauce when reaching to pack up our food and she splattered sauce all over my husband.\n\nWith us we had our two kids as well, and they thought the food was great, but later when we got home, we all got soooo sick, my poor daughter even had to stay home from school the next day. Had to throw out all our $20 an average plate food, what a waste!\n\nThen to top it off, the bathrooms! Both the men's and women's bathrooms were awful!!! I would have rather used a port-a-potty! I don't even want to go in to details they were that bad!!!\n\nThis was our second time there, the first was a decent experience, but this last experienced has left my family and I scarred!!! We are bummed because we love these types of grills, but we will not be returning to this specific one again."
2,"Meh...compared to Encore Beach, Wet Republic, or Marquee, this venue is lacking.  It was too packed and needs a bigger pool if they are going to admit that many people.  Not enough shady spots/umbrellas/trees or different little areas to get away from the main area if you need to.  Only one bar, and it took forever.  Went Memorial Day opening weekend and cabanas or daybeds were absolutely ridiculous in terms of cost (and not full).  And as with most things Vegas, everything was pretty ridiculous in terms of cost.  Lockers were $40 bucks for the day, waters were $10, big sports bottles of booze were $40.\n\nEven though I didn't like the venue itself, the crowd was fun and they bring in some pretty good DJs.  Make sure you get there on the early side so you can get in."
2,I love Jimmy Buffett but cant say I love the Margaritaville Cafe.  The food is ok but honestly not worth the price or the stupid long wait.   \n\nPositives:\nIt serves food.\nFun decorations downstairs and upstairs.\nConnects to the store that sells all sorts of Margaritaville stuff.\n\nNegatives:\nStupid crazy lines.\nFood is freakin expensive and isnt that good - very dumbed down for the masses.\nThe margaritas kinda suck - just seem really processed.\n\nHonestly I wouldn't go again but friends always want to give it a try.
2,"Hmmmm.... Went here on a Wednesday afternoon. The bakery seemed very friendly. I wanted to try some macarons because I've never tried them before. Please don't laugh, but I initially thought macarons was a cake sandwich with a consistency of a small little cake with icing in the middle. So I got the peach, vanilla almond, vanilla, raspberry, and the blue one( I forgot the name). I didn't like any of them. So as I bit down, they were kind of crunchy and soft but just too darn sweet. This kind of reminded me of a cookie. Some people may like them, but they just didn't agree with my taste buds. I will go here again but try something else!!!"
2,"Ate there with the wife last night. Everything tasted to us like it was straight out of a can and came to the table cold. Server was nice, but the everything home made speech is a crock. Just because it was put in a pot, then from a pot to a plate does not mean it should be called homemade or hand made."
2,"After reading the reviews I decided to stop by and I was a little disappointed, not as good as all the reviews suggested."
2,"I rarely walk into a Walmart, maybe once per quarter. This store is a mess! In fact it's so much of a mess that I wonder how people shop. A quiet Monday evening and there are carts full of merchandise around the store just sitting there. Went in looking for one particular product (a vacuum) and the sections were completely in shambles. A shame when you are looking at products that range from $38 to over $400. This reminds me of a bad bargain basement sale. It's like no one really cares and forget trying to find products on the shelves. Really... the competition has come to town and instead of competing you decide making your store look like trash is the way to go.... really!\n\nWalked to the cash to pay, light is on, but the cashier isn't even there. We stand there for a while deciding if we are going to pay for what we have in hand. Manager notices us and calls girl back to her cash. Four cashiers for the whole store and one goes walking away leaving people waiting? \n\nImportant Note: This Walmart has very limited handicapped parking and it is often impossible to find a spot. They just don't care enough to increase the spots, in spite of the fact that they are often full with cars that all have permits. Shameful."
2,"Saw this place walking on the strip and it looked really cool with the outdoor seating overlooking it. Also being from NY I know this place seems to be a hit. First we tried to be seated, and had to walk to the back of the restaurant and thru all the tables only to walk back to the front. A little strange but OK.  Our server was really nice and helpful while he was at our table but once he left it was hard to get his attention about something. I ordered a burger because i was indecisive about what to get, and figured it was hard to mess up. Boy was I wrong. Meat was almost inedible. My boyfriend also ordered a burger but double but it didn't come with a bun? So we had to pay extra for one? He was find with his but he eats anything so that doesn't say much. Needless to say I didn't eat my burger so naturally there was room for dessert. Deep fried Oreo sundae! OMG! I see why this place is known for their desserts, it was really good, very creative and decadent!  Could only eat about 25% between me and my boyfriend. I wouldn't go back to that specific location or maybe try the NYC location and just stick to the desserts."
2,I do not like Garcia's pizza very much! From the outside the place looks cute and very inviting but once you go inside you will think differently! The pizza is nothing to talk about and I would suggest going somewhere else!
2,"Okay, so I was craving a good burger.  So Got on Yelp as I so often do.  I found this place.  After reading the reviews I was sold. I mapquested and was on my way.  I agree with the comments about the inside of it but I know that sometimes the best foods comes from hole in the walls.  I ordered a double with chili and cheese combo.  Driving home I was excited.  Upon taking my first bite, I must say that my expectations far  exceeded the taste.  The chili was so bland...it just kind of coated my tongue.  I tried another bite and couldnt really distinguish that it was indeed chili that I was eating.  The burger itself was good...it reminded me of in and out burger.  I scraped the chili off added some salt.  And was still not impressed.  All in all it was a decent taste of beef and although I didn't like the chili at all...I would go back and just order a cheeseburger.  The fries were okay...they looked a bit like that had been sitting and then refried.  In and out are definitely better and you can tell that they are fresh,,,these not so sure!  Maybe this batch of chili wasn't up to par but it's a NO for me!  Now back to trying to eat the rest of this burger......."
2,"I am NOT a fan of Sweet Tomatoes. This location is always packed with soccer moms and their kids and I don't get why. The salad bar is fine but it's overpriced and has cheap ingredients. My biggest pet peeve is that even though the restaurant's name is Sweet Tomatoes, they don't even have sweet cherry tomatoes on their salad bar! What the heck? I know cherry tomatoes are pricey but c'mon, that's your namesake for crying out loud!\n\nThis place tries to lure you in by claiming to be \""healthy\"" but it's really carb central in disguise. While it's true you can eat reasonably well at the salad bar, the food bars are a different story. Bread, pizza, macaroni and cheese, pasta, sugar and starch laden soups, baked potatoes....not a lot of options for the healthy eater. How about adding some steamed vegetables or something? Although it's an all you can eat restaurant, I often leave here hungry because there's hardly any protein!\n\nThis place is overpriced and low quality. You can do better. And I don't know if it's some sort of additive they put on the salad bar but every single time I eat here, I get tummy troubles. No kidding."
2,"Style over substance. Ruben was an unmanageable mess, poutine had more fries than curds or gravy, no good beer on the menu. \n\nVegetarian options are pasta, pizza, or you can ask for a salad with no meat."
2,"the two stars are solely dedicated to the counter rental agent as he was kind and professional.  he explained everything with a smile and efficiency.  however, when we said no to all insurance and gas filling...note...car rental agents make commissions by selling these things. he told us there is a $20 surcharge on top of the original amount quoted.  this surcharge is a mandatory road side assistance surcharge... something no other car rental companies do.  as a result, we paid the same amount to payless for a very beat up compact when we could've rented from dollar or alamo for something better.  heading back to vegas in june for world serious but won't be renting from them ever again...\n\nTry e-z car rental 10 steps again.  They re soooo much better!!!"
2,"the bouganvilla restaurant was not so good. after ordering, our drinks appeared quickly. then things went down hill. our food took almost 45 minutes to arrive, and was disappointing. runny scrambled eggs were the main culprit. i enjoyed the sourdough toast and hashbrowns. the bacon was weird. he had a burger and fries ... the fries were awesome, but his burger was quite pink, despite being ordered \""medium\"". on our way out, we tried our luck at the wheel of fortune machine, where i dropped in $5 and walked out with $65, a miller lite (for him) and a vodka tonic. our winnings more than covered the cost of our middle-of-the-night meal.\n\na couple hours after my 2 am breakfast, i found myself worshipping a waste receptacle. i suspect the runny eggs were the cause. the only reason this place is getting 2 stars is the service. our server was, experienced, prompt and did all the right things at the right times. i liked her. i just wish she had the opportunity to serve a better product."
2,"Not very impressed with the Vietnamese sandwiches here at Lee's. Maybe its because the last time had one felt like they did things the right way. My first impression when I walked in was is this even a Vietnamese establishment. Not that one too judges book by its cover. Sure they had small section selling Vietnamese products from candies, dry goods products, baked goods, and beverages. It felt more like american chain sub or sandwich shop. \n\nI had the grilled pork sandwich or thit nuong. The same one last time had one but this was in Sacramento area. Not as though not close because my grilled pork sandwich had all the condiments that traditional. The spring of cilantro, sliced jalapeno, the carrots and believe daikon, and if there was anything they did hit on point was the bread. The bread was perfect hot, fresh, crispy outside, and great bread. They place they feel short for me. The grilled pork lacked flavor for me, portion size could have been bigger, the sauce or spread inside not fan of, and when combine everything together nothing Wow or get excited about. My dad who visiting order the combination sandwich. Not sure the types of meat in it but not fan more so then grilled pork sandwich. \n\nReally if looking too get Vietnamese sandwich not the pace too go. I know I was disappointed."
2,"I was NOT impressed with this place at all!  I LOVED fate and think Johnny is a great chef.....  I eat out everyday either lunch or dinner, the service was horrible, our server had an attitude.  The whole table (4) could feel her akwardness.  I understand the whole \""tapas\"" thing, but $100 dollar food check not including drinks is a bit much for us to leave hungry.  I dont think I would eat there again, drink? yes."
2,I've been to the Herbox many times in the past. On this visit I was disappointed in the menu.  The menu was blah not the same. The usual wait staff not present & friendly. This use to be one of my favorite places in Scottsdale not sure now. Hope things go back the old way.
2,"I was put off by the attitude I got at this place.  I didn't like how the guy taking my order belittled me for not ordering any appetizers or drinks.  I also don't like the handwritten signs that made excuses for why their service is slow and why they don't let non-patrons use their bathroom (a simple \""customers only\"" would work, but no, they have to go into great lengths to explain that toilet paper is expensive and therefore only their \""friends\"" -- the customers -- can use the toilets blah blah).\n\nThat aside, decor (minus the handwritten signs) is great.  I felt like I was at a noodle stand in southeast Asia.  I enjoyed my Cambod-Ican noodle soup (their take on pho).  I normally don't like pho because it tastes too much like MSG but it wasn't so bad here.  I tasted my friend's crispy noodles and thought it tasted like really sweet, low quality Chinese take out lo-mein (but at least the noodles were sufficiently crispy).  My other friend found her vegetable curry with chicken to be too spicy for her liking.\n\nThe whole payment system is awkward.  Why not just take payment when I order at the window?  Why do I have to awkwardly and deliberately put on my coat in full view of the window to signal them to come out and give me the check?  It's beyond me."
2,"The food was decent, and they have some crazy soda machine with like 1000 flavors (ok not really that many, but a frikn lot.)"
2,"I don't speak Spanish so I'm not sure that my girlfriend's translation of La Parilla Suiza to English as \""Our food tastes like when you throw up in the back of your mouth\"" is correct. We had some chicken enchiladas with green sauce on the recommendation of our server. Being a gringo I expect my enchilada to be a corn tortilla filled with some gooey melted cheese and if ordered with, some meat. These were corn torts with a dab of chicken inside them, topped with a green sauce that had no heat but a lot of twang. Though given the flavor of the enchiladas I was happy that there wasn't much there. \nAs for the service, we didn't see him again after the food was delivered until done and ready for the check. The carafe of water left on the table appeared to be a Star Trek collectible as it had food particle klingons. But hey, no server to complain to so I guess all is good."
2,"After first three visits within two months of this same visit, this would have been 5 stars but the last visit was very disappointing. Four of us all ordered 9 oz. medium rare filets that came out mostly brown without any red. I immediately told the waiter who was quick to agree to take it back to the kitchen. I saw the communication through the window and the cook's first question was, \""do they want it cooked more?\""  Really???  Waiter came back and told us 'it was the light' that made the steaks look more brown. Although it may have been a factor, the steaks were over cooked.  Waiter never said a thing again even though we twice mentioned the steaks were not cooked correctly. No offer to take anything off our bill and no apology if anything did not meet our expectations. As a former Wisconsin resident, and knowing the owners are also from there, this is not how Wisconsinites run a supper club!!  I can no longer recommend your business. Sorry."
2,"It's a Macaroni Grill... not much to say about this... if you have gone to one, you have seen them all. Nothing is really memorable. Including the service. Prices are reasonable."
2,"My first time here tonight. Service was good, the guy let me try some sauces and was helpful. The wings were ok, nothing to go out of the way for. They give you a lot of fries  but the food was cheap and they don't put much sauce on. It's on a college campus and it's surprisingly clean."
2,"There is nothing wrong with this place, but nothing particularly redeeming either.  The food was mediocre, and the interior didn't seem to fit the theme.  The servers seemed aloof.   We were there for the lunch buffet which had an ok selection of the Indian standards.  The best part was a never-ending basket of your choice of fresh baked Naan."
2,"Ok...  The name contains \""Urgent Care\"" which leads you to believe two things.\n\n1. Your care will be \""urgent\""\n\n2. This is a medical facility that treats minor emergencies and advanced illness.  I would expect them to bridge the gap between your regular doc and the ER.\n\nNeither 1 nor 2 are correct.  Even with the call ahead WAHOO service you still have to wait.  Even when the place is empty.\n\nAnd...  They only have Nurse Practitioners.  That's fine because they are in many cases better than doctors, but they are limited on what they can prescribe.  If you need something stronger (antibiotics in our case) rather than tell you that you need something they can't give you, they still give you a prescription for a weaker antibiotic and send you packing.\n\nSo I get less treatment than I get from my doc and I have to wait an eternity to get it.  Now remind me again why this is a good thing?"
2,"First time here today me and my husband, i don't like their Taiwanese traditional dishes and actually the price little higher compared with food quality."
2,"Tried this place for the first time.  The prices are reasonable however the food is sub par!  I ordered over easy eggs and got over medium to over hard eggs.  Not happy!!!  Pancakes take like dirty dish cloth!!  Yuck!!!  The bacon and hashbrowns were actually very good.  Customer service was average, nothing memorable.\n\nWon't be back!!!  Sorry, there are way too many breakfast places in the valley to choose from.  If you want to stand out, you have to do better than this.\n\nRecommend Peoria Cafe or Brothers instead!!!"
2,"This review is only about the nightclub, never ate here. The club is nice, the decor, the atmosphere is great, but...  the club is way too crowded and the music totally sucks... and totally OVER-RATED... who wants to dance to songs from 10 years ago? Well, okay they did play some Top 40/Hip Hip from 1-2 years ago. The two hours we waited in line didnt help the cause either. I'd say if you're from Iowa and this is the first time to Vegas, by all means check out the club, have a good time. If you've been to Vegas before and/or you've been clubbin in NY or LA or SF just skip the nightclub and just eat here!"
2,"Came for lunch on Saturday around 1:30 pm and the line was really long. Paid $37 plus tax per person, which came out to $41. There were nine of us so they sat us at a banquet like round table. Dishes were not as good as they looked, it is more about presentation here. Exotics dishes such as duck raviloi and tea eggs. Some of the dishes are served in little pans and are small portions. Best dish IMO was the beef brisquette with mashed potatoes. Best dessert IMO was the black forest cheesecake. The worst part was that they started turning off the lights and putting food away at 3:00 pm on the dot, even though the cashier did not indicate to us that this would happen."
2,"Had a gel polish change for my hands & feet, and I must say I was very disappointed. $40 for a gel polish change, NO pedicure. She cut my nails entirely TOOOO short & now my feet look like ugly french tipped nubs! I was going to get acrylics but since I didn't expect to pay so much for my feet I just got a gel manicure. It was OK, nothing special & it also $40 for that. Since I mentioned the discount from yelp they took $12 off my $80. I didn't feel she deserved any sort of tip but tipped her anyway... but I'll never come back."
2,"I don't do reviews, but after eating here I think I should write one to voice my complaints.\n\nI don't know what other people see in this place, for giving it such a good review (3 stars and up), but I found the place to be barely appetizing. People must have been drunk after clubbing or what not, but this place sucks for the price you pay. You're better off going to a buffet for what you're going to pay. \n\nI got a pesto shrimp spaghetti, which almost tasted like nothing. The shrimp was alright, but the noodles had no flavor. I'd be better off eating cardboard. I'm not sure what was in it, but taste was definitely not involved. \n\nOn a side note, calamari was good and service was par (like our tip.)"
2,"Been wanting to go here for a while. It was a little busy but got a nice table in the lounge where the band was setting up. Ordered some tacos. Carne asada and pork were just ok, the shrimp was decent. Overpriced beer ($17 pitchers) but were willing to pay that for the ambience. Unfortunately, it was hot as f*** in there. Oh, and when I ordered a bottle of Bud Light, I got a can!!! Going to America's Taco Shop next time for amazing carne asada!"
2,"Was at Surrender for MDW to see Calvin Harris, bought prepaid tickets which got us in fast, despite arriving at the scene at 11:30pm. After entering the club hassle-free, the excitement quickly dwindled. \nThe concept of having 80% of the club outdoor is nice, however the implementation was poor. Calvin Harris was playing at the indoor portion of the club, except no one was allowed on the dance floor except if you purchased a $3000 table. Why even let people in if you don't allow anyone on the dance floor? Waste of money on cover, and it wasn't like the cover was cheap either; $100 for guys and $40 for ladies. Go somewhere else to have a  good time."
2,"This is my second time here. I thought I'd give em another try. This visit really isn't different than my last one. I ordered a Green Chile cheeseburger. The waiter had to advise me it'll be hot. Lol ok whatever. So I finally get it. The presentation of the food looked half assed. Very sloppy. I take the top portion of bread off... There's hardly any green chile on it. I ask for a side of chile. It shows up. The green chile was hot. Which is good. It tasted straight out of the can tho. Gross. I'm sure they get Hatch food service cans or something. My girlfriends meal wasn't much better. She got The Green Chile Chicken Especial or something to that extent. The presentation of the food was horrid. It was a conglomeration of rice, beans, and cheese. With a little boat of chicken soupy something or other. She said that it was too salty. \n\nThe food isn't New Mexican. It's Tex Mex style food using Hatch Chile."
2,2 Stars because the restaurant decor was Awsome but unfortunatly we never got to eat here.  We ordered our food and 60 minutes later we still did not have our food.  We had to get up and leave.  I'd like to think that the food would have been good but now I'll never know.
2,"After doing some shopping nearby, I was lured into ATS by their slogan: \""Best Carne Asada in Phoenix\"".  When ordering at the counter, the staff seemed very disinterested in helping customers.  When I finally did order my carne asada burrito, I was given a number and asked to take a seat.  While I waited, I noticed a few other customers wondering what was going on with the bad service at the counter.  When my carne asada arrived at the table, I was starving.  However, the burrito that sat in front of me was tiny.  I'm not really one to complain about small portion sizes, as I feel that most portions are too big, but this portion was just comical.  The burrito was served with a lime wedge that was dry and looked like it had been sliced the day before.  The flavor of the carne asada was bland, as was the texture.\n\nOverall, this was a pretty disappointing meal.   \""Best Carne Asada in Phoenix\"" is a really misleading phrase to have on their sign.  This place is not even close."
2,"I thought that Lucille's BBQ in Las Vegas is much better.  Pot Liquor has big portions and big prices.  I had the Spare Ribs, which were good, but nothing amazing.  I thought that the portion was way too big for lunch and wish that they had some lunch options\n\nThe service was \""OK.\""  It was a typical \""What do you recommend?\"" \""Oh, everything is good\"" service. If you come to Pot Liquor, just don't come with high expectations."
2,"Two stars for being the worst of the three that I've been to.\n\nThe usual SS staples are there, and the food isn't bad, but they ditched the Calimari that is on the Chicago menu!  Unbelieveable.  That was the most delicious thing I had ever had!\n\nMostly, my beef with this place is the location, in a mall, and the ambience of the place.  The ironic part is that when you are dining at the Chicago or Miami locations, it feels like you are in Vegas: swanky, cool, fun.  But dining in the Vegas one feels like you are at a Legal Seafoods in suburbia.\n\nJust misses something.  If you're in Vegas, go someplace else."
2,While the food isn't bad; it's just not worth the price. It calls to mind an Olive Garden or Red Lobster with a few more bells and whistles. 5 stars for great service.
2,"Yuck! It's vegas and I wanted an eiffel tower drink but never again! I'll stick with Fat Tuesday. But if you want to get drunk within minutes, this drink definitely does the trick.\n\nThe drink itself is disgusting. I got the strawberry daquiri b/c I didn't want any tequila. But I mean the drink got me drunk within minutes but I felt like shit. Plus, it costs $16.99 for it. I almost would have rather paid for the eiffel tower and had Fat Tuesday filled it up instead. At least their alcohol doesn't get me feeling extremely shitty for the next two hours. Also, the alcohol wasn't even proportionally mixed in. The dude basically pour alcohol at the bottom of the cup and then filled the rest of the tower up with strawberry daiquiri. I ended up pouring the last 1/4 of my drink. I couldn't drink anymore of it.\n\nPass.\n\nCome here if you want the cup. For the alcohol? go to fat tuesdays."
2,"This theater is just frustrating to me which is why I rarely come here and would rather go to other theaters that are off the strip. First of all, this place is not easy to find and I probably would not have found it the first time I came here if it wasn't for the sign pointing me to the alley way. Then, when I did find it and went inside after purchasing my ticket, I was confused at the concession stand. Why is the popcorn in the display counter and the popper and it's not warm like other places. Don't get me wrong, the popcorn is okay, but I've had better, so it was just a disappointment. I didn't notice the place being overtly dirty, but it just didn't feel clean. The seats in the actual theater room were old, small, and uncomfortable! The place definitely needs an update. I was the only person seeing the movie I went to, and I felt kind of weird being alone in there which is not something I've ever felt at other theaters. I'd definitely rather go to a different movie theater than this one which is why I haven't been here in a while."
2,"Very nice hotel. Beautiful, large and clean rooms. However, customer service was not so great. Overall, the place just felt stuffy and staff was not very friendly. Upon checkout the girl at the desk didn't even bother to ask us how are stay was or thank us for staying there. She just said hello and then handed us our bill. I am fairly easy to please, but when I'm paying for a hotel like this I expect you to at least pretend you appreciate my patronage."
2,"Me and my boyfriend were visiting Fremont street and got hungry.  We had been spending ridiculous amount of money on strip food so this place seemed like a real bargain.  I kinda liked the decor.  It was an 80's jungle theme.  Our server was very nice and attentive. Most of the food was not very good.  I got quite a few items that I only took 1 or 2 bites of. I think it's funny that they advertised it was a steak dinner buffet and what they served was thin strips of  carne asada.  It was still yummy though.  Just not what I picture when I think of steak.  To get full I had to make 10 trips to the carving station, they are very stingy with the meat. Bottom line- I didn't get sick, I got full and it was really cheap. Would I go back? No."
2,Incredibly slow service in the mornings.  I've stood in line for 15 minutes just to order one cup of coffee when there were only 2 other people in line.  They are all very friendly but their multi-tasking abilities are extremely poor.  Not a good combination in that line of business.
2,My sandwich took 30 minutes for me to get. Really?? A sandwich?? Its worth a shot to try this spot. Alot of my friends like this place but not me. Too loud too have a conversation with someone sitting right next to you. The waitress took our order..brought out the food..gave us the check. . And not once asked if we needed anything. No refills. No more alcohol.  Napkins. Nothing.   Rude..I hate bad service.  If you dont want to wait on people then why are you here.  The only reason I gave 2 stars is because they have soooo many tvs.  And every sport on.
2,"The word \""Premium\"" shouldn't be used here.  This place is outdated and I really think the selection of stores are boring.  The good news, especially in the summer time is that you have an indoor mall, unlike the North Outlets which has a much better selection of stores, but all outside.  Unless they put some more interesting stores in here, I think I will continue to bypass it."
2,"Below average, overpriced, unwelcoming.\n\nI have been meaning to try this place since it opened. My boyfriend is from North Carolina and loves BBQ so I've been trying to find him a place in Pittsburgh he might enjoy. We got takeout - brisket sandwich, 1/4 fried chicken, meaty Mac, and coleslaw. We found everything to be underwhelming. The brisket was average- it was tender but I've had better.  The fried chicken was salty.  The meaty Mac would have been better without the blue cheese.  I ate it by picking out meat chunks and the crispy cheese on top. The coleslaw was good, and by far our favorite part of the meal. That should say enough. \n\nPrice was $35 for all of the above. \n\nAs far as service, the waitress seemed uninterested in us. There were only three other guests in the downstairs of the restaurant."
2,"Pros: Gym is close to my home and is in a nice area. Lots of cardio equipment, treadmills, etc. CONS: Trainers will interupt you during your workouts trying to get you to sign up with them. They also call A LOT....got two phone calls yesterday alone from two different trainers. Gonna cancel my membership tomorrow."
2,"My wife and I just finished lunch here and let me tell you, man-oh-man, we were disappointed.\n\nWe have eaten numerous times at the Carson Street Cafe (all the way back to when Steve Wynn still owned the place), and we have always enjoyed ourselves.  But today, it was just bad, and I give it 2 stars since I have experienced better at this cafe.\n\nThe service was really slow, the waiter didn't seem to give a rat's arse about us or the food or service and our food was just plain yucky.\n\nI had the most bland and tasteless Cobb salad I have ever had and my wife had the Oxtail Stew.  She enjoyed her food more than I liked mine.\n\nBut our major complaint was about the service.  This place in the past always gave us good to excellent service, but today was a really different story.\n\nI am concerned that now that this is a Landry's that it's going to be just another high priced \""Denny's\"" kind of joint.  If so, that would be sad.  It used to be distinct and decent.\n\nIt's a sad day for me to have experienced this let down, since I have always liked the Golden Nugget.  Sad!"
2,"A big WHA WHA!\n\nDidn't wait long because I was with a group of 6 girls but then found it was a $20 cover.  Since it was late, we decided to screw it, but as we were walking out, got handed free passes, so we turned around and went back in.\n\nAwesome interior, but the point of a nightclub is to dance. You can't dance if you're wedged up against 600 other sweaty, wasted people. I don't care how good you look coming in, you're gonna look nasty if you're sweaty and wasted regardless.\n\nI can imagine if you're really tore up however, it might be a strategic move to shove your way in to the middle of the crowd, since it's virtually impossible to fall down with all those people holding you up.\n\nAlso, those girls in the pools are really depressing. When nice girls say hello and ask you how you're doing and you stare blankly ahead and strike a pose from a foot away, you look like you've been trafficked. Either that or you just have to get wasted to make it through your shift."
2,"Luckily I don't mind Coke....  I have been here several times and it's been... \""meh\""... but the last time I came through the drive thru and ordered a simple Medium #1 with onion rings.  I thought it was strange that the order taker did not ask what I wanted to drink, but just drove around (figured he would ask me when I got there).... NOPE just handed me a coke.  I try to roll with the punches more-often-than-not, but this was not the end of the world for me.  When I opened the bag, I had fries... and mentioned it to him.  There was no apology and he just went and got the onion rings and handed me the bag back.\n\nI guess  the phrase, \""you get what you pay for\"" applies here.  I will probably give this place another shot since it's right near my house when I need a BK fix, but this is very disappointing in my book."
2,"Enjoyed the Pimms but that's where the enjoyment stopped.  The food was bland and service was nothing spectacular. On a later date, I had high tea there. Scones were good but the little sandwiches tasted stale and the salmon in them tasted like it was out of a package."
2,It seems like everyone had a better experience here than me. Maybe I just went on a bad day.  My biggest gripe about this place is that the veggies didn't look good. I had to pick through the carrots and tomatoes to find ones that looked relatively fresh. The sweet and sour sauce was kind of bland. Service was good though. Our server was friendly and checked on us regularly. Maybe I'll have better luck next time.
2,"I went here with my fianc\u00e9 and we both ordered the steak omelet. His came out filled with steak and all the goodness it comes with, mine came out with literally 3 pieces of steak. When I questioned them about it they has 2 managers come tell me that the steak is all pre-weighed and that is what it comes with. I pointed out my finances plate vs mine and stated that if I'm paying the price for the steak then I want steak! They ended up bringing me a side of stake bits after about 20 min and were very rude. I will not go back there!"
2,Went on a week day for dinner. Service was so so and so was the food. Nothing to really brag about. Place is old and had a funky smell when you walk inside. I would say this is more a local watering hole then a restaurant.  There are better places to go then here for Oysters and other food.
2,"I seriously don't understand the five star reviews. My food was about as bland as it gets. Its Vietnamese...the spices and herbs they normally use add terrific flavor. My meal here had none. Now, Jeff's on the other hand tasted like they dumped an entire shaker of salt on it. Ummmm, salt on Vietnamese?? Anyway, I'm here for the weekend and its the closest vegan joint, so I'll likely be back. I'll order the spring rolls...those, I liked. Sorry, but Vegas and vegans are not a good mix!"
2,"Salads/Sandwich's are decent/Good, Desserts are what makes them stand-out. The wait during rush hour (lunch) is a joke. Feel's like a grade school cafeteria line. Guys/Gals with there briefcases who need too much room and think there overly important. And the best part you ask? The parking lot is a cluster, And with this location being so busy you think Paradise would come to there senses and move to a more suitable/larger building. Also, only two stars because price wise should be cheaper IMO"
2,Close by grocery store ... Open 24 hrs - but count on it ... If you have a need for something specific - there's a good chance they will be out of it or have discontinued carrying it ... This place is not dependable for the real groceries... Go to Harris Teeter or Trader Joes for that ... This is good for creamer or milk or eggs ... Maybe ...  Also watch the cashiers - famous for over charges and not giving credit for coupons even after they're mentioned to them ... Most definitely pay attention to your charges !
2,"I've been here a countless amount of times. I had been wanting Pei Wei for about two weeks. Finally decided\nTo go and get lettuce wraps and one spring roll. Quick as always but wraps just didn't taste right. They had an \""aftertaste\"" not a good one either. Spring roll was okay. Could taste the go ginger and the seaweed was too chewy. Very disappointed and am in no hurry to run back."
2,"I came this past weekend for a quick dinner there was hardly anyone in the restaurant , and it took us 20 mins to be seated and the hostess was very rude. The food was good but they need to work on there customer service ."
2,"This restaurant was far from great. With a price of $17+ for pasta I expected great. I had the Gorgonzola chicken pasta and I expected a deliciously rich and creamy pasta. Instead I could only describe this as tasting like pasta from a cafeteria. So disappointing. \n\nThey were kid friendly, which was helpful. They had good bread and we had a pretty decent clam appetizer. My hubby had some tasty prime rib as well.\n\nThey took care of the pasta which I appreciated. Overall, they were friendly and accommodating but the food just wasn't  worth the price."
2,"Good French food, average service\n\nStopped into Mon Ami Gabi on a vacation to Vegas.  My wife and I thought it was superb 11 years ago and were happy to see they are still in business.  We both recalled how much we loved their French Onion Soup.\n\nWith some relatives coming down the street, I was disappointed by the young lady managing the hostess desk.  She wouldn't even say if or how long our wait was, \""Unless your full party is here.\""  I could understand not being seated, but the rude tone and nonsensical retort that they can't even give you an estimate on wait time got things off to a poor start.  Then, we were seated immediately when our family members arrived.\n\nThe menu is simple enough and the food was good, but not great.  Salads were unremarkable.  The Fillet Mignon was very good.  And the final bill was about $205 for four adults, a toddler, and a baby.  Note: They put 18% gratuity on for themselves.\n\nThere were much better years ago.  And if there were better service, I would readily give them three stars."
2,everytime i come here for a haircut they mess it up. a good haircut is suppose to last 15 to 25 minutes this place has you in and out in 5 minutes. never coming back
2,"Got the Shrimp wonton w/ramen noodle. The portion was very good but, the soup has absolutely no flavor.  Disappointed as all the reviews said it was great."
2,"I usually wait to review a restaurant until I have visited at least two, if not three times. The major exception to this rule is if I don't plan to visit again.\n\nI gave them two instead of one star because I had been suffering from stomach flu for a week, and mistakenly chose this restaurant to break my fast. What I'm saying is that they might have good stuff, but I won't be going back to find out.\n\nI ordered the five tacos, a good deal at $4.95 I think. Unfortunately, they were deep fried taquitos, not traditional Mexican tacos. I liked the cheese, guac, and lettuce that was piled high, but unfortunately I didn't like what it was piled on top of."
2,"Five guys, you are still letting me down. You are nowhere near as good as you were in VA. I gave you another try tonight and all I can say is WHERE'S THE BEEF? Your patties are so thin and it appears that the only way I will actually be able to taste the burger on the bun is if I order a regular cheeseburger which consist of two patties. I should be able to order a little cheeseburger and still be able to taste the actual burger. I will wait another six months or so to give you one final try here in Arizona before I give up on you all together. Sad, just sad!\n\nPS Your fries are still pretty good and the service was great but your burgers here in Arizona really do leave something to be desired ."
2,"Great selection for a wide range of fabric/upholstery needs. Some items are well priced and others, outrageous. Two star rating is for the service there.....EVERY time I go there I am treated as if I am a ghost!!! They have a \""take a number\"" system that even THEY don't really use. LOTS of people working there but ALL seem to have another agenda that doesn't include the CUSTOMERS! \nReally should give one star for service but product selection gets them Two!"
2,"Went in for breakfast. We were sat pretty quickly but no one came to our table for about 10 minutes. Apparently no one was sure who's section we were in. The food was ok, definitely nothing to get excited about. I had to ask for a glass of water 4 times before they brought it. \nWe have had a decent dinner there before and may go back for that sometime but for breakfast there are much better places in town."
2,"It was our first night/ day in Vegas. Kinda hard to tell what time of day it was. We were hungry, dazed, and delirious. \nNot sure how we got here. It was cheap, filling, a lot of selection, and crying to be updated inside. \nIf you lose all your cash on the slots, come here and eat cheap. I think it was like $8.00 pp."
2,"I had what I thought was a great facial and after two days, I experienced a reaction to their products.  I purchased a few of the items during my visit so I called to let them know of what happened.  The girl in the spa said she would have to check to see if I could return the skin care products that I purchased for $85.00. After asking me again why I was returning them, she said \""they would allow me\"" to return them but they would have to issue a check instead of crediting my credit card that they so easily accepted when I purchased the items.  I returned to the spa the following day with the items and they gave me a credit voucher and said they would check with the manager to make sure he would approve the return.  I received a call 4 days later letting me know he did in deed \""approved it\"" and they would put a check in the mail...which I still have not received.  No one was concerned that I just spent $160 on a facial spa treatment and my face was all chapped, peeling and red from the reaction.  All they were concerned with was whether they would allow me to return items that I clearly couldn't use.  I was a returning guest but after this incident, I will no longer be a patron of the Arizona Grand Spa.  Apparently they've changed management and the customer no longer comes first."
2,"I finally got to this place. The people who took me there raved about the place and are regulars.  Very interesting building-check it out if you go. Nice crowd but not to busy.  Interesting menu. Food was good but nothing exceptional.  The most noticeable thing about eating there was the complete lack of enthusiasm/interest on our server's part.  I thought being on a college campus, the person serving us might been upbeat and cheerful?  Not so. Even when I asked for a take out box, the server sat it down by my plate and walked off without a word.  \n\nMaybe if I'd had more than a few beers, I'd have appreciated this place more. There is a real variety of places to go to in Tempe so why go back.  Going back to Four Peaks kind of reminds me of the old expression-buy me another drink,  your still ugly.  The server wasn't buying."
2,"Meh, lola lo is just ok. Had a few fun nights here. This is a simple list of what they get right & what they get wrong:\nGood - bar staff are very friendly & helpful, yummy cocktails, bouncers are surprisingly nice, decoration is beautiful (I know beach theme can look tacky but they pull it off quite well), people there are pretty down to earth for G.street.\nBad - very expensive,... \u00a34.50 vod/mixer rising to about \u00a37 for any cocktail, cover charge is too expensive like other poster said, music is far too quiet & last time I went music was a bit crap, dance floor is too small for this to really be a club its more like a bar with dance area, doesn't usually fill up till quite late on in the evening.\nBasically I wouldn't really choose to go here, but if everyone else had already made up their mind I would tag along."
2,"First clue was no one in restaurant. Dinner rolls were burnt and Chicken Parmesan was overcooked. Out of 4 of us at the table ... No one liked their dinner. One friend who is vegan asked for plain noodles with veggies. They accommodated, but then topped it with cheese (not vegan). #fail"
2,I've been coming here my whole life (23 years). It used to be my favorite place to go.  Nothing better then a chili cheese dog. Over the years it has changed. Its now a over priced fast food place. Lost its character and charm. If I wanted to spend $5 on a hotdog I could go to the pirate game.
2,"The atmosphere on the patio is nice with the fountains but it isn't nice having dinner to the smell of chlorine.  The food was ok and the server had no problem honoring the yelp complimentary chips and salsa.  We each got the green chili chicken burrito.  The food was laden with cheese and not for the cholesterol conscious.  It was hard to taste much besides the cheese and the spice but, there was chicken in there too.  If it weren't for the patio/water feature, I don't think this place would be in business."
2,"This Westin has slipped. We always stay there for Furniture Market because the parking is free and very abundant. It also has the Heavenly beds which I love and a Starbucks in the lobby. Yeah! But something has changed and service has slipped. I'm not sure we will stay there again despite the fact that we are Starwood preferred members. \n\nMy room had very spotty air conditioning which was important since it was 107 degrees. So I called down to get someone to come fix it...yada yada yada...he comes...says he's fixed it. Temp doesn't change. Finally fall asleep exhausted from the day...hot and sweaty in the not-so-heavenly bed. Then the next day their solution is to move me....I don't want to move all my unpacked stuff to another floor from my colleagues one day away from leaving. She sends guy again. This time he discovers that he's left a critical part off the air co causing the air not to flow. Then it works wonderfully. Other issues...floor not swept or vaccuumed any day we were there. Trash left out in room....not \""subject to interpretation\"" trash but things like crumpled paper and little creamer carton from the very very weak starbucks in room coffee. \n\nAnyways....nothing was tragic...life is too short to get too worked up...but it does seem that there has been a dramatic shift since in the past it has been such a nice experience."
2,"Ate late last night - We were the only ones there at about 8pm on a saturday night. The food was okay, but nothing out of this world. I was impressed that they had saba and a few others ready to go, but I think that I would only return when it is busy because I can't see how the rolls could have been fresh. It's not bad if you order and have them prepare it on the fly, but at a Kaiten sushi joint you don't expect that you have to. It is slightly hard to find (behind a few rows of buildings actually!) and signage is minimal until you reach the area (3 parking lot areas deep!)  Maybe that is why it was empty.  It is really clean, and nicely decorated inside and the staff is friendly and attentive."
2,"While I'm not from Chicago, I did live there 6 months. Long enough to know good pizza! I ordered a small pizza and a corn dog from them. Points for having corn dogs, it was a yummy defrosted corn dog.. no complaints there. My fiance was very happy to have a corn dog with his pizza (yes I'm marrying someone that likes to have a corn dog and pizza for dinner, but that's another issue). \n\nThe pizza .. now that was the problem. It sucked! So to explain Chicago pizza.. it should be thin-ish on the bottom, but thick on the sides and top.. sort of like a pie. Yes, a pie. The pizza should when sliced, look like a thick piece of pie. My pizza was about half an inch tall. Maybe just the 9 inch comes out tiny, but seriously I had 10 inch pies in chicago frequently that came out awesome. This one was very similar to those nasty frozen pizzas from pizza hut you buy at the airport. A complete disappointment. We had one slice and threw it away.. \n\nIf you like Giordannos, or Lou Malnati's, or REAL delicious chicago pizza you will be sorely disappointed by this crap."
2,"Prices jacked up since my visit 7 months ago. 21$ for Meatball Burger and Fries.  $23 for Goat Cheese Caesar with Chicken.  21$ Chinese Chicken Salad. $9 for Side of Fries. Really? Nice looking place, some of the food is real good.  But at these prices, i do not see long term success.  And i thought the $16 Club Sandwich w/ Fries when this space was Augutus Cafe was a rip....I went to Mon Ami Gabi and got a great steak and fries in a wonderful outdoor table for $25.  Gimme a break"
2,"Third time trying this place. Each time I was a bit disappointed, but I kept trying because it's so close to my home. Last time they got my order wrong and I didn't really care too much,  but today they got my order wrong and forgot some of my food. I am not driving back to get my food, I'm giving up on this place."
2,"So disappointing- after reading some positive reviews I was anxious to give them a try. From ice cold, mushy Mexican corn- to cold, strangely seasoned chicken tacos.\nOne redeeming item was my husbands cheeseburger. It was hot and the burger itself was juicy. We ate the burger and threw away the rest."
2,"Our first visit was not the best experience..it was just \""ok\"" at best.....nothing special.    The person at the register who took our order didn't know much about the menu...and we didn't get what we ordered (had asked for deep fried and got a sauteed conglomeration instead).  The flavor was good ... but didn't like sauteed eggplant with very tough skin.   I can't say the service was terribly bad or rude...but we didn't feel welcomed or appreciated.   Never got a greeting or smile when we walked in and  never heard the words \""thank you.\""   It was almost as if everyone working there lacked reasonable enthusiasm.   We'll probably give it one more try.  Maybe I am 'old school' but I think no business should treat their customers in such a nonchalant way.  That typeof attitude can make the difference between a one-time customer or a repeat customer.  BTW, the guy with glasses (maybe the owner or manager??)  seemed to annoyed when we asked about menu items... somewhat of a jerk."
2,"This was my first time here. I called our order in and I was told 20 mins!  Perfect, that would be my lunch break from work.  I headed over there and the guy said it would be just a couple more minutes.  About 10 minutes later he said he just needed to make the shakes.  10 MORE minutes later he finally did! Overall it took about 45 minutes to get our food and at this point I was already over on my break!   The \""frozen custard\"" shake was the reason I ordered it... no frozen custard  used, it was the discount tub of ice cream!  I could have skipped it for something 'normal'   Over all the food was ok... a bit greasy for my taste.  I don't think I would bother going back there for the time and cost of the meal."
2,"$10 for a medium drink, chicken sandwich, and a small salad = MEH! Overpriced and nothing special of this BBQ chicken sandwich.\n\nI'll go back for a second try, someday..."
2,"Great Ambiance, Great view, Great Wait staff,  rib eye not so much. Not what I was expecting when you're paying  Ruth Criss/Flemings prices. The steak would fit nicely at Black Angus or Outback."
2,"Hit Mac's for the 3rd time since moving to CLT 3 years ago.  I finally had to write.\n\nIn my opinion OVERATED.\n\nI had the brisket the first two times and was very disappointed both times.  Tough, chewy, and not much of it.  Yet this is the place that supposedly has the best brisket in town.  Sides: Meh.\n\nThis trip I went with the pulled pork thinking it would be a safe bet.  Just so-so.  I have had better in town many times.\n\nSo why even give them 2 stars?\n\nThis is a FUN place!  Cool atmosphere, great beer list, good service, music just right, etc.  Will I go back?  Probably if I'm going to be in the area.  But definitely not a spot I will go out of my way for."
2,"To be honest the food was a 4 but the service was really bad, as in 1 star. Our sever was actually really nice and did a good job. The kitchen couldn't seem to get anything right. I'll save you the details but we got our food 30 min after we ordered.  On top of that it came out spread over the next 15 min. The place has severe management issues. Somone needs to show them how to run a restaurant with some efficiency. Luckily I don't live in phx so this won't be an issue for me again."
2,Not sure why I went outta my way for this place. Seemed good when we first walked in. Then the mashed potatoes were cold and the meat wasn't that great. The sweet tea and the Corn bread were great but that was about it. I wouldn't go back. Best bbq in the west my ass.
2,"Dining-in: it's crowded, loud, and the service is awful. I get that the pizzas take a while, but that doesn't mean that everything else should, too. I've never had a polite interaction with the staff here (nothing outrageous, but for a Champaign \""staple\"", one might think that the staff would be a little more gung-ho about being such an attraction to visitors... yes, you, I saw your roll your eyes at me when I changed my order mid sentence. Rude!).\n\nOrdering-in: A good experience because I can avoid the cramped seating and the impolite staff. Deep dish holds well as a reheat option the next day. Their sausage pizza is really delicious.\n\nOne plus: I have friends in Chicagoland who love this pizza and if we're in Champaign for a visit, we bring back Papa Dels. It travels well.\n\nOverall: If you're in Champaign, yes, it's the best deep dish there is. If you're from anywhere else, you can do better."
2,"Bay City Diner... I miss you. \n\nDu Pars is decent food ok but grossly overpriced for breakfast. Two friends and I had breakfast there. Simple fare... Pancakes, eggs, bacon, toast.glass of OJ or coffee.  Total tab for 3 of us over $50. Seriously.\n\nAlso have eaten dinner there and it is also overpriced. I mean come on... This is a diner for crying out loud. On Fremont Street. Not the strip. \n\nBay City used to be a great deal for good food but Du Pars is a disappointment."
2,"ugggh , i can't even bare to read aLL the good feedback this restaurant got . 2 stars is being EXTREMELY generous . when i Lived in Vegas years ago , my famiLy & i used to ALWAYS go here & it was thee Biz . i recentLy went here the first week of january when i was visiting & it was pathetic . food was bLand , service was whomp whomp , they have NO chicken katsu , & they ONLY accept cash . Like seriousLy , it's 2011 ... get with the program . as much as i LOVED this pLace when i was younger , i don't think i couLd ever bring myseLf to go here again . if you guys want good hawaiian/isLand food in the mainLand , come to the REAL state of CaLifornia & i'LL be gLad to recommend a handfuL of great pLaces . i was Looking forward to going to this pLace when we got to vegas , & it was such a bummer that it was faiL ."
2,I give the star to the employees only but SAMs sucks when it comes to clothing for larger people same with walmart sorry but we are a larger nation and big people need cloths too I believe the also discriminate against larger people when they charge more and don't carry sizes that fit most large people. Get on the band wagon and treat us big people equal!!!!
2,"The service was great but the food was not. All the pasta for our party was undercooked; there were 14 of us. Other customers also were returning meals. The manager told us they were using a new pasta and had to \""learn to cook it\"". She did make an adjustment on our bill to make up for the bad meals."
2,"Large room, ok bed, worn out sofa.  Lousy shower.I booked the room because it was a good price and Expedia rated it as ****. Not four star hotel. The food at the hotel was lousy, won't return to the Rio"
2,"Is this place one of the few inexpensive buffet spots on the strip? Yes. Is the food comparable to other buffets on the strip? No. Why? Well, everything my wife and I had during the breakfast buffet was bland, dry and cold. \n\nThe selection here is very limited compared to other breakfast buffets we've attended. So if you're looking for a place that has an overwhelming number of options ready for you to dive into, let me save you the time and tell you look elsewhere. Yes, other buffets can be pricey, but at least at those buffets the food quality is far better and you have a bigger selection of items to choose from.\n\nThe only real benefits of coming to this buffet is saving a few extra bucks."
2,"The building and view are beautidul....and that's the only reason why I gave it two stars. The waitress had limited knowledge on fine dining cuisine, the calimari was over cooked so we told the waitress, she returned it to the kitchen and came back out asking if we wanted something else and declines to remake the dish stating \""that's just how they make it. they won't make the dish again because that's how they cook it and it will come out the same way.\"" My father asked for fresh lime in his beverage and the waitress said she'll have to check and see if they have any limes, that they didn't have many in stock. The young man filling our water and butter on the table was smacking gum so loud you could hear it across Pittsburgh. He also refilled our table water by reaching over us, so instead of pulling the water glass off the table and pouring it properly he poured the water with the glass directly ont to the table resulting in spilling ice cubes.  I had chucks of solid cheese in my pasta that wasn't melted, missing tomatoes, my dad's escargot was over cooked, my boyfriends steak was flavorful but a poor cut of meat & they ran out of half of their dessert options. Overall they are just stuck in the 1970's with their black tie outfits and old school menu. Save your money, enjoy the view from the overlook and find another restaurant with better quality."
2,"If my mother ever cooked like this I would have fired her. \""My Mother's\"" is bland as I am white. I had bland Lasagna with hard spice-less garlic bread and a limp side salad. The only item that saved My Mother's was the pie. The Chocolate Cream Pie (pictured) was heaven. The contrast between dinner and desert made me wonder if My Mother had someone else bake the pie."
2,"Had the spinach appetizer. It was okay,. It didn't have much flavor & was more of a soup consistency than a dip. Prices are high and menu appears to be trying to be high end, which is weird when the bus' name is on the door. Actually walked to the restaurant from the Hyatt Place hotel specifically to watch the Rangers game and grab a bite to eat unfortunately after five minutes was not able to get the waitresses to identify which TV could be change to the game. As it was the bottom of the eighth inning I chose just to watch the ending via the mlb app I have on my phone."
2,"Nick's has been a pretty popular gathering place for a group of my friends. I have had their pizzas, calzones,  and chicken parmesan. Those dishes have been pretty good. \n\nLast night I wanted to try something new, so I tried the baked ziti with meatballs. I don't recommend it. The issue was that it was overcooked. The ziti was rubbery and the dish was dry. The ends of the ziti were hard and crunchy. The best thing about the dish was the meatballs. \n\nEven though my food was not up to par, the service was exceptionally good."
2,The meat dishes like lamb kebab & chicken 65 we're not that great. \nPaneer tikka masala. Plenty of gravy but only 8 cubes paneer. Chana masala was ok. Naan was fresh & soft.
2,"Not really impressed with the food or wine list. The idea of the ipad for wine list is crazy!   You can't look for it he right wine and the options are very limited. It should not be called a wine bar since there is nothing special about the wine they carry. \n\nWe ordered the seared tuna, green beans, flatbread and the battered shrimp. The tuna and green beans were pretty decent but the rest of the food was just below average. I do like the comparison from other teloera saying that it is very comparable to an overpriced Applebee's with wine. \n\nI also noticed that the menu has not changed in over three years. The desserts are also terrible!"
2,"Creeps were good.  Coffee and Orange Juice excellent.  Service pretty poor, slow even when only two tables taken.  Also somewhat $$ considering."
2,"Service and seating at this show is horrendous and out of control. We had tickets for a certain section on the main floor and when we arrived there were no seats in that row. The people sitting in our row told us that the ticketing system went down and that duplicate tickets had been printed, so we had to go see an usher to be seated...WTF! Already not off to a good start! We finally tracked down an usher that put us across the auditorium between a bunch of families.\n\nThe show itself wasn't any better than the seating process...I can see how this show is made for children because it's so random and scripted that it was hilarious and we probably spent a good 3/4 of the show laughing our butts off. I kind of felt bad for the people that were seated around us! During the show, a bunch of pandas dance around the stage while martial arts and acrobatics are being performed. \n\nI'm not sure if there is supposed to be a story to this show...I really couldn't tell and right from the beginning I was confused on what was supposed to be happening. My favorite part though was when the guy was beating the crap out of one of the pandas and whipping him haha. This is definitely a random show and not worth paying any amount of money to see. I would only recommend going if you get free tickets or have some kind of super discounted deal..."
2,"the whole idea of applebee's really bothers me. chain restuarants that you can go to all over the country just seem weird. it seems so much more worth it to try something new and unique and risk it not being great than going somewhere that introduced that obnoxious song about   baby back ribs... oh wait, that was chiles. well, i feel the same way about that restaurant too.\n\nthe only times i came here were to do their happy hour, which is pretty good, if you can stand the atmosphere. the HH hours are pretty impressive; 3 to 7 and 10 to midnight every night of the week. other than that - gross, gross, gross"
2,"I would have loved to rate this hair salon higher, but in the midst of my search for a quality salon in Phoenix, this does not rate on my list of favorites.  The guy who cut and highlighted my hair was very friendly, however, my highlights looked disastrous.  I asked for a natural look and I got areas that were bleached out, orange, light brown, and some blonde.  I would not return there, even to get my hair fixed, in fact, I went somewhere else to get my color corrected, which I wish would not have had to happen because now my hair is damaged.  Overall, I would rate the salon higher if my color service were better, but the place was clean and the staff were friendly enough."
2,Sushi was just ok. Service was horrible. So slow!! They took my order to a wrong table and didn't apologize. Took them 25 min from they say we will take your dessert order until we can flag them (they don't even bother to check on us again). Don't want to go here again.
2,Z Pizza you are nothing special.\n\nRubbery salty crust.  Your whole pizza is merely so so and your slices border on abysmal.  Staff didn't seem to care if I was there or not.  The owner was there and that was more important than my late lunch order.\n\nOk you're organic.  Guess what?  I don't care.  When I want pizza I don't want to feel like I am making a healthy compromise.  I only want something tasty and unhealthy.  That's why I'm eating pizza instead of a salad.  \n\nOk you have gluten free options.  The only thing sadder than that is a fat kid with no money staring at a bakery counter.  \n\nI don't buy your hype.  Your food is so so at best.  I will continue to order elsewhere.
2,"One thing is for sure, you know what you're getting when you order Domino's Pizza.  I wouldn't say it's the best pizza by any stretch, but you know all that going into it.  I mean when you're a stranger in a very strange land, sometimes you just call the number on your hotel room swipe card!!\n\nDominos is kinda the fast-food of pizza... a bit salty, but then you knew that..."
2,"Chompies, I wanted to love you, but you missed the mark. I grew up surrounded by Jewish delis, and had been sincerely missing that being in Arizona. They have classic Jewish favorites and the matzo ball soup, and bagels were hits for our group. However, the quality of food and the service were not consistent throughout the meal. We had to ask multiple times for the complimentary pickles to be delivered to the table, and they arrived as we were finishing out meal. The dish I ordered, someone in the kitchen decided to add bacon to, which very much upset this vegetarian. I was offered another meal, but when I didn't particularly trust anything coming from the kitchen at that point. The meal was comped, which was appreciated, but it didn't change the fact that I was extremely let down by a meal that I was looking forward to. At this point, I have no desire to visit Chompies in the future."
2,"My mom and I came here the day before my wedding to have a more upscale experience than my tried and true vietnamese shop.  The salon itself is lovely.  But for $75 a person, it was a complete waste of money and time.  My french manicure looked as though I could have done it myself.  Same for my mom.  After seeing the poor skills of my manicurist, I opted for a solid color on my toes...and even this was done poorly.  Everyone may speak English and the salon may look upscale, but the quality of the mani and pedi was POOR and I will not be going back.  I was embarrased after leaving but did not have time to go to a real manicurist for a polish change.  Hopefully the shoddy job doesnt show in my wedding photos."
2,"A Korean Taco Stand!?  Sounds so cool, I HAD to try it!  I love little places like this and I was so excited to give it a try.\n\nBut I hate to say it... I was pretty disappointed.  The tacos themselves were pretty good, but they put so much 'filler' with them to make it look like you're getting lots of food... that really annoyed me.\n\nThey brag about the \""3 different kids of lettuce,\""  but really people... do you get excited about eating lettuce??  I don't!!  The meat hidden under the mounds of lettuce was pretty yummy but I don't feel like I should have to search to get to it.\n\nI felt the same about their 'sweet potato fries.\""  It's very clever how the cut them suuuuuuper thin so when they put a giant handfull of them on your plate, it looks like a massive mound of food.  But in reality there's nothing substantial there at all.\n\nThere was some kind of yummy dark brown sauce that came with the tacos that was super delicious.  If they had given me tortillas actually FILLED with their meat, with some of that sauce and a LITTLE bit of lettuce... I would have been a happy girl.  But instead, I left feeling pretty jipped.  So disappointing."
2,"Crusty sheets, burnt out lights and staff constantly trying to enter your room while you're sleeping is just the beginning at this awesome hotel! At 6am some sort if construction started on the lovely roof that was located just outside of our window, at 7 the hotel security started making their way down out hallway banging on every door shouting \""open up! Security!\"" Evidently looking for some rowdy drunks that they had \""suspected left the hotel already.\"" At 8AM the first housekeeper attempted to open our door without knocking, then again at 9 and 11. The rooms here are more expensive than Aliante and far far more dingy and outdated. Definitely not worth the sleep deprivation."
2,"I ordered the Spicy Shrimp Tacos, which consisted of three shrimp tacos topped with guacamole and cucumber slaw. The dish included rice and beans, but I opted for rice only. Does anyone else despise menu items that are deceivingly labeled \""spicy\""? Since when did \""spicy\"" become \""not spicy at all\""? (insert eye roll here)\n\nAfter some eavesdropping, I learned that you could do a triad of taco options. I would've done shrimp, pork, and carne asada if I overheard that before I ordered.\n\nThe waitress was friendly, but the hostesses are completely clueless. I stood at the hostess table for a few minutes before they realized I needed a table. \n\nDue to the unnecessarily high prices (each plate is at least $15), I'll opt for one of the many other Vegas eateries the next time I'm in town."
2,"When I first moved here, I was really enjoying this place because of the very friendly staff. However, if the very friendly staff could start getting my drink order correct (wrong twice in the span of two days), it would make me more likely to go there, rather than to the Starbucks counter at Target, just across the parking lot. Not the level of customer service I expect from The Bux, sorry.   :("
2,"Food good, service not so good. For 4 people on duty and 7 patrons I would say waiting over 20 mintues to get our bill is ridiculous but try them for yourself."
2,"I didn't love my food at Super Burrito, but to be fair, I must tell you that 3 trailer-park, hillbilly, in-bred, DOUCHEBAGS, interrupted my famous \""Taco Inspection!\"" \n\nWe arrived at Super Burrito at about 2AM on a Friday night (first mistake) and immediately upon entering the restaurant and identifying myself as \""The Taco Inspector,\"" these three ass-clowns got in our face and would NOT stop talking crap--even after we got our food and sat down. \n\nThe date ended with the Scottsdale Police showing up, and well, at least we got a couple minutes of these cock-noses on video with my flip camera! \n\nYou can see the video at www.thetacoreview.com \n\nFrom what I remember, my tacos were kind of bland, but we will return for a repeat-inspection.\n\nPeace from The Taco Inspector!"
2,"I typically like Paradise Bakery. They are usually good for a quick lunch and have healthier options than most of the other \""fast\"" places in my area.\n \nThis location however, needs some work. The service as always is good, but the food leaves much to be desired. The iced tea is atrocious. I can't exactly pinpoint it, I think the container/brew filters need to be cleaned because the taste is stale. In addition to that, it is completely watered down so you can't taste the mango at all. I actually did a taste comparison to ensure I wasn't losing my mind. After lunch at Paradise Bakery I went to PV Mall and tried the tea at the location there and it was great.\n \nThe chicken salad was also huge let down. The strawberries and pineapple were not fresh, they came in heavy sweet syrup. Needless to say I was not in Paradise and will probably pass this place on my way to Wildflower going forward."
2,"\""Hey, Sandy, so the other day I was at --\""\n\""Stop talking! There's not enough time! The meat is cooking faster than we can pull it off the grill! HUSTLE!\"" \n\nWhenever people are trying out KBBQ for the first time, they always make the same observation: \""So you're telling me I am paying money to cook for myself AND serve myself?\"" You are, indeed! \n\nThe thing about Honey Pig is that the servers will actually place the meat on the grill for you, but the actual cooking is up to you. So if you are two people like we were in the conversation above, it doesn't leave too much time for conversation because you are too busy cooking, chewing, timing, grabbing, flipping, drinking, etc. Notice how \""waiting\"" is not one of the above? AIN'T NOBODY GOT TIME FOR THAT. Since the servers are putting the meat (+ kimchi, bean sprouts, and onions) on the grill for you, there's not a lot of freedom to pace the cooking process. \n\nMy friend and I opted for AYCE, so each round just seemed rushed. The only time anything was NOT was in the beginning, when we asked for water - they said OK, and then forgot - and at the end, when we asked for the check - they said OK, and then forgot. Hmm. So perhaps not the best first and last impression."
2,"Bf and I stopped here prior to the KA show.  Emeril's New Orleans Fish House is located inside the MGM where KA was playing, which made it convenient.\n\nOur server was hospitable.  I drink a lot of water with my meals.  My water glass was never empty.  \n\nWe had the tuna tacos, which were $17 for three small servings.  I didn't like the sweet flavor and the price point was too high.  We also had a side of mushrooms, which was $9.  It was equally overpriced.  The mozzarella salad was perfectly balanced.  It was light and flavorful."
2,"One of the closer Wendy's. My wife and I do not go here very often anymore. We had food missing from our order, cold or burnt sandwiches, and salads that were very wilted. \n\nThe lights for the restaurant and drive through are turned off some nights at 9 or 10 pm. It doesn't seem like they are open. We went through the drive through and were the only ones there. A lot of service errors for just us being served. \n\nWould gladly go back if the service and quality went back up."
2,"The architecture may be nice, have elevator music and all the fancy schmancy stuff but the customer service sucks and swallows. The employees are rude, they ignore the customers or simply turn around without answering a simple question. I was there yesterday and it was impossible to find someone to help me find a book I needed even the computer said there were two copies left.\n\nThanks God for Amazon.com.....they got 80 $ from me, which means I saved 10 $.\n\nIndigo got 0$ and probably will not get anything for me in quite a while"
2,"Tonight was my second visit to Sakana. My first visit was for the lunch sushi special. More sushi than I could eat, for 10 bucks. Although the Cali roles were outstanding, the other pieces were average. Tonight I stopped in for Cali rolls, unagi, and edamame. The Cali rolls looked and tasted like they had been made 30 minutes before I arrived. The Unagi was outstanding! Huge pieces of eel, served warmed, tasty and filling. Service kinda sucked, waited a long time for a drink refil. Overall, average. Will return for sushi lunch special."
2,Food was good. Service was awful. Took 46 minutes from when we bought our food for it to get to our table. Don't go on Saturday nights. Save yourself and drive a few more miles and go to the one in Chandler.
2,"Today, I finally saw CityCenter, and I was stunned by how lackluster it was.\n\nThe place in general was just lacking in character and charm. It was basically a high-tech Wynn or the Bellagio with less flowers, less art and no Italian motif. \n\nThe Aria is borderline hidden, the easiest way to get into the place by pedestrian means is through Crystals, which is confusing enough in of itself. The waterfall and colorful fountain outside were nice enough, but the execution is a total fail. What use is stuff like that if it's hidden?\n\nI walked in, started looking around when my subconscious pretension and snottiness block started going off. It was as if an alarm was going off in my head telling me \""I REALLY SHOULDN'T BE HERE.\"" Besides, the place looked immense and knowing me I would have easily gotten lost.  \n\nI'm happy I saw it once, but it seems like it worked much better in theory than it does in execution."
2,"Stopped in for lunch a few weeks ago, the verdict: overpriced mediocre and slow. The Reuben was unremarkable and I nearly died of thirst. Latenight is better with plenty of half and half stouts (ie black and blue) and generally likeable live music on weekends."
2,"Our cat recently came down with some health issues that we could not afford to address. He was in pain and we decided the humane thing was to put him to sleep. We went to the ARL and asked the receptionist there if we had any other options available to us. \""Well basically the only thing you can do is sign him over for euthanasia\"" she said in the most uncaring, apathetic voice possible. We were heartbroken of course. \""Go wait by that door and someone will meet you.\"" After a few minutes another woman came out and took the carrier. \""I'll bring your carrier back out in a minute.\"" We said no, that's okay, keep the carrier. She said okay and took our cat to the back. And that was it. No kind words, no sympathetic gestures, no \""Would you like a moment before I take him?\"" No \""I'm sorry.\"" Nothing. For us this was one of the worst days of our lives but nobody at the ARL seemed to care, or at least have been trained to pretend to care, one bit. \n\nThey get a couple stars for offering a necessary service. But other than that, this place will only be associated with making a terrible day that much worse with their lack of caring or empathy."
2,"We have had good experiences at Orange Sky, but the one on Nov. 1 was not so.  Service was good, though no one could figure out who was to serve our water for the first 15 minutes we were there.  The food (lobster bisque, king crab, and steak) also tasted good, but within about 4 hours, my wife and I both became violently ill.  I reported this the next day to the hostess, who seemed completely unconcerned.  So, we also reported it directly to management, mostly so they could investigate and possibly prevent others from having the same experience.  Management, however, was also not interested in how food poisoning occurred in its restaurant.  For the price tag you pay to eat here, I'd recommend someplace else.  Most restaurants of this caliber put food safety very high on their priorities list.  Not so at Orange Sky.  (We also were there to celebrate a special occasion.  The restaurant was not half full.  Where did they put us???  Next to the restroom.)"
2,"I've seen worse. I've even seen much worse. But this was still pretty bad.\n\nHad very clever moments, some interesting ideas, the occasional touch of \""that was kinda cool\"" -- but the end result was a feeling of, \""THAT'S what all the fuss was about?\""\n\nKids will love this show for sure \n\nFor adults, you'd be better served at Cirque's O, Mystere, or Love shows, or catch Penn & Teller over at the Rio or Amazing Johnathan wherever he's performing.\n\nI wouldn't see Blue Man Group again for free. Just too much hype and far too little substance."
2,"When I needed car service for a work related trip in Phoenix, I had my assistant call the Phoenician (the last hotel I stayed at there) for a recommendation.  They suggested Execu Car which by the way is affiliated with the familiar blue SuperShuttle.  Anyways, I had a pick-up at the airport, drop off and wait at a site, and then drop-off at the airport.  Total was 3 hours, cost $135 before tip.   The driver was nice as he should be and prompt.  Nothing special here but no red flags.."
2,"Bah. I dunno. Expensive, 'OK' food, but SO overpriced.\n\nI've probably just been in Vancouver too long where the options for dinner at a reasonable price (i.e., $50/person including wine) are numerous and delicious. Or maybe i'm just taking resto suggestions from the wrong people (read: people who make way more money than me). But i wasn't impressed with Lemeac. \n\nI guess if i'm giong to order an entree for $36 I expect a salad and dessert with it too! It just doesn't compute for me unless i'm ordering lobster or something. But it seems like this is the norm all over Montreal (or again, at the places people suggest to me). I know there are tons of great dives but I was hoping for a really awe inspiring \""OMG food in Montreal is so much better than Vancouver\"" experience and on my last day, I have yet to experience. \n\nI guess I really am a Vancouverite..."
2,"Had take-out from here tonight while visiting family in Tempe. It just wasn't anything to write home about. Not a whole lot of flavor in the Kung Po Shrimp (though the shrimp itself was pretty good), and the Hunan beef left a weird filmy taste on my tongue. No dish was less than $10 either- not worth it at all. It definitely didn't make me want to go back for the dine-in experience."
2,"I went to Benny's with my daughter for breakfast and we ordered a pretty standard breakfast: scrambled eggs, bacon, toast,home fries.\n\n-scrambles eggs had a bad texture and the bacon was kinda scraggly looking \n-my daughter liked the home fries but I prefer the option for potato style versus deep fried French fry style.\n-coffee was terrible, not unusual for a diner style breakfast place\n\nHad I paid the $2.99 early bird special price I would shrug it off as you get what you pay for but this was full price $10 each breakfast so I expected real food. Felt like the food was made using synthetic ingredients like eggs in the microwave (I've seen it done this way with my own eyes) and pre-cooked microwave bacon. Actually I feel like my breakfast was made in the microwave.\n\nService wasn't great. We were seated and the order was taken pretty quickly but after the food was delivered we never saw the waitress again. \n\nI don't personally think I'll go back to Benny's for breakfast and was disappointed I spent the money."
2,"On the one hand, the service is always friendly and helpful, and the portions are generous. On the other hand... well, the food is a mixed bag. Vegetables are usually crisp and flavorful, but the preparation of the meat and seafood leaves a good deal to be desired. Their salt-and-pepper shrimp is far greasier than it should be. Their chicken, too, suffers. Every time I go it's a little too overcooked and bland.\n\nSo if you go, I would recommend sticking with vegetarian fare. They do a decent job with that."
2,I joined Kansas City Barbecue Society for $35 just to be able to get free day passes to RD. I was really interested in trying some of their private label wines.  Unfortunately at the cash register I found out you can't buy any alcohol from them unless you have a liquor license.  Then I had to wait for about a half an hour to get a refund after they overcharged me $6 for an 11 lb. bar of Callebaut dark chocolate that had been entered in their computer wrong.  Not a happy camper.
2,"I've never eaten in at Crandall's, only ordered from them via grubhub.com, so that's what I'm reviewing. The food is fine, but they have no idea what they're doing at the restaurant. I've ordered from them three times and will never order from them again. The first time I ordered from Crandall's, I realized that I had entered the wrong address in grubhub so I called the restaurant to let them know. They had no idea what grubhub was and insisted on rudely telling me I had the wrong restaurant. The second time I ordered from them, I got a call - after an hour of waiting for the food - saying that they were out of what I had ordered. The third time, they packaged my order wrong and I received the wrong food. When I called to ask them to send me the correct order, they insisted it was the delivery guy's fault. I have no idea what goes on at that restaurant, but it is terribly run. I've never had such bad service. I've never written a Yelp review before, but I'm so annoyed with them that I felt it merited a review."
2,"Very disappointed with service. We arrived a few minutes before a party of 3 people and signed in well before them. We were completely ignored. We were a party of two. No seats at bar area. Party of 3 seated at open table instead of us. We were told the table was too big for us. 10 min later we were seated at the same size table. We were never given a menu as the other table was.  Hostess was very rude. We ordered several items not on the conveyor belt. Half of it arrived and we had to reorder the other half as they \""lost\"" the rest of what we ordered. Definety a bad experience. Obviously this restaurant only wants large parties as we have come with large groups in the past and had good experiences."
2,"We live downtown Madison and have eaten at nearly every restaurant. We get asked a lot for restaurant recommendations. I'd say we are fairly discriminating and know the restaurant scene in Madison. Our recent experience at Cento was way below average for a Food Fight operation. We sat at the bar, adequately staffed with 4 bartenders, on a Friday evening. The poor service we received was unacceptable. Where do I start...\nNo silver ware- had to ask\nNo napkins- had to ask\nWater glasses empty- had to ask\nDrinks empty - had to ask\nOverall unattentive service that only responded when I ran someone down.  \nFood was good. Not great. Bartenders were nice but clueless and had no concept of teamwork and customer service. It impacted our experience and was noticed by a couple next to us from Chicago, who were upset with their service as well. \nI spoke kindly to the manager at the end of the night to share my experience. He was receptive and thanked me. Even asking for my name and number so he could invite us back to give cento another chance. To make matters worse...he never called me back. \nBaffling! I won't forget this. Not sure I want to go back. I've since shared my experience with others. Remarkably another set of friends had a similar experience the next night at their large table foodies. \nBottom line- I had much better service at the Echo Tap and the Big Ten Pub. Cento should visit and learn a thing or five."
2,I just got back from London last week and have been craving Indian food ever since i got back after eating it every other day while there. I came across Taza on Eastern and saw they had a  lunch buffet and gave it a shot. The service is great and the decor is nice as well. Do like the very BIG flat screen they have too. There are a lot of choices for the lunch buffet and it is a good deal for your $ but the food was very dry and not very tasty. The best thing i had there was the naan and soup. Looks like i will have to wait until i go back to London to get some quality Indian
2,this place is only getting 2 stars bc:\n\n-i was already drunk\n-met some really cool asians from texas\n-the dj was alright\n-my boo got me a double shot of patron.\n\nother than that... it was pretty DEAD.\n\nsince i was drunk getting there.. which hotel was this club at any way?
2,"I came here looking for the usual- California Burrito and some Jamaica.  I did not get either.  I went through drive-thru and the person taking my order didnt understand my English, so I had to come to the window to ask about their menu.  I could barely understand her English, so I just opted for some quesadilla.  It was okay and I cant compare it to the usual Mexican food I have at Vaqueros on 19th and Southern.  The food was just okay and I was disappointed mostly because I did not have someone who spoke clear English- customer service was okay otherwise."
2,The ramen was too salty for my taste. I can't tell if the ingredients were tasty.  The saltiness masked or overwhelmed everything.  Too bad.  Nice place and good service.
2,"Made a reservation a month in advance for 7, noting that it was an anniversary dinner (and hoping for one of the curtained off couples tables.) Called the night of and asked if we could change the reservation to 7:30 since we were running late.  We were informed that we could not and that we needed to make it within 15 min of our original reservation in order to be seated.  We rushed and made it right at the \""cutoff\"" mark, and were seated at a huge table, I assumed because all the couples tables were full.  After getting settled in, we looked around only to find the restaurant dead empty.  We were one of maybe 5 parties there.  Why the rush?  Would have given only one star if not for the great food, and having plenty of leftovers for lunch the next day.  The server was quite attentive, so I think it's just the hostess desk that's not up to par.\n\nNote; this will be a long meal so plan accordingly.  You can't do this place quick, its an experience."
2,"Wow. What a let down! My husband and I stayed at the Planet Hollywood hotel and they gave us coupons for the buffet. We stopped in one morning for breakfast because we'd read lots of good reviews about it...and let's just say we were seriously disappointed. And glad we used those coupons so we didn't pay full price for it!\n\nEverything - and I mean EVERYTHING - was cold!! Our first go around we loaded up with eggs, hash browns, bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy, etc. and not one single thing was hot. Not even warm. Cold. That is not the experience you expect when going to a buffet. We left most of that food on our plates and made a second trip to see if maybe we just needed to stir things around or pick from the bottom of the trays, try getting things from a different area - but arrived back at our table to find the second round cold as well. Boo!\n\nHighly disappointing experience, since everything tasted good - those biscuits and gravy would have been a delight - but who wants to eat cold eggs and meat for breakfast? Which left us wondering too how safe the food was if it isn't kept at a proper temperature! \n\nThey had a decent selection and variety, and for the price I'm sure it would be a good value if the food was actually edible. I've had much better buffets in Vegas. Won't be going back!"
2,On my way to jersey mike's decided to stop and check it out. I decided to order 3 tacos to go and my friend order 2 tacos...it took 30 minutes to get my 3 tacos. The hostess was very apologetic but i figured they would offer me some chips and salsa or even a soft drink while we waited. Prices are pretty high for an off the strip taco place.  $12 for 3 tacos.  The Al Pastor taco was good. The Chicken tinga was bland with not much flavor.
2,"The staff at Lonnie's is horrible, not just once, but every time. They are rude, slow, and rush you out at closing. The reason I go back is there selection of cane glass beads are the best I've found anywhere and that's all I buy there."
2,"Very disappointing food, service, and experience.\n\nI've eaten at Delmonicos and Emeril's Fish House, so I should have been prepared for the overall poor experience of going to Table 10.  I deducted a star for the taste of the food, a star for the service, and a star for the price point.  Usually when hyou pay for an expensive meal, you way quality tasting food and service.  However, this place was just a disappointment.  I will never go back again.  The only bright spot I can say is that this place is better than the Fish House.  That place is disgusting."
2,"This is for the curbside check in people at the east economy lot. First of all, I don't appreciate being there 95 minutes before my flight, having to wait 6 or 7 minutes for the people in front of me to get done, then get turned away because I'm 88 minutes from my flight. The guy running the show, who isn't very nice, says his computer won't let him do it. I think it's an excuse to be lazy. If it really is the computer thing, they should really build in a grace period. 5 minutes is fine. \n\nThe curbside check in thing is a great service, but they are really turning into luggage nazis. \n\nBottom line: make sure you are there 100 minutes or more before your flight or else you'll be pissed off and stressed out like I was."
2,"Walked in for a small bite to eat and saw all kinds of fried stuff. Wings fish (multiple species), shrimp gizzards etc.  I was about to get some of the gizzards but the lady working there said it was wing day.\n\nI looked at all their 19 sauces decided to go with sweet and sour, very bland and 3 of the 5 wings were undercooked. Normally I'd eat them but they were far from being done.  So I won't go back!"
2,"Uggghhh. I have been here a few times, and it is simply not all that great.  The servers continually come around with carts full of greasy, fried Chinese food that may or may not be hot.\n\nThe service is terrible and only about one in three dishes is particularly good.  The fried shrimp balls and the egg tarts are among the better options.\n\nHowever, and this is a big \""however\"", if you like the idea of a Chinese buffet that is brought to your table by people who speak no English or French, you may like it.  There are also lots of Chinese people who eat here, so i am open to the possibility of being way off base on this one. Some of the fried items my friends who insist on coming here rave about taste eerily similar to lukewarm Chicken McNuggets to me.\n\nIf you have a group of friends and a couple of pre-dinner drinks before coming here, you might love this. It may also be good for those who want to eat in preparation for something like the World Chinese Food Eating Competition (or poor, hungry college students)."
2,"Sorry kids, I hate to dumb this down but we read about Dino's and were shocked to find it as a cinder block, boring bar in the middle of the wretched strip befor even downtown.  At night when it fills up with crazy drunks it might appeal to somebody but not me. Dean Martin never drank here, for a reason."
2,"The only negative dining experience I had in Montreal. The lady behind the counter was super friendly but our server was disinterested and defensive. The food, which was already made (just pasteries, cake) took 30 minutes, and we wound up being late for our flight. No, we probably shouldn't have gone here right before our flight, but who would have thought it would take so long to bring me a piece of cake I literally pointed at?\n\nMore over, when we politely asked to have it to go because of the flight, she was really rude.\n\nOh, and they also have frappe's on the menu but not available for order...what's that about. She just said they didn't have a blender. I guess that may be, but then why have them on the menu? Or perhaps she just didn't want to make them? The world may never know..."
2,"I was here last year. Not impressed. Food was not memorable. Atmosphere was too casual if that's possible. Too many flies in this way-open, patio-style restaurant. Service was - well I don't remember. But what I do remember was that there is nothing about this place that says, \""Come back!\"" ...Nada. My experience wasn't awful but I have no incentive to return when there are so many other places to eat at Tempe Marketplace."
2,"My husband and I sat at the bar for dinner before we had to catch a flight. The food was overall good, but didn't justify the prices. I could eat at Kabuto for what we paid to eat there and still left hungry. We paid close to $300 for 2 people and I didn't even order a drink.\n\nThe rock shrimp was really good, so we ordered another one which then came out soggy and also took awhile because the kitchen was backed up. Everything else was pretty standard with regards to the sushi we ordered. Overall, the food was ok but I don't think I'll return when there are so many other options in the city off the strip."
2,"we had dinner here on Saturday might with a party of five people. We were\nGiven such poor service by a waiter named Tommy. he had one of the worst \nAttitudes of any server that I had in a upper scale restaurant in a long time.\nThe salad and the appetizers were marginal and the cocktails were weak and \nOverrated. my father had the bone in cowboy steak that was like shoe leather. we waited over a. Hour to be served our dinner and were shocked by the poor service...... Amanda the manager on duty tried extremely hard to make up for,the deficiencies and offered the table desserts and a complimentary cocktail. \nTHERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR,THIS TYPE OF TREATMENT. THE WAITER \nTOMMY SURELY DOES. NOT BELONG WORKING IN A RESTAURANT LIKE \nTHIS,OTHER THAN A ONE STAR DINER KN THE STRIP."
2,They bring great DJ's but the club itself just feels awkward.  I feel embarrassed for my town when global DJ's come (i.e. Adam Freeland) and the crowd is lame (which ALWAYS happens).  It's just not the right crowd or place for these DJ's.  I wish they would take the DJ thing and move it over to Bar Smith. I feel like they'd do it right there...
2,"Unless you like your crepes really plain - don't bother with this place. The price is just not worth it. $9 for a mixed berry crepe with three SMALL pieces of berries. There were a few crepes laid out for examples, and I thought the fruit on some of them were just for decoration because there was just so little. Hahaha, no. \n\nIf you want gelato, I reccommend that little gelato stand in the Canals instead. I've stayed at the Venetian and Palazzo around 5 times combined in the past year and I ALWAYS get the mango sorbet from that stand. It's so light and fluffy, and so sweet, and omg I WANT IT NOW."
2,"I came in with great expecations for this place, but walked out pretty dissapointed.  The facilities were unimpressive for both the Canyon Ranch name and the $35 admission fee.  I would strongly suggest taking your money and visiting elsewhere."
2,Rat hole. Over priced food coming from ratty Pantless waitresses. I only gave this place one star out of pity.
2,"It was really just barely okay. The descriptions of the food sound heavenly...chili and lime shrimp, grilled scallops with mango salsa, etc. The presentation is nice. But the flavors were really lacking. The food was definitely overpriced; we got 4 pieces of shrimp for something like $14. Our scallops were undercooked. \n\nThe servers were very friendly, polite, and attentive. The decor is definitely striking and beautiful. I think I would come back if I were looking for a trendy place to drink. But the food won't get me back in the door, unfortunately."
2,"I was very surprised by my visit tonight. This was not my first visit to BJ's. At our table of seven chairs, 4 of them were broken. This is a huge accident waiting to happen.   We started out our meal with the calamari appetizer. This was very good. No issues there.  Then with the meal, I ordered the margarita flat bread. I have ordered this before and loved it. Tonight was not the same. I think it had been sitting under the heat lamp for awhile before it was brought to the table. The last time I remember that it had more fresh basil on it, too. This time the basil didn't even cover the entire pizza and it was not very fresh. I couldn't even taste it. My daughter ordered the shrimp scampi. She asked for some grated Parmesan on it and they brought her some packets of Parmesan and told her they couldn't find the grater.  Really?  I am giving them 2 stars only because I know how good it can be ... how good it has been.  I don't know what is going on here but they need some serious attention from upper management to get it back to where it used to be starting with the broken chairs."
2,"I don't even know where to begin....which is ironic because it was hard to find this typical east valley type bar-in-a-strip-mall. I really wasn't sure what to make of the place with the crabby face on the door. \nThere are couple different areas to the place and when packed I could see it having a college house party charm. But empty, you just get the smell of fried food and punching while watching younger folks who think they got dressed up to go to Scottsdale but instead ended up in a Gilbert strip mall.\nI was here to listen to some accoustic sets - not the best  venue for that. Distracted by the TVs, Golden Tee video screen, and a real punching bag game machine (as macho as it gets boys)...So I had one drink, one drink only ($6.50 for Jameson's...really Toby?!?!) and am still perplexed at what this place is trying to be and why they would let people punch a bag during an accoustic music set. Big patio outside, big room inside with a stage and punching machine, and a smaller room for darts and pool. It was kind of like the place I worked back in Iowa that had a buffet, bowling alley, roller rink and minigolf. you can't be all things to all people...but maybe in Gilbert that's a possibility."
2,"I love me some Popeyes Chicken, and tonight was the night that my husband wanted them so I quickly obliged.\n\nService was terrible, however.  I wasn't greeted or acknowledged to place my order.  I have to make eye contact and asked if the cashier was ready for me.  After I placed my order, I realized there was a current deal that the cashier didn't bother to share.  C'mon now, the deal on the side board changes frequently so how the heck am I to see it right away?  \n\nAnyways, thought that was the end of the bad service...NOPE.  The  person that put together my order was cold and stingy.  I have to ask for every bit of sauces and condiments for my order.  She didn't look happy at all handing me the sauces.\n\nThe chicken tasted good as usual, but I hope these not so happy employee find another job that they will be happy doing...cuz this aint it for them."
2,"We went to this place for a my buddy's bachelor party this weekend. We called and set up a reservation for 6 at a specific time and left our number. We got there and there they told us there was no reservation. The woman working was nice enough, but said she got a call about some guys but didn't know what it meant and had no phone number. They happen to have one seat available, but it would be hours until any other openings so...that was it She didn't try to fix the issue, she didn't give us a discount. The guy who's party it was had a nice shave, but that was it. The rest of got nothing. It was a real bummer. So, don't believe your reservation I guess."
2,"I've been having mad cravings for a really good hot fudge sundae... We were driving down Lancaster and I that saw Rita's had frozen custard. I decided to give them a try. I walked into the small shop and was greeted by a young employee. She pointed out the list of Italian ice flavors posted on the wall. I asked how the custard was and she said it was \""really good.\"" I ordered a kid's hot fudge sundae... I was handed a small cup filled about half way with a pretty sad looking drizzle of hot fudge on top... Here was the shocker... I paid $4.70 for a kid's hot fudge sundae... For real?? The \""custard\"" was ok... it really wasn't custard at all but a thick soft serve (traditional frozen custard is scooped, not swirled out of a machine!). The hot fudge was just the cheap canned stuff... Needless to say, I'll be continuing my search for the best hot fudge sundae in Charlotte."
2,"I usually eat at fast/cheap Mexican places because I am not a fan of places like Garcias, macayos, Arriba etc but I have been looking for a good/authentic sit down Mexican food restaurant for a while. After I saw that this place had a 4 star rating and a name in Spanish I decided to give it a try. I was pretty excited to see actual Mexicans eating there! When the chips and salsa arrived my excitement died a bit but I try not to judge on chips and salsa alone. We ordered a plain cheese crisp as an appetizer and it was actually pretty good; it was crispy and not too oily. The main dishes arrived and they were a major disappointment! The tacos were oily and bland. The beans and rice were not much better. Overall this is typical Americanized Mexican food; overly fried, bland, and greasy like most Mexican places. Nothing special or authentic here. I shan't be returning. My search continues..."
2,"The first time i walked into One Love Vapors was back in early October and i knew they were just newly opened. Saw them on yelp and decided to see whats up. I walked in and everything was nice, some music playing, i was greeted, and the guy helping me was very energetic and very friendly. \n\nNow, I haven't been able to drive by again and visit until just about a week ago. I wanted to see what was new, their juices, see if the same guys work there, and just to hang out. I walked in, it was extremely quiet, the guy who i remember came out and asked what i needed. I just wanted to try some juice and he gave me the menu(s). i chose a few and he let me try them. out of maybe 5 flavors, 3 tasted burnt. unfortunately.  This guy changed in a few months i think. Either he was just tired that day, or he just doesnt like the business. This visit was nothing like my first. Customer Service completely fell and i'm uninterested in ever wanting to visit.\n\n2 stars for a couple juices that i sampled and liked."
2,"Food was decent but the place was filthy. All trash receptacles were full...gross! No clean tables because people couldn't throw their trash away, so they left it on the table!"
2,"The drinks were pretty good; I had the dirty chai. The service, was the worst I've ever received. \n\nI felt extremely unwelcome and it took 10 minutes to make a couple drinks. During that time, the two people working behind the counter never looked at us and took their sweet time making the drinks. \n\nWe considered leaving several times. \n\nI will not be going back."
2,"Good selection of Calvin Klein clothes.  If you buy anything double check their specials. Often when you get the cash register you'll discover the price you thought you were buying something is completely different than the price marked. So if you're one of those type of people (like me) that spend a lot of time shopping and trying clothes on and then going to the register and finding the prices completely different you will be very aggravated, to say the least."
2,"It took approximately 15 minutes from the time we were seated to receive water and menus, but from then they were somewhat attentive. I ordered a bloody mary before we started and it was, by far, the worst beverage I have been served in years. It was not drinkable. From there, unfortunately, things remained the same. Two of the meals we received were not described well by the waitstaff and needed to be replaced... of course after the rest of us had finished our dinner. I ordered the Chicken Zanagrelli which sounded excellent but was not executed well. The sauce was flavorful but the chicken was inedible from a consistency and flavor standpoint. When they cleared my plate they asked if I wanted a box to which I replied \""no.\"" \n\nThe manager on staff that evening came over and apologized profusely for the meals that had been described incorrectly, and asked how the replacement meals were... to which one of the recipients said \""pretty good\"" - now that should have been a clue that they were just being polite - a term like great or excellent would have been what they should have been listening for.  \n\nThey really did try hard to fix the situation and they have lovely ambiance, but don't think this will be on the return list."
2,"I decided to check this place out because I come to this center to run errands.The inside is clean and the cashier was friendly.\n\n   I ordered a torta de lengua which is cow tongue.Frankly, I found the torta to be lackluster in flavor and it just didn't meet my expectations . I doubt that I will be returning anytime soon."
2,"Went here to celebrate my friends last night home before deployment. The bouncers were extremely rude, took my friends  state and military ID and told us we had to chase down the PD to get his ID's verified and approved. After spending some time with the police exchanging all the necessary information the bouncer let my friend in. \n\nIt's too bad the bouncers suck, bc the place is pretty cool."
2,"Tonight was my first time at Pisces, and I have nothing to bad to say about the food. The sushi options were very creative and the rolls my boyfriend and I ordered (Crunchy Spicy Tuna, Leo, Eel Special, Spicy Tuna) were delicious. However, the service was not as satisfying.\n\nI watched as our sushi sat at the bar, waiting for pick up, for about ten minutes. Meanwhile, our server milled about the restaurant doing nothing in particular. When our food was finally delivered, she had requested that tobiko be put on the wrong roll. Not a problem, I just requested some extra on the side for the naked roll. Our server agreed to the request then disappeared. She didn't come near our table again until the meal was over, and then offered me the side of tobiko with a smug, \""well I guess it's a little late\"".\n\nI got her name off the receipt, and if I return, I will not be sitting in her section. The food at a restaurant can be incredible, but bad service can make or break a meal. I hope that this is something the management recognizes and works on."
2,I love this bar. I love the beer selection. I love the bartenders. I hate the music. The music selection isn't appealing toward any sort of crowd. A jukebox for customer selection would be awesome. The music transitions are terrible and ruins the ambiance of the bar.
2,Great coffee if they get your order right.  Problem is it's usually only about 50% of the time.  Breakfast is good if you have time to wait for it.  Skip lunch though.  There are better places in the area to eat for the same price.\n\nStaff is always very friendly but the line is always chaotic.  They definitely need more training and/or more staff.
2,"This place boasts of being a \""traditional British pub,\"" and in the short time it took the new owners to convert this former Italian caf\u00e9, they have undoubtedly gone to lengths to make it look the part! \n\nI will say this though: I found the price of drinks to be more than a little bit cheeky. $8.50 for a pint of generic import beer (Newcastle, Sapporo, Carlsberg) is a bit rich! Are you having a laugh?! \n\nThey did have Murphy's Irish stout, which you don't see elsewhere too often, but even then it tasted a bit off. After paying $27 (tip included - we're not REALLY in England) for 3 pints, any illusion I had of being in a traditional British pub fell by the wayside. \n\nNo thanks, I'd much rather drink pints of cheaper and fresher tasting local beer a few blocks away at Dieu Du Ciel. \n\nI can't speak to the quality of the food because I did not eat, but my companion said the homemade egg noodles and roasted eggplant ragout was tasty. It definitely looked and smelled very appetizing! The menu had some good looking choices. Apart from the Ploughman's Lunch for $13, it's not close to your typical traditional pub fare - but then again we are in Montreal so it's predictable that menus and ingredients skew towards high end and somewhat showy. \n\nAll in all, just a bit off the mark, but the after-work Ubisoft crowd will love it!"
2,"Pancakes are just flour, egg, milk, and fluff... so why are they ten dollars here?  I think this place is overrated.  If you have a friend that is a good cook, convince him or her to make you breakfast.  It will be better and you will be able to drink water whenever you want.  You can get it yourself and, no doubt, in a timely fashion.  The only disadvantage to the stay at home plan is that you may not be able to watch a great dane down plate of eggs that his owners purchased for him.  That was amazing.  That great dane eats well."
2,"Someone shoot me next time I try to come here.  I don't know why I come back here.  The only saving grace is the service.  Food sucks. The steaks have been flattened by a bus so it's pretty much impossible to have it cooked any way but well done.  The noise level is ridiculous.  I was literally shivering eating dinner, it's so cold.  I guess they have to keep it so cold so they can cool down the outside seating area (and the rest of Las Vegas.)\nIn a word -- sucks."
2,"Ill start with the good. The bartenders are very friendly and make you feel welcome as most wing/bar joints will. Now on to the bad. This is a wing joint. Their wings are on the low end of the totem pole when it comes to size, flavor, and freshness. Ive been in 3 times and the first time my wings were literally cold. Some were luke warm. Not crispy, not freshly cooked, and 8 of the 12 wings were tiny. The other 2 visits were a little better but when it boils down to it Beef o Bradys and Bdubs both kill this place.  Its a nice layout, is clean, and has mostly friendly staff but unfortunately its not a hospital so the food has to be good as well to get more than 2 stars."
2,"The ammo selection currently suffers due to the nationwide shortages, and probably the number of stores.  Recently purchased a handgun, the staff is not incredibly knowledgable, and I felt they were doing me a favor selling me a gun.  sorry for the intrusion...\n\nThe manager who checked the final paperwork did not look at me, talk to me, or even hand my ID back.  Just dropped it on the counter, walked away.  Well, sorry, again.\n\nHandgun selection is improving, prices are mostly MSRP, with some exceptions.  An entirely average experience, shop there just to see if there is anything interesting.  last week there was, I bought, but, well, was not especially cared about.  Hey, it was only a grand, maybe great service has a price threshold."
2,"I used to come here often since they are open till late. In the past, they had so so coffee, usually cold even when they just serve you. Now I tried tea thinking it will be a better and hot option. The water is even not boiled, so disappointing! It is just matter of having a kettle on the deck... i like the casual feeling of the place and friendly stuff, hope they will improve their quality, and won't take their customers guaranteed."
2,Meh! it's just OK. The fries were over cooked and the burger was just another burger. Nothing to write home about.
2,"Portions were very small. The food I got (butter chicken) wasn't bad, but a little too salty. But $7 for the tiniest portion ever. A restaurant can make up for price by adding value (friendly service, great ambience), but Wok Box fails on those fronts as well. Next time I'm at that mall and hungry, I'll walk next door to Chipotle and get a better value for my $7."
2,"I usually love Jamba Juice, but this location is lacking. I've been here a few times now and every time there has been a wait. The last visit, there were 4 people ahead of me already waiting for their orders with only one girl making the smoothies. So it was a 10+ minute wait for my order. I ordered a strawberry bowl which comes with granola and topped with bananas ad fresh strawberries. As the cashier was assembling the bowl, he stopped to take someone else's order, handled cash and then proceeded to assemble my bowl again. He did put on gloves but did not wash his hands before putting on the gloves. So pretty much he put on dirty gloves. I used to work in the food industry and that was totally unacceptable. Too bad...looks like I have to go to a farther location to get my smoothie fix."
2,"This is my first Cirque show and absolutely DID NOT like it.  I don't want to give anything away but some of the acrobatic stunts I saw reminds me of stunts I see at the Circus.  Nothing too impressive!!!  I found myself struggling to stay awake in parts of the show.  For $100, I expect a lot more!\n\nI would rather pay a little bit more to enjoy an exceptional show such as Le Reve across at the Wynn.  \n\nDefinitely not the best show you can watch in Vegas.  Watch something else!"
2,"One of the only disappointments at the Wynn\n\nSugar & Ice is located in the esplanade at the Wynn.  Near the many boutiques, Sugar & Ice should be the perfect place to grab lunch, a snack, or something sweet before venturing out onto the Las Vegas Strip.  Unfortunately, it's far from perfect.  \n\nFirst of all, you can expect to wait quite some time for your food to be brought to your table.  The menu is quite limited unless you are looking for gelato or cookies.  If you're looking for a salad or sandwich, you will have to make due with very few options.  We ordered the grilled chicken panini.  To our surprise, it was just sliced deli chicken and not a real grilled chicken breast.  The bread was incredibly greasy and the cheese and aioli was way too salty.\n\nIf you are looking to satisfy your sweet tooth, this may be a good place to stop by.  But if you are looking for lunch or a more substantial snack, this is not a good option.  Not at all."
2,I have been to several Planet Fitness since joining a month ago and this location is the worst by far. The bathroom area is always dirty A light has been out in the showers for over a week. Hydro beds don't work right and staff acts like they don't want to be there\n Not a good representation of the chain.
2,Location: very unique up on small mountain side. Provides a very nice view. Decent amount of parking. \n\nService: very good. Very friendly hostess and waiter. \n\nFood quality: rolls and salad tasted good. Nothing mind blowing but good. I ordered the rib eye. Not bad. Also not good. Imagine buying the lowest level grade steak from the store and cooking it without much thought. No crazy spices. Edible but not great. Came with vegetables that didn't look terribly healthy. I wasn't expecting fine dining but was hoping for more. Was there with 4 other people and the feeling towards the food was mutual among us. \n\nAmbiance: it was ok. A bit loud but I was sort of expecting that after walking past the huge smelly bull out front :) I did take the slide which was funny. \n\nWould I come back:  unlikely. I'm glad we tried it so I can say I've tried it but the food wasn't terribly enjoyable and it certainly wasn't cheap so there are much better options in that part of town.
2,"In college, I loved looking through the racks here with friends on a rainy day.  It was like our own movie montage dress-up moment.  It's fun to browse, but beware that the clerks a bit snotty.\n\nBuying is another story.  The quality of the clothing has gone done over the years and it's more difficult to find high-end brands.  For the lower-end stuff, you can do better with the Macy's sale racks or at Goodwill.  The prices here are high all around in fact--you can do way better on the 70s/80s items at any nearly vintage shop in New York or on eBay or Etsy."
2,"The food was subpar and the service below that.  We initially planned on a complete dining experience here, but after having the Seviche sampler, which only 1 of the 3 choices we selected was even above average we decided to take our taste buds elsewhere.  The decor is very nice, but the food and service don't match that quality."
2,"I really wanted to like this place. I was a first time customer and my lady had been before. I ordered a beer, which was definitely good, but I also ordered the calzone which was not good at all. I asked for sauce on the side, but it was filled with sauce. I don't love chunky sauce, so I use it sparingly. With it inside it was almost a waste. When I got to the middle it was cold. I was so disgusted by the entire experience. My lady told me to send it back, but we were in a hurry and didn't have time to wait for another. Nice location, bad product this time."
2,"THIS is a Crowne Plaza? I must disagree. So I'm not on the club floor, but since when is a fourth-floor King Suite more comparable to Section 8 housing than a reputable hotel chain? I feel like I have gone back in time, to my baby-boomer parent's 1980's bungalow (not on the beach people - think small, dark, smelly and well, 80s). \n\nTowels? Yuck. Wallpaper? Significantly peeling off the walls. Windowsill? Covered in bugs ON THE INSIDE. Curtains? Burned with cigarettes. Furniture? Sagging and questionable. I could go on, but I'm sure you get the point. \n\nWe checked in around midnight after driving to Madison from Chicago in a horrible snowstorm. I was in NO mood for the clueless night auditor who argued with us about everything and then could not seem to locate one luggage cart or extra pillow. Give me a break. \n\nI think everything here looks dirty, low-brow and in need of an upgrade. Considering I have to stay two more nights I'm going to go ahead and suck it up, but for those of you who aren't here yet, I would go ahead and make a beeline for the other direction."
2,"Will give Echo & Rig another try because our steaks were amazing, perfectly cooked and flavored. Unfortunately, the service was not up to par. We dined downstairs, early dinner. We watched as one couple left because there was no server in sight. When  one popped up, we seemed to haven disturb her. Took our order, no follow up, just the check."
2,Very average buffet and a bit expensive for the quality of food. Its about $30 per person on the weekend. The food variety is average for a Vegas buffet althiugh nothing to write home about.
2,"Im going to keep it real with you, on here. I came here on a Saturday, and I saw just average looking females in the place. The place is overated and overcharged. The music is good here and bartenders were nice; but that is as good as it gets. I mean when I go to Vegas, I expect to see woman in their, that look like Pamela Anderson. The place just didn't excite me. $20 to get in, 40 dollars a lap dance; COME ON MAN."
2,"Just ok. Somewhat disappointed as we are looking for a great sports bar we can walk to from the Islands.  Went during happy hour, but couldn't get the happy hour \""special\"" (which is a measly $1 off appetizer) because we wanted to sit in the dining room.  Got the fajitas which didn't come with anything (had to pay extra for beans and rice).  Nice size portion of meat, but got charged extra for more tortillas (only came w/ 3) and the waitress didn't tell us we'd get charged - I hate that!  Hubby said his steak was good.  Lots of big screen tvs to watch sports. Service was fair."
2,"The food was very good quality. Very fresh and well prepared. The variety and selection was smaller than most buffets in Vegas. The desserts bar left much to be desired. The only option for plates was the heated plates used for food, which caused the ice cream and chocolate to melt.\nThe service was average. It was not a bad experience, but it was not nearly the great experience that everyone claimed it to be, and not worth the 25 dollars it cost. $10-15 would be a better price for what you get."
2,"Ordered take out last night as I was in the mood for Moo shoo pork.  This place is close by so laziness prevailed.  I got the moo-shoo home and I was so hungry I just keep on eating.  I then realized that my whole mouth smelled of onion.  Very much so.  I have had moo-shoo pork in MANY, MANY restaurants.  It consists of a lot of cabbage, mushrooms and some onion.  BUT THIS WAS ONION, ONION, ONION.  I brushed my teeth twice before going to bed and in the morning I could still smell the onion on my breath.  I don't know what happened with this order, but I don't think the chef was on his game or understands what moo-shoo-pork is supposed to be.  This is a well known restaurant that is supposed to be good.  That's why the owner needs to know that chef on duty did not do a good job on this dish."
2,Mediocre service and sub-par food quality.  I'd rather make my own breakfast than go here.  If you're committed to having someone else scramble your eggs go to a nicer place that focuses more on quality rather than quantity...seriously this place is huge and you won't really enjoy yourself.  I know I didn't.\n\nThere are plenty of other places to go in the immediate area...I just really don't think this place is getting into a car and driving for.
2,"So it was around 1am on a Saturday night in Vegas and I became REALLY hungry as soon as my friend told me there was pretty much no decent restaurants open. Wolfgang was the only option in the MGM past 11pm. The looks of this place kind of puts you off. There are these huge ring things around the front of it. Despite the daunting looks of this place the staff was pretty nice and they were BUSY. One of the many thing I love about Vegas.... that it can feel like its noon at 1am in the morning.\n\nI got the Mushroom, Talleggio & Leeks pizza. Which was just what the doctor ordered for my post midnight hunger pains. But they put raw leeks on the pizza. I think the heat from the pizza is supposed to cook the leeks. But they put so many on that the sheer heat of the pizza couldn't cook all of them. Raw leeks not my favorite thing to eat. \n\nServer took a really long time bringing me my drink. I almost canceled but I needed a little whiskey (I'm a whiskey girl through and through). I got the Makers Mark + Peach drink. Which quite frankly was the best idea EVER! Peaches and whiskey what more can you ask for? Giving 2 stars  because the menu is overpriced and service was slow + raw leeks. With all the culinary delights in Vegas I don't think I would come back here."
2,"I came to pick up some teriyaki chicken before driving back to LA. Food quality and taste here was eh. The teriyaki was smothered in sauce and piled on top of rice. It was a little salty. It seems like they just carelessly put together the food. \n\nGiven its location, its intent is to serve students. Hence, generous portions, cheap prices and whatever tasting food."
2,"Meh.  Old Chicago changed their pizza menu and it's definitely not as good.  Their new \""Tavern style\"" pizza is basically a less-good version of their NY-style pizza (which they no longer sell).  Both mine and my friend's pizzas were really salty.  Wasn't impressed.\n\nOne of my biggest food-service pet peeves is staff who don't know what they're talking about.  I understand that just because you work somewhere doesn't mean you have all the answers--but if you don't know something, you shouldn't just LIE to the customer.  I asked our waitress if the Specialty pizzas were included in the half-off deal for Tuesday nights.  She said yes.  We got our bill--which she checked before giving to us--and I paid.  Of course, after we left I realized that our bill was about $5 too high.  Because the 50% hadn't been taken off my pizza.  Because specialty pizzas aren't included in the half off deal.  Won't be back to Old Chicago--not a fan of how they've changed their pizza, and the mistake on the bill was enough to keep me from returning."
2,"OMG, I never stayed in such an old overprice hotel in Vegas before,  well this is it. \n\nI loved their buffet but they could definitely upgrade their rooms. We went with a group and heard their room was a bit more modern but all the TV's had big backs on them? come on, all that $ and can't even upgrade to flat screens? \n\nThe shower had little to nothing water pressure and I felt like i was showering with drops of water...Will NEVER stay there again."
2,"I'd have to disagree largely with a lot of the reviewers. I've been to this location about 4 times and was introduced to it by a former boyfriend. It's a hole in the wall, no other way to go around it. That can be a good or a bad thing. Sometimes you experience the best food in places like those. That wasn't the case for me. The hookah just was not very good. The decor seemed cheap and the waitresses were young and it was obviously their first time serving in the industry. I will say it is authentic, but i've definitely had better. The food was okay. Not great, just okay. I'm not sure if I would go back."
2,"Blah! That's the sound I made after spitting out several oysters at Vinnie's. The dozen raw were just fine. Not the best tasting oysters but good but covered the craving. The half bucket of \""steamed\"" were overcooked, rubbery and all the juices drained out. They all tasted like mud. Our server was more concerned with getting off her shift early than working our table. If there is a next time for me at Vinnie's, I think I will stick to foods that can be dropped into a fryer. By the way, where is the RAW BAR in that place? The server did bring us another half bucked \""Steamed\"" but she said they were \""micked\"" - does that mean MICROWAVE? What kinds of Oyster bar is this?"
2,"Dry, Dry and Dry are my first three descriptors.  Next I would say flavorless.  Tons of frosting that is not very good.  I had the carrot cake and it is so dry you must have ice cream or a liquid with it, also it had no flavor at all.  Essentially the same for the frosting, although it is not dry.  Tons of frosting and a sugary taste.  Bought two carrot cake cupcakes and am tossing the second one."
2,"If you're craving the McRib at a time when it's not offered at McD's, then Dickey's has got you covered!\n\nDon't be fooled by the smell.. Dickey's is to BBQ what Taco Bell is to Mexican. I went to Dickey's for lunch and ordered the Westerner, a sandwich with pulled pork and sausage, along with macaroni and cheese and loaded mashed potatoes. The sandwich wasn't horrible. It just wasn't good. The bread was pretty nice. Someone on here described the Mac and Cheese and being Krafty. To that I say, don't get your hopes up. Kraft is much better then their cheese sauce concoction. The loaded mashed potatoes were actually pretty good as was the sweet tea. I finished my meal with a complimentary cone. It was labeled ice cream, but don't get your hopes up. It's cold and has an appearance similar to ice cream, but it's definitely not ice cream.\n\nThe service was good, the place was clean and the prices were reasonable. I think it's a great place to take kiddos. I don't think I'd make an effort to go back, but I wouldn't be opposed to it if I had a coupon. Bon appetit."
2,Not impressed at all. I had high hopes and was really let down. Wicked spoon is way better. Nothing special at all here. Nothing was great and barely anything was good. Service wasn't even good. I will not be back.
2,"Pros:\n- Close to downtown and the belt line\n- Comfortable beds\n\nCons: \n- Breakfast is lousy and the lounge is not clean. You have to remind the lounge attendant when the food runs out. They are most certainly not attentive. \n- While they now have a coffee machine, a lot of times they run out of cups and surprisingly NEVER have any coffee cup sleeves. \n- Some of the front desk staff is downright rude. Most of them are good but I found some to be rather abrupt and unwelcoming. \n\nTo summarize, this is probably an ok hotel for the occasional traveler but if you are a business traveler and find yourself in a hotel 3 to 4 night every week then you will find this hotel severely lacking. \nHaving stayed at various Starwood & Marriott hotels around the country, I am very disappointed in their service."
2,I was fairly disappointed with this zoo. Signage was unclear. Many of the exhibits were on loan. The petting zoo consisted of a large pen of goats.
2,"We were looking at this place everyday and planing to try for the breakfast and, finally we get in to the place. nice staff and quick service got our attention. we had great tasting coffee and we took a order and i tried the chicken hash which is the most popular  consider to the waiter. Plates are pretty big and the bread is so hard and cant even taste that. all the food has no taste at all. i was surprised and add some hot souse and pepper and salt to  make my taste bud happier,. bad luck!!! i didnt like the food at all. i can't say anything good about food and we just had BLAH! breakfast. I still top the Black Bear Dinner is the best breakfast so far!!"
2,"I was surprised and relieved to find that Whisky River is not a shrine to Dale Earnhardt Jr. Still, it's a haven for his adoring middle-aged fans and very much a tourist trap. There is even a stand selling Whisky River T-shirts, hats and other merchandise. \n\nIf you're not into NASCAR, you definitely shouldn't go during a race, which dominates all 20 TVs in the bar. \n\nWhisky River is a private club, so if you're going for the first time, you'll have to go through the annoying process of waiting in line and filling out a membership form. You'll also have to pay a cover to get in.\n\nUnlike other EpiCentre hotspots, Whisky River's crowd isn't very dressed up. Most women wear jeans and halter tops; most guys wear jeans, collared shirts and baseball caps.  \n\nWith three large bars and several beer tubs, there are plenty of spots to get a drink in the smoky, packed bar. And I'll admit that watching people (mostly women) tackle the mechanical bull can be entertaining. \n\nA big plus is that it's right off the light rail."
2,"Came here for one night on business. The room is in bad need of being updated. It looks like an 80's bachelor pad. Complete with a red leather armless chair to a cheaply converted dresser into an entertainment center. It also has way to many mirrors, a bathroom counter that is to small for a hair brush, and no coffee maker. I also got a towel with a 6\"" hole in it. If this is remodeled and grander, don't expect MGM to survive much longer. I won't be back.\n\nPs...there is a hidden $25 fee that you won't see any where other than the fine print of your confirmation email."
2,"What do you do when you've had one sake too many and can't be bothered with a 90min bus ride home? Stumble into the closest hotel you can find! Which, in our case, was the Thistle King James Hotel. With only twin rooms left, it would have to do. \n\nFrom there on in, we passed out, on what I would term as gloriously hard mattresses, perfect for me, but hated by the boy. It was roasting hot, and we couldn't find the thermostat. Neither of which was a super big deal for me, but the fact that I felt I was lying next to the drunk roaring outside rather than being separated by concrete and 6 floors was a little more frustrating. I've lived downtown before, screaming police cars are not a big deal for me - but soundproofing was pretty handy, and the age of this building shows in it's lack thereof. The lady on the counter cheerfully advised us that it was due to be knocked down... to that I am not sure if I care particularly about, but at least if it is to continue in it's guise as a hotel (for a central hotel, surprisingly cheap... or maybe not that surprising) perhaps some soundproofing in rooms so I don't hear the *pop* of the champagne bottle next door next time...."
2,"Growing up in Tempe I always thought this was THE liquor store, mind you as a kid riding in the back seat of my parents station wagon. \n\nThey had the flashing lights on their sign, the awesome location, a drive through so you don't even have to get up out your car to get that bottle surrounded by a black plastic bag. \n\nWell when I became of age to purchase legally, I realized there is no reason to drive past 30 liquor stores (aka 4 miles in Tempe) to get to this one so I never went. \n\nGroupon enticed me in with their $20 for $40 deal on liquor. I finally went in and used it the other day and pretty much disappointment for a liquor store. These guys will be a-okay because they practically on the ASU campus, people will drive through on the way to a football game to grab their drinks, and again, ASU.\n\nIf you have a bit more time, go elsewhere because I felt like I was buying liquor in the lobby of a Las Vegas hotel with these prices. Otherwise, location, location, location."
2,Hard to tell which was colder: my beer or my burrito. The service was non-existent. And had to beg for chips and salsa. Skip this one.
2,I love Starbucks but this one is not so great. It's strange when there isn't a line and it's so LOUD that it's impossible to relax and/or get any homework done. It's always full of annoying kids. The only reason I keep going back is because it's literally 3 mins away from my place and the staff is super friendly and they usually do a good job making my coffee. They also have a nice outdoor seating area but I can never use it because it's usually too hot outside and lately it has been unusually cold. I really wish they had a drive-thru at this location!
2,I want to say food is good.  Please Do Not purchase any retail products!  I purchased a 80$ purse and used it for 1 week and a strap started coming apart.  I took it in a week later and was told all retail sales are final!  Sorry!!!  You can take it and get it fixed.  Wow!!
2,"Susihi was ok. Seemed not as fresh as other sushi places I have been to. Special/baked/deep fried rolls were below average in taste and quality. Service was good for the first fifteen/twenty minutes, but for some reason the waitresses and waiters completely stopped coming to our table. We would stare down the staff and I'd even motion them over and no response. If you want great service for half the time and below average sushi, this is the place for you."
2,"Ridiculously small portions for ridiculously high prices.  This is MEXICAN FOOD for gods sake!!!!  Do they realize how many knock-you-socks-off authentic Mexican food restaurants there are in the southwest???!!!!??  For a portion of the price!!!!  The pretty setting is a plus, but not THAT MUCH!"
2,"If you are looking for any type of Asian food, you are not going to find it here.  What you are going to find is slightly overpriced mediocre food next to CMU which makes it popular for no particular reason. \n\nI have tried the pho (really sad) and the rice with duck which was decent, but was not butchered well.  \n\nOverall if you need something in the CMU area you can do a lot better and the service could use improvement as well."
2,"I had an ok experience, it was during lunch on the weekend... not a lot of people inside and they had the games on but the TVs were blasting loud... couldnt enjoy conversation. I ordered the french dip, it was very greasy... the au ju appeared to be some form of a gravy. The tots were good.. nice and crunchy and not too salty. Its a ride from my house and not a place I would go out of the way to go to again."
2,"Ordered a Focaccia sandwich.  They said it was \""different\"".  Yes, it was different.  Nothing like focaccia bread.  More like a burrito or wrap.  Not good.  Sweet potato chips were bland.  Beer was cold.  Would try somewhere else next time."
2,"I have to admit, the first time I stepped in I was incredibly unimpressed.  It's big, they sell GIANT glasses of beer and the crowd is a bit too eclectic for even this guys tastes.  That's usually a recipe for disaster...  but for some reason this place is growing on me.  \n\nSure, it's not my favorite bar in madison.  It's not even in my top 20.  I wouldn't make this a weekend destination, but it fills that niche of  \""Hey, you wanna grab a beer?\""  Plus it's close to home.\n\nWeeknights are pretty quiet, you can sit and have a conversation and drink.  Sometimes that's all you need out of a bar.  \n\nThe Come Back is not good, it's definitely not bad... it just IS"
2,"Impressive wine list, but the service was a little apathetic, and very high prices for the quality of food.   Food was lukewarm when it arrived and the \""menu description\"" to \""product\"" ratio was pretty far off.  I essentially had a BBQ-sauced ham hock over far too buttery grits.  But I will say that the wild board meatballs were awesome.\n\nI think I just expected more."
2,"I want to like this place, I really do.  I can't get over 3 things:  1)  Their bbq is just OK.  Sauces are good (at least 4 stars), but the meat, by itself, just isn't that great.  Their sides are just OK, too.  Mashed sweet potatoes, potato salad, barbequed pinto beans, etc.....  just average.  Not really much flavor to anything I've ever had there (roughly 4-5 experiences).  Even their sweet tea is just OK - not bad, but not memorable in any way.  2)  Their prices are much higher than their competition.  If I'm going to pay this much, I want to eat Midwood Smokehouse or Mac's.  3)  It drives me nuts when restaurants weigh out portion sizes.  Especially BBQ joints.  Feels like I'm in a Subway.  I understand it's part of their business model to control portion sizes, but c'mon man!?!?!\n\nService is great.  The guys behind the counter are always helpful, fast, and fun to engage in conversation, but the food is average at best."
2,If you want ice cream with an attitude than enjoy. My two little girls can't and shouldn't eat a whole scoop of ice cream when I asked if I could get 1 scoop and a extra bowl and was told no- I will drive to cold stone down the street.
2,Just a little dive bar!  This is a spot that we used to head to for a few beers at the end of the night when I lived in the neighborhood.  There are a bunch of Native American's that frequent this establishment.\n\nThe best thing about Playa Bar is they will package up a few brews for you to take home with you.\n\nNot much to say about this old little hole in the wall.
2,"I've been here probably four times, mostly because I don't want to drive all the way to Spring Mtn. I felt compelled to write this review after my last and final visit. The service is as bad as everyone has mentioned. The owner/server does not greet you or smile. He will eventually make his way over and say \""ready?\"". He will never return until 20 minutes later when the soup comes out. I am pretty sure they dont have to make this to order. Soak the noodles, add the broth and rare beef and serve. It can come out in 5 minutes. While I waited I began to notice the mini-blinds were so dirty and then I started wondering what else was dirty. When the large bowl of pho I ordered to share with my youngest arrived, it had like 4 slices of beef. I asked the owner if this was right since I ordered a large. He says that is normal. No attempts to fix it. Well I won't be returning and the food is just meh!"
2,good service & clean but food was sub par.  we were disappointed & would prefer other cafes in the area over this one.  pancake were OK but potatoes and corn beef hash were dry & flavorless.
2,"Over priced and the food is blah, the only thing that I found good on the menu was the choco taco, and those can be picked up for a couple of bucks at any convenience store."
2,"WHen I started going here it was pretty good.   Two of the ladies there did a good job Than I started getting this older guy and woman and I'd find that I'd go in for a fill in and it would last maybe a week where I used to be able to go for 2 to 3 week.  I'm sure my nails haven't suddenly started growing faster.  My nails also started lifting after a few days.  He just doesn't do a very good job and not being one who can make an appointment, I kinda gotta take what I get.  If I knew I was going to get either of the 2 ladies that I used to get in the beginning I would go back there everytime but I keep getting stuck with the guy so I just don't think it's worth the gamble anymore.  Time to find a more consistant salon and also one that appreciates the year round resident over the snowbird."
2,Okay I've been here numerous times before always for oysters but we went the past weekend for the pan roast and it was two thumbs down. The broth was sweet for some reason and just not good. Go for the oysters but that's all.
2,"Imagine... you are on a diet for about 2 weeks and you've lost a significant amount of weight.\n\nNow, you're on vacation with your girlfriends and you don't wanna be a party pooper  or the stupid downer on a diet so you decide to have a HUGE cheat meal and enjoy really good food with good company, possibly undoing 2 weeks' worth of starvation. \n\nAfter much deliberation, you decide on a buffet, wait two hours in line and pay $40 upon entering the restaurant to have what you think will be one of the tastiest meals of your life (considering you haven't eaten any real food for the past 13 days).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nI was UTTERLY DISAPPOINTED in their food selections... or lack thereof.  \nI kept walking around the buffet with my plate hoping that more variety of food would magically appear.\nI wanted sushi so I stood in line in the \""rolls\"" section to no avail. \n...just some sad looking California rolls that consisted of like 90% rice.\n\nSADNESS\n\nOther than the king crab legs, the best thing there was either the scrambled eggs or pesto mashed potatoes.\n\nTo come out of a buffet and say that their scrambled eggs were one of the best items they offered... is just really really sad."
2,"Stereo is the sort of place that you go to aged 18 on Wednesday night because you haven't yet discovered GHQ's legendary night 'Movida' or an equivalent.  It's seriously cheap which is a bonus and entry is often free.  This, combined with \u00a31 vodkas, makes for a very cheap and extremely drunken night.\nThe decor feels a bit tired and the layout is pretty boring with a long bar and dancefloor just behind it.  Their night 'Shagtag' achieved the seemingly impossible by being even tackier than its name suggested.  You basically get a sticker with a number and if anyone fancies a bit of you then they write your number on the board next to theirs.  It's a pretty vulgar concept which sets the scene for a sleazy night to come.  \nMost people have their day with Stereo as it offers little if you're after a well rounded night out."
2,"I want this review to have more stars.. but i just can't give them. \n\nFirst time we went there, what a delightful local diner. Comfortable, great service, decent food. Every other time we've been there has been a fail (5-7 times), filled with iffy food and very (very) subpar service.. Why go back? Not sure. I guess we haven't in a month or so. Much rather spend our eating out dollars and a place that rarely disappoints (Atlantis Taverna!!)"
2,I only go here when I know exactly what I want so I dont have to try and ask an employee for help. 1 out of 10 of there employees actually knows something. Sometimes this place is just so fustrating. Customer service sucks.\n\nBut when I do find something I want it is a really good price.
2,Service was overall lacking.  Staff was generally rude/unhelpful/incompetent.\n\nThe suite rooms were nice looking but kind of cheesy and the couch in the sunken living room was kind of gross (like it seemed impossible to clean).  \n\nThe casino was not as nice as other hotels but not as cheesy as others.\n\nKind of middle of the road hotel (which for the price seems like it should be better) with bad service.  \n\nPool was okay--crowded not refreshing and slow pool service.\n\nWriting this review has been sad.
2,"We went here on a recent visit to Madison with our kids after riding the Polar Express train.  If you're not a fan of clowns and circus stuff surounding you at every turn, don't go here.  If you are looking for outstanding food, don't go here either.  After paging through the 30 page binder they call their menu, our table had a Chicago style hot dog, meatloaf and mashed potatoes, a cheeseburger, a reuben sandwich and some soup.......  We all said the same thing after we left, \""well that was a disappointment\"".\n\nThe kids really enjoyed themselves and ate most of their chicken tenders, I guess I haven't indoctrinated them enough yet into the belief that clowns and circus memorabilia  is evil.  Seriously, this may be a good place for desert and a quick look with the kids.  If you are looking for a great meal, keep looking."
2,"This restaurant is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and was the one restaurant that I had not been to. So after some shopping at one of the shops, we stepped in to have dinner.\n\nWe stepped in and asked for a seat for two. We were seated immediately. The place was decorated nicely and a lady playing the piano made for great ambiance.\n\nWe looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks, an appetizer, a soup and two main dishes. The drinks came out promptly and so did the rest of the meal. My goodness everything we ordered was very tasty.\n\nThe waiter service itself however was not even close to the decor and food. He never introduced himself, and although he took our order, our food itself was brought out by a kitchen person.\n\nAfter we ordered our waiter really never came back asking if we needed anything else, except to give us our check at the end and that was after the person I was dining with got up and asked a different waiter for it.\n\nIt's amazing how a place with great food, decor, and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service."
2,"I understand everyone's excitement about the art festival, but I think yes, while the  stuff was unique, it just seemed like a giant craft fair. I like the atmosphere of festivals but this was not what I was looking for. It was a bit of a letdown, after my friend and I quickly rushed through the festival we went to the arcade and spent most of our money there. I think the festival would have been more fun if I were 10 years younger.  \n\nIt's hard to find parking when the festival is in town so I'd recommend biking if you can. You could even park farther away and walk it. \n\nThere were a lot of talented people there but nothing that blew me away."
2,"The staff were very nice, and try to help when they get the time, however this is a very busy place, so getting hold of a member of staff can take some time.\n\nDisabled access could be MUCH better, and even on the wettest and coldest of days, they do try and encourage wheelchair users to eat outside as the staff freely accepted that there wasn't much space.\n\nThe fish is NOT fresh, but frozen, nothing better than what you could get in a supermarket but at a fraction of the cost. \u00a312.25 for frozen fish and \""fries\"" is just a bit extortionate. However my partner had a freshly made Pizza which she thoroughly enjoyed. The food can be a bit greasy, and while we were there, several customers had complained about the same thing.\n\nThere does seem to be a drastic lack of management. I was determined not to sit outside in minus 1C, so when I asked to speak to a member of management about this, I was told one would be right with me. Still nothing after a 45 minute wait!!!\n\nThere are far more accessible places, with better management, and far better food, even the chip shop opposite serves MUCH better fish and chips and at half the price.\n\nThis is one place I won't be returning to in a hurry"
2,I am ok with $7.50 warm beers as long as there is a professional sports event in front of me.... The only event that I witnessed was the surprise on everyone's face when they saw how small the portions were!!  I do like the uniforms though.... Reminded me that my car was due for an oil change!!
2,"MR says ... if I've known I'm going to get beaten up...\n\nMRS says ... we went here to get a foot massage. After a long day of walking Vegas strip, we figure, a good massage will ease up our tired aching feet. This place offers not just foot massages but body. Sure nice to have a body massage but our experience was horrible with the masseuse. She was rubbing my head so hard that I feel like my thinning hair is getting abuse and got me worried that I'm walking out of this foot spa already bald.\n\nAs for the actual massage, it was painful. The masseuse lady must be using same strength or force on all of her customers because she didn't even bother to ask if I want it harder or extra pressure points. \n\nWe were hoping for a foot massage but gotten a beating. It was more of a body massage than foot reflexology. Will consider other massage place in the area as there are TONS of them out there. So many to choose from. Unfortunately we ended up here because they're just $20 an hour and they're open late. \n\nLesson learn not to get caught up with the $20 deal ... it's too good to be true!!!"
2,"Been going to Mr. Lucky's for years.  Had the gamblers special.  The shrimp, salad, and potatos were very good.  The quality of the steak has gone downhill.  Disappointed."
2,"Sigh why does everyone like Antonio's so much?  Thin crust = yuck.  Toppings = all oil.  Ingredient freshness = questionable.  Price = (2)*(As expensive as it should be considering the previously implied high oil:crust thickness ratio).  Maybe I just enjoy getting sleazed on by the pizza slicers less than the average Antonio's patron?\n\nThe only redeeming quality of this place is the outlandish variety of toppings:  tortellini, tortilla chips, blue cheese, steak, bacon, you name it, they will cover it in oil and leer at you while they slice it up for you."
2,"If you're a foodie like me, you will NOT be impressed by Hillside Spot. My boyfriend and I came here a couple of weeks ago for a quick lunch after a trip to Ikea. We ordered the Blue Sky burger and a salad/sandwich combo. Let me just say the chopped salad was delicious--but then again how can you go wrong if you use fresh ingredients? The grilled veggie sandwich, however was DIS-GUSTING. The veggies were sopping in oil/grease and were put on the driest piece of bread I've ever had. I couldn't believe that's what they considered the healthy option. The Blue Sky burger was no better...but then again we wouldn't know because the only flavor you could taste was the blue cheese. This place was the biggest disappointment in a long time.\n\nOverall, even with three and a half stars this place is overrated. Just sayin."
2,"Been a four day a week customer of Yogurtland for months. Great place, friendly employees, excellent selection. Decided to try agave out of curiosity. First time there I got the cake batter yogurt and absolutely loved it. I thought this might be my next favorite place. Went the next day and poof! Cake batter was gone. Unlike yogurtland which always has the flavors I like, this place swaps them out daily. I was impressed when the cashier said he had wifi and even provided 15 different cables to charge various devices. My iPhone was almost dead so I asked if he could get me an iPhone charger. Guess what? He didnt have one. Are you kidding? The best device in the world and he has every charger but that one? Also, very pricey. Yogurtland is 8 cents per ounce cheaper. With a family of five that adds up."
2,"We went here tonight for dinner, and the whole experience was just a notch above median. We picked this place through Yelp, and though we cook Indian food (I'm Indian) at least 3 days a week, sometimes we crave for restaurant Indian food. We ordered the mixed grill plate for appetizers and chicken tikka masala and naan for the main course. The mixed grill plate comprised of kabobs (both seekh and tikkas of chicken, lamb and beef) laid on a THICK bed of sauteed onions and a couple of lemon wedges. It arrived sizzling hot, and several people turned their heads to see where that szzzzz sound was coming from!  I dug into it with my mouth salivating in expectation, but it was a rude shock. The chicken was dry to the mouth. The seekh kabobs were overpowered with spices (mainly red pepper), and the quantity--so abysmal! The bed of onions probably weighed more in quantity than the meat. The tikkas were standard fare...oily and spicy gravy, with cubed pieces of chicken. The place is good for students, because it's so close to ASU, but otherwise, I don't think I will go back there again!"
2,"This place was a let down.  I was expecting something better and exciting especially because the logo and branding seemed to infer fun, traditional italian cuisine.  Not even close.  Oh my,  I miss Italian Food from the New York.  And definitely don't order to pick up.  They obviously don't use heat lamps as everything was cold when we picked up our phone order - and we arrived only 15 minutes after ordering - when they said it would be ready. :-("
2,"Wow, what an experience. I think this hotel opened prematurely, especially w/ 4000 rooms. We did not find one person checking out that had a satisfactory experience.  Our check-in was a nightmare - didn't get into our room until after 7pm. They couldn't put us on same floor as our other 2 parties.  One friend never got room service.  Ours didn't come until 5pm. Hairs in sink. Toilet dirty. Check-in clerks less than accommodating. Did have a great check-out experience, although I scanned all the agents to see who seemed the most pleasant. They are aware of their shortcomings and are trying to improve, but unfortunately for Aria, most guests will probably not return. Of the 3 guests in line, none were happy and all received some sort of compensation.  Not good.  Hotel restaurants were good though.  Decor is dark. Rather stay at Bellagio, Wynn or Venetian. This hotel needs a lot of work."
2,"I hate writing negative reviews, but this place truly is a glorified Outback Steakhouse.\n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered the Wagyu Filet and it tasted like a regular filet from Outback! Even now, my boyfriend swears they gave us a regular filet instead of the Wagyu...he could be right!\n\nWe spent over $400 on dinner, including wine, dessert and an appetizer. However, it was not satisfying. We easily spend hundreds of dollars on meals because of the experience we're getting, but this was truly not worth it. \n\nThe bone marrow was good, but I just couldn't stomach eating a $72 filet that tasted mediocre at best. The highlight of our meal was the duck fat fries with white truffle oil infused dipping sauce, the wonderful piece of cauliflower that accompanied my phony filet and the Darjeeling tea (this was outstanding).\n\nI think we'll be trying Jean Georges steak house at the Aria next time. Apparently the Wagyu beef is phenomenal there...and legit!"
2,"They're really slipping now.  With dinner, you get cole slaw - you can \""upgrade\"" to soup or salad for 2.50 more.  Really?  I've never heard of cole slaw being a pre-meal before.  I got the French Onion Soup, its actually better at Mimi's.  They put way too much cheese, the bread is pathetic and there's hardly any onions in it.\n\nThe prime rib comes with horseradish - very weak and cut with butter.  Never heard of that before either.  Luckily I had some sour cream with my baked potato and I asked for some raw horseradish so I can concoct my own.  Wasn't the best, but way better than the butter!  \n\nThe barbeque chicken was ok.  I've had better at diners.  They didn't really season the bird, just threw some barbeque sauce on it.  At least it wasn't terribly dry...\n\nI don't think I'm coming back to this one.  Nooooo.."
2,"The store has a decent selection but the staff is not friendly at all.  I walked in and was not greeted even though there was no one else in the store and the associates were standing by the cash register, not far from the door.  They were more concerned with whispering to each other as I looked at the various merchandise.  I actually felt uncomfortable being in there.  It's not good when you go to a store and the sales associates make you want to leave.  Maybe that's why it was so quiet at the height of the shopping season."
2,"St. Francis, we live in a loud world and I thought the idea of having a delicious brunch, with an equally yummy Bloody Mary, was really appealing. The food is good and the service is getting sooooo much better but what is the deal with the Jazz trio IN the restaurant???  Seriously, we couldn't even hear ourselves talk!!!  You have to figure out what you're going to be during the weekends and I don't think Jazz Club is going to do you any favors.  I really need & want a relaxed environment so will just go down the street from now on."
2,"food here was good. ate the chow mein, calamari, wasabi octopus, and a roll. this would have been a better review but they ruined our dinnner. in the middle of our meal they asked us to move to another table in order to make room for someone else. that just ruined the rest of the dinner and ruined our appetite."
2,I went to this nail salon on Sat 5/18/13 during my visit to Vegas. I'm kinda disappointed in the service I received. Don't get me wrong. The staff was friendly.   The person who did my pedicure was ok. She was more dormant than anything. I didn't get what I thought I would receive from a pedicure. I guess I'm use to creativity for paying $30 for a pedicure and a tip.The samples they provided were outdated and boring. \n\nOverall the experience wasn't my worst but definitely not in my top ten. I'm normally all about second chances but I'm gonna have to override that rule of thumb for this situation.
2,"The burgers were good and the meat they use is great. However, that being said, the fact that you get a burger, only a burger, and nothing but the burger for the money bugs! Any \""sides\"" cost extra. The day we were there it was also VERY SLOW! On a Saturday afternoon, during the lunch hour, they had one person working the register taking orders with a line out the door and shouting, (while she took orders) \""Welcome to Smash Burger\"" or \""Thanks for coming to Smash Burger\"" every time the door opened for people to come in or to leave. We had the kids with us and the waiting time was insane not only to order, but also to get our food. Not a good place to take young children when you need to be in and out with hungry children with short attention spans. Probably won't be going back when we can get faster service and more food for the money elsewhere."
2,"I've been here a few times -- it's ok.  Convenient to my work and the happy hour prices are decent.  The house marg is ok  but kinda small and with LOTS of ice.  The happy hour bar food was ok - nothing special.\n\nThe outdoor seating (when the weather is nice) is ok - it faces a parking lot, as does most outdoor seating in AZ.  Also when the weather is accommodating, they open the bar doors to the outside which gives it a cute look / feel. \n\nOverall - it's just ok. The food is pretty basic and if i used a toaster oven for my costco chimis / flautas - it would be the same."
2,"Wow, getting through security gets worse every time I go.  Last time I went the guy that was looking at the luggage kept passing a piece of luggage through the xray back and forth for 10 minutes, then called over another guy.  They proceeded to have water cooler talk, while the rest of us waited in line, probably remembered that they should be working, went back to examining this same piece of luggage for an additional 10 minutes!! How about we just open the darn thing up if it's going to take so freaking long!\n\nAnd,Terminal B, with your ridiculous non-signage, you say gates 1-21 are down a corridor, but fail to tell people that once the numbers get to 11 on one side, they start going up on the other side!  So to get to gate 3, you don't have to go all the way down to the end, because the numbers don't drop off.\n\nThis place just keeps getting worse and worse.  \n\nPS- 1 of my friends waited 20 minutes in the Starbucks line (in Terminal B)."
2,"Well right off the bat the place looks really cool, low walls at the entrance so it already feels like your in the bar, good music, some awesome artwork, and huge TV's everywhere. The problem I have is when you pay $19 for 2 vodka redbulls, which by the way WTF I could by my own bottle of vodka for that, I wouldn't expect my feet to be stuck to the floor... literally almost lost my shoes 3 times. How is it opening week/weekend and the place seemed just dirty?  That makes no sense. Well regardless of the good stuff, I couldn't justify paying another $20 for 2 more drinks while loosing my shoes so we left after about a half hour. In all honesty the place has great potential but with prices like that your only attracting a certain type of people...  Scottsdale dbags."
2,"I heard from my coworkers this place was very good & cheap. \n\nWell, they were partially right. I mean prices are reasonably & portions are fair. As far as the food goes, it's not all that great. \n\nStarting off with chips & salsa weren't that good. Too thin no salt and la salsa was too watered down. A coworker was very unsatisfied with his coctel de camaron. He said it tasted like they added Louisiana hot sauce. \n\nIf anything, la agua de horchata was amazing, and the service was great."
2,"At least I have something to compare Mexican meals to as this was the worst mexican meal I've ever had. Ordered a basic dish: beef enchiladas. Tasted like salt with a side of enchiladas, rice, and beans. Not fresh, plasticky and too salty, I barely had a few bites. Even the salsa at this place was overly salty and had too much garlic. The dish aside, the server was genuinely concerned that I didn't eat anything and promised to alert the kitchen. Although we promised to go back for another try, we lied. There are way better options in the QC!"
2,"My 2 stars are for the pleasant demeanor of the person who took our order.\nThe food was below expectations. We ordered the bhindi masala which had absolutely no salt, yellow daal which wasn't good either. The chicken Tikka masala was eatable though.\nAlso we ordered laccha paratha hoping to eat laccha paratha but it looked and tasted like butter nan.\nAlso the service was extremely slow.\n\nOverall a disappointing experience. I would definately not recommend this place to anyone."
2,"Go near this place frequently but never tried until today. Ordered a very simple salad with added grilled chicken. Waited about 15 minutes for the salad (to go). The chicken was cold - I expected warm for the 15 minute wait, there were 4 simple ingredients and it cost $ 10.90.  They also forgot to give me the $2.00 tea I ordered. Maybe I just caught them on a bad day...it is Monday...but probably won't go back."
2,"The design of the restaurant is very winning. I love the metal Buddha entrance way. It is a seriously cool looking place to eat.\n\nBUT ... and this is a freaking ginormous BUT ... the prices for what you get at China Poblano are downright ridiculous. Although above average on taste and presentation, the foods themselves do not merit the prices they charge.\n\n$12 for 4 \""When Pigs Fly\"" which are basically roast pork buns. The dough is very light and the filling is tasteful. BUT it is SPARSE. There was barely any actual filling in the bun. Ludicrous.\n\nA typical roast pork bun costs $1.50 at a Chinese bakery on Spring Mountain and it is FILLED with roast pork.\n\nGo. Go yourself and see. It is like a FREAK show. The most freakishly priced DIM SUM you have every seen. Then go to a normal Chinese restaurant and get five times the amount of food for the same amount of money."
2,"Had my nails done here for my wedding. Painting was a bit messy but I thought it would clean up when I washes my hands. The girl was really nice and fun but although my nails were shiny, the coat didn't even last the day, the nail varnish was running out, I think it was just thinned out too much! Very expensive for what it was, would recommend doing your own nails, i think i could've done better personally.\n\nI wouldn't go there again for my nails."
2,"I always think I'm going to love this place, but then when I'm actually there it's just not that great. \n\nGood for groups, though, because the tables turn over pretty fast."
2,"This is from a vegetarian visiting so take this with a grain of salt.  I stopped by to try the veggie burger since I was craving some onion rings.  Their veggie burger comes super vegetabled-out with sprouts and cucumbers even as a vegetarian I'm not that big of a fan of cucumbers and sprouts on a burger so I got it with cheese and left off the previously mentioned.  It was pretty dry and over cooked as veggie burgers go with nothing special going on.  If restaurant  is going to have one on the menu at least try to make it better than the freezer section ones.  They must be doing well though I had to wait a really long time for my food even on off hours.  They were busy but they didn't seem slammed for the wait I had.  The onion rings were kinda greasy and the breading was falling off so the main reason I came was a bummer as well.\n\nThey might be good for the carnivores, but I would skip it if you are a vegetarian and want a burger fix."
2,"Flashback around 10 years ago. My first trip to Vegas. Imagine the amazement of this place and what was going to await me when I get to the Strip. Amazed at how the airport looked with the flashing lights and marquees and the slot machines going off. \n\nFlashforward to now after a few more trips and to this week, my latest trip there. The place needs a new overhall. They spent a shitload of money on the new City Center in Vegas on the strip but they can't seem to spend money on the airport, which looks the same and still has the same everything that this place had when I first started going to Vegas. Seriously, change things up a little. Make it more pleasing to the eyes. Hell, a new paint job would do wonders! Not really asking for an SFO type overhall. Just update the place a little. Please?"
2,"Overall good pizza, but extremely expensive. Their pepperoni specialty pizza is $15.95 for a small 12 inches! Add one extra topping, and now you're up to about $20 for a personal-sized pizza. On top of that, their payment system asks for a tip up front.  An up-front request for a tip always feels a little awkward to me. Also, I'm not sure what I'm tipping for, there isn't much service to actually tip for.  The pizza is dropped off at your table. Napkins? Plates? Condiments? Red pepper? All kept at the bar area.  Leave all your stuff alone on the table, trek back up to the bar, and get it all yourself. You are also expected to bus your own table. \n\nThe rest of the choices there are good, including their salads and sandwiches. All still very pricey. \n\nConclusion: good food, but you pay thru the nose for it. Is their pizza 3x as good as Fuel? Definitely not."
2,TOO MUCH SMOKE IN THE POKER ROOM....Poker room is too small and lame.  There is too much smoke drifting in from the slot area
2,"I went to lunch today with my family and hadn't been to this location in some time. The table had a sticky residue around the perimeter that was really unpleasant. I looked out the window and immediately saw 4 flies on the inside folks. I look down and the window sill was dirty and the white shudders were equally grimy. \n\nI ordered an iced tea wondering if I could talk my family into going somewhere else. Nope auntie wanted pie. The iced tea was not brewed. Dissaponting. I ordered the potato soup, meatball sliders and double cream lemon pie. \n\nThe soup was creamy and delicious as always. Yay! The meatball sliders, were just ok. The onions were caramelized nicely but the meatloaf was sort of grainy. If you have had mre meatloaf, it was like that. You get two, I sent one home. The pie was awesome with the tart lemon filling and lemon cream. The crust was nice and flakey.\n\nTake some time, clean your restaurant and go back to brewed iced tea. You do so well with the tired and true recipes, the meatloaf was just meh. I really hate giving you a two star but the cleanliness and the tea just really turned me off."
2,"Slllllllllllllllllllllllllloooooooooooooowwwwwww.\n\nService is generally friendly, but is it worth the wasted gas idling in the drive thru and the potential that they will mess your order up 25 percent of the time?"
2,"I plan on contacting these people tomorrow about replacing the apple I bought from them.  The apple people completely downloaded a new operating system for me and I still can't open Hotmail, gmail, Utube etc.  Everything is okay if you don't have to sign in to anything.  The people at the Apple store have said they have never seen anything quite like it.  I will fill you in on what the Do.  If they aren't willing to work with me, I intend to contact  University president, the BBB, And one of the television stations that helps with things like this.\n\nAt this point for anything more than furniture or small office supplies, I say AYOR."
2,"Ordered chicken lo mein lunch special, took quite a while to receive it...but it was pork. Quite a conversation getting it changed. Pork and chicken were both chewy and overcooked, no seasoning whatsoever. Lo mein was ok, but had a strange oily aftertaste. Egg drop soup also had no seasoning. Egg roll was very strange tasting...couldn't really identify what was inside even after breaking it apart (I was told it was carrot mostly). Red sweet/sour sauce was oddly spicy, but not bad. I had been in this place twice before and was underwhelmed with the food, although the service was excellent and the lunch prices were reasonable. I like to support local businesses, but definitely wont go back, even though it is close to my home."
2,Went with my boyfriend for a few after dinner drinks and was a bit disappointed. The place was packed but the 2 bartenders were more concerned about talking to their friend or the regulars. The service was extremely slow.
2,"Way overpriced. I paid just about $21 for a burger basket, an order of cheese curds, bottled water, and two custard cones. Not even worth the price!!!!Culvers would have been a better option. the food was ok, but I suppose the custard was good."
2,Found a big piece of glass in my husband's lemon filled powdered donut this morning. \nThis is our go to store for donuts..they make them from scratch. \nThey are usually great... He swallowed some of it...I took it and the piece of glass back to the store and showed it to the Bakery Manager and I said I would take all the lemon donuts off the shelf....the store manager refunded my money.\nwhen I was leaving. . I noticed the lemon filled donuts were still on the shelf. ..\n\nBuyer beware...
2,"Oh, Lakeside, what happened?\n\nThis used to be my absolute favorite yarn shop in Madison. Then they got bought by the people who run The Knitting Tree (which was my least favorite as they were always rude and unhelpful). I recently visited Wisconsin to see my family and was super excited to get into Lakeside as I didn't have the chance at Christmas. \n\nI was so so so sad.\n\nThe wall o'Cascade 220 is gone. ANY yarn in the coffeeshop room is gone. And what yarn was there was so sparingly spread out across the shop that it was just pathetic. The remodel job opens the space up a bit, but with an open space, it's even more obvious that the stock is so sadly low and it's nothing at all like the Lakeside of old. I miss sitting with my cheese sandwich and staring at the Cascade wall, plotting new projects. \n\nNo one greeted me. No one asked if they could help. And when I headed for the door (after a few minutes of searching to see if the things I used to know I could get there still existed), no one even blinked to see if they could be of help.\n\nIt's just pathetic now."
2,"A lot of older hotels on the strip have had renovations in attempt to keep up with newer chic hotels such as Aria and The Cosmopolitan. Tropicana made an effort, but fell short. \n\nService is unreasonably slow, both in receiving service and trying to reach it. A little over forty five minutes for room service to arrive with food. We had ordered appetizers and a rare burger. The food was on the colder end toward lukewarm. Had asked for towels and had them arrive after forty five minutes and a \""reminder call\"". Same sort of service at their Beach Club restaurant. The people are wonderfully nice though. \n\nI wouldn't return. Not for the service, or the tub that doesn't plug, or the shower head that doesn't stay, or the long walk to the room from any entrance.\u00a0It's just not worth the money. The room was okay at best.\n\nLots of older people as well, not that it was an issue, just a heads up."
2,"2.0 Stars.\n\nI understand price gouging at airports.\nBut $9.99 for a 6-8 inch burrito?\nIt was tasty, but it was no meal...merely a snack.\n\nI felt robbed. I had a 1 1/2 hour lay over.\nI should have walked around a little and asked if\nthere was a McDonald's in the airport.\n\nSURE ENOUGH...THERE IS !!!\n\nDon't spend your money here if you are really hungry."
2,"Service was slow. Ordered seafood platter; some cold, some raw. Sent back and they just reheated the plates.  Not good value."
2,"Too big. Unorganized chaos even if you are on a guest/bottle list. Go from one line to another, then back because no one knows what they are doing. VIP host kept the D&G tag on his suit.... Dude that's supposed to come off when you get that shit tailored, ultra douchey. PS get that shit tailored."
2,"Bad Experience!!! I loved the selection of cars they had. I went there yesterday to test drive a lexus is250 used. I fell in love with the car and would of bought it right then and there. But the sales associate Easton McIntosh was terrible!!! If you ever go there please see another sales associate! I have never felt that belittled ever by someone.If your buying a car you should never feel like that. One, its already a stressful situation buying a car. Second, to have the sales associate talk you down and belittle you is so unprofessional. At one point he said to me and my dad; \""Why are you even here if you cant afford the car.\"" HOW RUDE!!!! Tells you a lot about the company if they have people like that working for them. They were non negotiable. This is my first car and I had 50% cash down payment and he still wouldn't work with me. Ill find another car elsewhere and where they appreciate my business. To bad because I loved the car. If anyone on here knows of another sales associate at this dealership who is willing to work with you let me know, thank you!!"
2,"Dr. Anjali Iyengar is, to say the least, inexperienced. So much so I would call her green. She has no bedside manner and very little tact when interacting with patients and patient care givers or relatives. She has no understanding of compassion or empathy and her answers to your medical questions are textbook perfect. She lacks common sense, patient etiquette and in my opinion has no love or caring to share with her clients. I say clients because that is what she sees us as. Nothing more. If you don't mind being treated like a non-human and getting critical care from a very inexperienced doctor then she is perfect for you. If you are looking for someone who will treat you well with care and concern while sharing personal experience then please do yourself a favor and find another cancer doctor. This person will not give two thoughts about you beyond your office visits and she quite openly admits to not caring about patients or their caregivers. Push here a little bit for answers and see what she says to you ;)"
2,"I know gas stations are not 5 star service or expected the bathrooms to be sparkling but damn... We made a pit stop here since gas was .10 cheaper than the BP across the street and whew... I'm thinking we should have payed the difference... \n\nYou know those slasher/killer movies where people are about to get it in a run down gas station? Yep that's the status of the men's bathroom here... It's the kind of place in which if you gotta go... Well pray first then use plenty of hand washing techniques and hand sanitizer afterwords. The bathroom hadn't looked like it was cleaned in months, there was cigarette butts in the stalls and I'm sure the dude in the single toilet stall was giving birth to a small grizzly bear due to his natural and unnatural noises and remarks. \n\nThey do get a second star only due to the fact that they are cheaper than competitors but they seriously lack cleanliness. I would not advise the kiddo's to use the restroom here."
2,"So used to Love this place but not so much anymore......waitstaff SUCKS SOOOOOO BAD! It took 30 mins to get a drink from our waitress, no one ever came to take our empty food plates, she was too busy admiring herself at mirror. Horrible service the only reason I gave 2 star is because happy hour drink prices are good.  Sushi is sub par, it's just run down and staff thinks they're really special."
2,"The GE is overly-large and over-priced. Yes, I have seen the food same item at other neighborhood GE's for less. For those of us who like to \""shop the perimeter\"" of the grocery store (meaning where the real food lives), and for those of us who do not like their grocery store to feel like an airport, this store is not good. I realize I am in the minority, however. Most people want bigger, more, more expensive (if they notice). And they put up with a bad parking lot and long check out lines, too. \n\nHonestly, I prefer the (gasp) East Lib/ Shakespeare St. GE. I can always park right outside the door and have had no problems with the produce, the dairy items or the service."
2,"Pizza tasted ok, was pretty greasy despite me taking off excessive oil with a napkin, got the white pizza. 10 min later had to run to bathroom!! Actually in 3. Haven't eaten anything for 6 hrs before then. You may get sick, proceed with caution"
2,My partner had to make reservation to eat at this joint and it took him three attempts. It looks like a regular restaurant from the outside but it opens up as you go into the restaurant which was a little more pleasant. \n\nIt's very crowded and the servers continuously bump our chairs when they have plenty of space to walk around us. Overrated and this food can be purchase at any Thai restaurant. Not worth the hassle.
2,"Just got back from a dinner at Gypsy Cafe...Ok, one second..let me put down my Wendy's burger....that tells you how bad the experience was.  I had to stop and get fast food on the way home.  I really wanted to like this place.  I read the good reviews on here and the website had some good food on it...but alas, it was horrible.\n\nThe service while nice is very very very slow.  They have no sense of urgency.  We were in a party of four and the meal was so slowly paced that after about 35 minutes we still had not been asked what we wanted for main entrees.\n\nThe appetizers were ok, not wow, but not bad....\n\nThe salads were way over dressed with a watery dressing....\n\nThe entrees...here's where it gets interesting.  My meal was very very bland.  I got the fall harvest farfalle pasta.  It was tasteless.  I was looking around on our table for salt and pepper, but there was none.  At first I thought it was b/c the dish was nuclear hot, but I let it cool off and it was still bland and mushy.  I had all members of our party taste it and there was agreement that it was bland and had NO seasoning.  \n\nI must say that my dinning companions liked their meals, but no one was raving.\n\nThe slow pace of the service negated any positives I was willing to give this place based on my other diners' meals."
2,"I LOVE the interior of this place, its stunning! the lightning is perfect, huge bar, awesome furniture and so on... BUT the food is NOT up to pair unfortunately... if it wasn't for the poor food this place is 5 stars easily...  to bad! Even the simplest things like a decent cooked burger... sad and such a waste!"
2,"Still trying to figure out what the big deal is about this place.\n\nOnion rings were good, so I'll give them that.\n\nHad a foot long and a regular chili dog.\n\nFoot long was average pretty much in every way.  Bun was slightly stale and hard.\n\nChili dog was average.  Chili was below average.\n\nDiet Dr Pepper was more soda water than Dr Pepper.\n\nIf you measure all hot dogs on the planet on straight line continuum with the $1.50 Costco special being the mid point, I'm not sure this place measures up to the mid point.\n\nOne other thing...$12 bucks and change for a foot long, chili dog, onion rings and a soda...YIKES!!!\n\nBut then again, maybe I just don't get it.\n\n2.5 wasn't a choice, but 3 is to high."
2,Weird experience! Called and asked for a taxi to the airport. Arrival time to my house 15 min. The woman that answered the phone said they can't guarantee a time. I said ok then I will use a different company. Someone else called me back and said they would be there in 15 min. Keep in mind my house is literally five minutes away so I didn't consider this an unreasonable request. The guy showed up and didn't come up to the house to grab my bags and instead waited for me to bring everything down the drive way. I think that might have been because he had some kind of an issue. He was coughing and spitting phlegm all over the sidewalk. I got dropped off at the terminal but not in front of curb side so again had to drag my bags he didn't bother to take them over. I did make it to the airport in one piece and the fare was reasonable but I am only 15 min away. Can't wait for the city to build additional light rail stops! If I have to drag my bags I would rather do it for a quarter of the cost. Weird weird weird!
2,"Showed up for the Prime Ribs and was incredibly disappointed. I had to return it twice for being undercooked. I'm very specific with the wait staff. I always order my food a certain way. The chef was definitely NOT up to his game today. usually this place is spot on, but my food sucked. \nNaturally, management deducted some money from my check but I would've just preferred  some quality food."
2,"We previously had a wonderful dim sum brunch, but our dinner this evening proved to be disappointing.  Service this evening was beyond slow so I called over the manager and explained we had a show to catch and could she call over a waitress.  She literally called across the room and a waitress soon appeared.   We gave our orders, Singapore noodles and wrinkled green beans, while advising of her of our evening's plans.  Our green beans arrived, but some 10 minutes later we were still waiting for the noodles.  I again called over the manager who called over the waitress who checked with the chef and said it would be a few more minutes.  Both dishes were decent, but it would have been nice to enjoy them together"
2,"Overall the food was decent. I had a mix of both sushi and appetizers. Not the best quality of sushi I've had, but not the worst either.\n\nThe one part I couldn't get over was the service. HORRIBLE SERVICE. It doesn't matter if the food is amazing or not, the thing that restaurants are supposed to sell is the whole experience. This was definitely not the best experience. We had to ask our server for things multiple times and they took forever to get us what we needed. There was only a few tables at the restaurant too, so definitely  no excuse for the bad service. \n\nMy advice: GET THE FOOD TO-GO!"
2,Our family took us here for dinner. The food was edible. It was really empty when we were there. The service was great!
2,"I'll keep this short and sweet.\n\nEight bucks for a chicken pita with lots of chicken and absolutely no flavor whatsoever.  I mean, no flavor at all.\n\nThe place is mysteriously crowded.  I honestly can't imagine why.\n\nThis is McDonalds for people who don't want to feel like they are walking into a McDonalds. Like McDonalds, it's also a national chain, so I'm not sure why people are saying it's \""locally owned,\"" or at least any more locally owned than your local McDonalds.\n\nhttp://www.zoeskitchen.com/menu.asp"
2,"After passing by the place several times I decided to try it and I drug my sister along.  The decor is great, but unfortunately that is the only great thing about it.  The staff was o.k., but seemed rushed.  Now to the reason why it only got two stars from me.  The food!  I did not like the food at all.  I got the hangover omelet and the egg was puffy it reminded me of a fast food egg.  My sister got the coney and she did not like it at all.  She said the chili was horrible so was the dog.  We didn't finish our meals we paid and left.  I know that this place is known for it's dessert's maybe that's where I went wrong, but the food is not great at all."
2,Always had good service. Guys were helpful and knowledgeable. Then  I sold my old equipment for store credit plus 10% of my total purchase ( I doubled checked) I was thinking it was a good deal. I should have taken the cash. When I returned to purchase a lens I was told that the 10% was already added to my store credit and that's why I got $55 instead of $50 in store credit. How does that make sense? I was disappointed since I had watched a few people get their store credit plus 10% of their purchases. Made me feel like they were falsely advertising their buy back event so that people would spend money at their store.
2,"This was my first year attending the Festival of India in Charlotte. To me it was lackluster and too expensive. I have been to other cultural festivals in the area that were less expensive and more fun. \n\n$5 for parking. $5 to enter inside...don't waste your money as there is dancing, music, food, and items for purchase on the street. FYI Henna tattoos are inside but costs another $5. The Henna work I paid for was only done on one finger and was sloppy. I dished out too much money at this festival and won't be returning next year. I'll just go eat at an Indian restaurant instead!"
2,"Poor excuse for an airport. Location makes it prone to high winds, and thus delays. \n\nThe place is pretty filthy as well. \n\nI had to make a connection here. Due to delays I had to run to the gate. Directions to the gate were nonexistent. I had to breathlessly ask an airline attendant for help. Well, after i kind of figured out where to go, i realized that this was the worst setup ever. i had to go through unmarked doors, down stairs, and wait on what looked like a loading dock for a shuttle bus to take me to the correct gate. what?"
2,Small. Crowded. Cover charge. No seating. Customers were hotter than the help.\n\nBut if you like rock and country karaoke with spendy weak drinks both served up by cute but not hot bartenders. This is your place.\n\nLittle or no fair comparison to the original in NY. Same can be said of the rest of NYNY-Vegas.
2,"I will say the best part about the whole place is the Apple store, biggest one I have seen thus far. However, getting into the place and parking is a nightmare. Either there is too little of it on the sides or most of it is valet parking only. The place is like a little village of shopping. Just too far of a drive and it didn't leave enough impression to make the drive worthwhile. I can't see how this place can be very popular during the summertime seeing as it is outdoor shopping."
2,"Saw the excalibur show - EXCELLENT.  The horse appeared in excellent condition.\n\nHowever the casino was nasty dirty.  Please consider hiring some folks to wipe down and clean up, did not want to touch the doors/windows."
2,"This review is from their drive thru menu. Be careful to really look closely at this chaotic display of a menu, you may think that something is one price and its actually another. \nThe items and prices are so close together in and in different sizing it looks like they just slapped updates up there and hoped everyone would figure it out. \nI figured out I had made a mistake when I ended up at the window paying 5 bucks for a taro boba....with whipped cream that I wasn't given an option to decline (I hate whipped cream on drinks.) When I was completely caught off guard by the receipt handed to me, because the attended didn't let me know the cost before charging me and I stupidly had not realized that I hadn't followed their menu since everything was close enough to be mistaken for another price or item on there. I spoke up and asked about it, the attendant was rude about it. The boba was cooked well, however not enough of a pull for me to pay more and have to deal with rude service/chaotic menu. Eh. Another for the DNR list."
2,"I don't get it , you have to make an appointment to get a drink , The bartenders (3) make you feel like they are doing you a favor by serving you and just stand around looking dis interested .\nThe service downstairs is better ,but the food is blaaa and very slow from the kitchen .\nNow the worst part , the price , its ridiculous $35/40 for overcooked oily food .\nArnold \"" I won't be back\"" \nPs , it smells ........."
2,"So disappointed with the changes at Hilldale.  Why would you want to make a mall outside in Madison WI? I used to love being able to browse in small shops without worrying about the weather. Sadly, many of the small shops that I enjoyed have moved or gone out of business.  \nIt feels like a ghost town now."
2,"The pizza was amazing but the service was terrible!  We were here on a Sunday around 2 pm and the young ladies working behind the counter were anything but friendly.  They all looked like they were on drugs, they barely smiled, they didn't explain anything to us even after we shared this was our first time, and numerous people complained about the service while we ate.  Even though the food was great, we will not be back because of the employees."
2,"Only 2 reviews for a McDonalds, hmmm...make it 3!\n\nLet's just say, not the best.  I've been 4+ times to this location.  3 of the 4 times, they had my order wrong.  Once, when ordering chicken mcnuggets via the Drive-thru, they asked me to pull around the corner and park...and they would bring it out to me.  I waited 20 minutes!  \n\nOn a positive note, if you order and decide to eat there, the inside is actually pretty big and kept clean.  It's also offstrip and has easy parking.  \n\nP.S. In-and-Out is just one more block up the street!"
2,Over rated...crotchety owner...needs an attitude adjustment.  Friendliness is not an attribute.  The pizza was burned in a few places and the taste was okay - nothing to write home about (and yes...my home is New York).  The wit is not worth it - neither is the food or the tude.
2,"So I tried this place out this past weekend. \n\nThe host greeted us,  not the most friendly older gentleman who told us while pointing where to sit & apparently couldn't walk us to our table nor hand is menus.\nWe waited patiently for a server to come to our table. Server finally came,  my friend & I ordered 2 cosmopolitans. When we got our drinks ...we took a sip of our drinks. .. looked at each other & knew we couldn't drink these drinks. .. just awful tasting. Can't even tell you what was wrong because they tasted just rotten.\nOrdered an appetizer & asked if we could have new drinks. .. wine instead as we figured that'd be safer. Server was quick to say sure & scampered off to the bar. .. we then watched as our server mocked us to the bartender ... we know this because we could SEE her & could hear it. Lucky for us no spit. Lol. Comes back, we have our wine.  Appetizer came shortly afterwards. The food was great. I love peel ' n eat shrimp, these were fabulous. \nAll in all food good, customer service shitty. I'll give it another try as I hope for a better experience. ...if not better on round 2, you'll hear about it."
2,"Another \""great\"" restaurant inside Aliante Station.\n\nI gave them an extra star for the perky staff. But that's it. \n\nI tried the potato pancakes. You get a ton of them! Too bad they tasted like lemon and vinegar. I took  two bites out of a plate that was LITERALLY overflowing with pancakes. I tried telling the server that something was wrong because they tasted terrible and she insisted that the vinegar-lemon taste was the German recipe.\n\nNow, I've never waited tables before. But it's common sense to me that if a fat lady orders a giant platter of potatoes and takes literally two small bites, she didn't like it and it should have been removed from the bill. But that's just me. Those who can't do, teach. Right?\n\nWon't be back. Nope."
2,As a bride I was VERY disappointed with the services!  They ran more than a half hour past my appointment making me late to my own wedding and because the hair dresser was rushing the curls all fell out and my hair looked horrible; I would have been better off doing it myself!
2,"DID YOU KNOW ALL THE CHEESECAKE FACTORIES ARE THE SAME?  \n\nI have been to a few of them, and this one was like the others.  If you like one where ever you are, then you'll like this one.  \n\nSERVICE:  \nThe wait is long if you go around dinner time.  We waited, gambled, and drank to get a buzz and went later than 9:00 p.m.   So, we got seated fairly quickly.  The service...nothing special...it's what you'd expect at any Cheesecake Factory restaurant.  \n\nFOOD QUALITY:  \nThe food was okay.  It was, as I said earlier, like any other Cheesecake Factory on the planet.  \n\nWOULD I GO THERE AGAIN?: \nProbably not."
2,"Storytime!\n\nWeekend. 12:30 AM. Out being rowdy with a nice group of friends. \""Let's go to Mario's.\"" Reluctantly, I oblige--we walk in and head to the top floor. A DJ poorly transitions 90s favorites with modern hits. The place is packed--short skirts, popped collars, the reek of cologne and stale beer. We find a place to group together and dance/talk/drink a bit. A group of well-dressed 20-something bros starts laughing and wafting in my direction. \""Bro, I just let out a wicked fart, and it's COMIN' YOUR WAY. IT'S SO GROSS.\"" I can confirm that it was gross.\n\nA waitress walks by and spills beer all over my leg. Whoops. She grabs my shoulder and says \""whoops.\"" A girl falls over trying to take off her heels. A few more girls stumble around as some dudes smell the vulnerability and swoop in to talk about how expensive their watches are.\n\nI don't mean to be negative, and I'm always down for a party...I'm just not trying to have a bunch of bros fart on me. I thought we had enough of that in college.\n\nMario's is an alright sports bar as long as you don't go after 10 PM on Thursday-Saturday. Whenever I've been for food and sports and a Yuengling, I haven't been disappointed; the service could be a bit slow, but oh well."
2,"Great food.  Reasonably priced(relative).  But service is horrendous.  I believe we received terrible service because we weren't interested in ordering a bunch of appetizers or bottles of wine.  We were a group of 10 guys all in late 20s early 30s in town for a bachelor party, beer and liquor and meat is all we needed .  Our waitress ignored is the entire night but surprisingly all the tables around us were receiving 5 star service.  I can't rate higher than a 2 with the service being as bad as it was.  What a shame."
2,"While the room itself is decent for what we paid, the casino itself with the people who work there are total failure!!    Dont expect to have a fun gamble and get you drink when you play with brick face dealer who is sitting there emotionless like a robot machine.  For the time I spend there gambling, I never had the drinks serve and bartenders in a bar dont care to talk to you unless you flush your cash for their tip.  \nIf you on a budget,I recommend for  you to stay at Luxor but party and gamble somewhere else."
2,"Meh!  Very average food, poor HH, especially the wine.  I really wanted it to be good but was not impressed.  I left with a $30 bill after 2 average tacos, a very small pour on a cheap wine( which was $9) and a side of beans.  \nThe bad was beautiful.  Too bad the food did not match the atmosphere."
2,"Typical Indian restaurant. Greasy and oily food. Taste was okay. Experience was okay at best. \n- We used the yelp 15% off coupon here - the owner firstly frowned after looking at the deal (promotion that they had been running). He honored the deal but made us feel as if he was doing us a favor. \n- They were catering a private party in the restaurant and still kept it open for general public. The party family kids created havoc, noise and jumped on our tables. Horrible service, they never even cared to apologize for the inconvenience. At least they didnt serve us from the buffet as the party (which I have seen many cheap Indian restaurants do)\n- There are many other good restaurants in Vegas that have great reviews on Yelp. Skip this one if you can."
2,"Good selection, but the food was rather boring. Ate here once. Won't go back. Go to the food court or tgi Friday's instead"
2,"Order consisted of queso, guacamole and assorted tacos. In brief lacking in flavor. The guacamole was not flavorful at all. Slow, inattentive service. Many better choices out there for mexican. Will not be back."
2,"Hmmm. I was a little disappointed when I went to this dealership to pick up a t-shirt. There were plenty of people working there in the retail section of the store, and not one person asked if we needed assistance. Maybe I don't look like a motorcycle mama.\n\nI did find a cool t-shirt for the man, and I'm sure that if I was needing parts for a hog they'd be great, but a mightier than though attitude from a sales clerk is a huge let down. I would go back to the dealer in Phoenix to look for anything else I needed.\n\nOh, they had cool faucets in the restroom."
2,"Not great but. I will probably try again.\n\nLet me explain: you go in and try to read a menu that is about 10\"" from your face, along the wall. Ok fine, I found something I wanted. So I ordered my brat, toppings, etc. and a few kids meals. The kids meal indicates that a hot dog, chips, and soda are included. When I asked about the side for the kids meal, the manager acted kind of annoyed that I didn't understand how things work. He said, with a sigh, like this is the dumbest thing he'd ever heard, \"" everything here is ala carte\"". Even the kids meal? Well that's interesting because the menu does a horrible job of showing that. Then does that mean toppings like onions cost extra too? I didn't bother asking because the guy was kind of a d*ck about the menu. \n\nThe fries and tots are baked, and not very good. The brat alone cost about $7 which is a lot for something that was pre-cooked and sitting in some kind of oil or water solution before he put it in the bun.\n\nBut the flavor was good and they have lots of sausages, so I will probably try again. Just how about not acting like a jerk when a family spends $50 on your second day of operation, and your menu is incredibly confusing. $12 for a brat, fries, and Pepsi (yeah, no coke) is a lot. Bring your Bentley and try it for yourself."
2,"Uhhh, can I just say it now and get it over with?  That was the DRYEST, CHEWIEST, MOST FLAVORLESS Chicken Salad Sandwich I have ever had served on cardboard (Wheat) bread that I have ever had.  \n\nIt's a basic sports bar here with all the big TV's, but seemed pretty empty today for lunch so it is obviously not a Monday business lunch place.   Prices were less than I expected, most menu items for lunch were from 6.25 to 11.  Very reasonable, but only if they would have had some flavor!!  \n\nBe sure to order a drink, you will need it to wash down that dry sandwich.\n\nYou were warned!"
2,"I don't know where to begin. My experience was pretty terrible from stepping in the door. \n\nI was greeted and rushed through ordering, waited over 20 minutes for the the food. Got back to my office to eat, it was awful. It smelled awful, tasted awful. This is nothing like what I anticipated. \n\nI had Mongolian Beef and Clear Soup. I eat Asian food as often as I can get my hands on it, I've never had such poorly prepared and cooked Asian food. \n\nThe Mongolian Beef was greasy, over spiced, tough, etc. \nThe steamed rice wasn't fully cooked.\nThe soup was mediocre, at best. \n\nOverpriced, for a lunch entree and soup (no drink) I paid over $13.00. \n\nI'm pretty disappointed. And still hungry for lack of eating lunch."
2,"I'm underwhelmed by this place. The food is okay.  The service is SLOW!  Overall an okay experience, but I'd recommend going elsewhere in the area."
2,"Came for lunch and the service wasn't great.  The food was OK.  I had the sashimi Benito box. The miso dressing on my salad was watery and bland. I guess they forgot the seaweed salad I ordered.  I told the waitress and she didn't even apologize or ask if I wanted it.  When she brought the bill, she said \""I took it off the bill for you\"" with a big smile, like she did me a favor.  Of course she took it off the bill, I never got it."
2,"I very, very rarely write in to Yelp, but I feel like I need to be the tie-breaker on this one, as the reviews are wildly divergent.\n\nThere are two possibilities for this place.  Either\n\na) it entirely depends on when you are here\n\nor\n\nb) people don't know what good BBQ is here in Madison.\n\nNow, I live in NYC now, so I'm a bit food-spoiled.  But I love BBQ, so my standards are pretty low.\n\nThis was not good BBQ.  I had the full ribs, with mac & cheese, succotash.  Sides were alright, nothing to write home about.  The ribs were overcooked and dried out, and were intolerable on their own.  Sure, if you slather them in enough BBQ sauce, they taste alright, but so does cardboard.\n\nDon't go.  Overly expensive (at least by Madison standards) and just flat out not good BBQ."
2,When it comes to service this Dairy Queen is the worst.  It's always dirty and there's never a manager on duty.  If there's a spill it stays on the floor and doesn't get cleaned up.  The gal came out with our food and a little girl ran in front of her.  The gal spilled our drinks but didn't replace it.  We had to go back up and ask for it and she also forgot my daughter's smoothie.
2,"Ugh.  Food that is not nearly as good as Taco Bell is priced like it's four diamond fare.  And to go with it, enjoy the weakest drinks on the strip.  The only reason this place gets 2 stars instead of one is that the service was good."
2,"The service here is non-existent.  We were seated 6 inches away from another table, after being told we couldn't sit at a different table, because there were only two of us and this particular table had 3 chairs. Then we waited for a long time for a server to come, which never happened.   Finally just got up and left.  Very disappointed."
2,"Very small selection. I think it was $15 a person. Seriously... I think you are better off grabbing a burger. The desert was cool, but food wise.. you literally get up to grab your food, and that's it.... there is no extra food that will be coming out, just chicken, grill or fried, mashed potatoes, veggies, and a few others.. but nothing is special about this buffet. The wait to get in was crazy... and I still can't understand why."
2,"I must say that the look of this shop is lovely but the experience I had there was terrible: \n\nFirstly, I had to pay the fee to try on the dresses and then they were so rude about me bringing more than two people with me to try on, though of course I wanted to bring my mum, step mum and mother in law to see my wedding dress. The staff were condescending and pushy and lots of the dresses fairly tacky looking. However they turned out to be the best of a bad bunch so in the end I did buy my dress from them. On the day however the corset was very hard for my bridesmaid to do up, agony to sit down in, warped in shape by the end on the evening and left me with bruising around my ribs that lasted 3 months. Being in pain like this really put a dampen on my wedding day so needless to say, I cannot recommend them. Also, the dress they made me looked nothing like the one I had tried on initially in shape so I was disappointed with the look despite any modifications they tried to make."
2,"I'm not the biggest gambler, but since some of my friends are we usually make a stop out to the Casino for an afternoon whenever we're up in Montr\u00e9al.  When in a casino, I'll usually play a few hands of Blackjack to get a complimentary drink or two while my buddy is doing \""serious gambling.\""  So needless to say I was a bit surprised by some of the practices here.\n\nI'm not a smoker, so the fact that they don't allow smoking on the gaming floor isn't a issue with me, but I do drink and besides that it's always seemed better for business to allow it.  But they don't.  You can only have drinks in designated bar areas.  There are also windows and clocks... so for those of you that are use to Vegas style casinos, this might seem a bit strange.\n\nAside from that, it's a decent casino. The layout is nice and not too confusing, which always helps."
2,Not a lot of variety for the price. There was nothing that tasted really good that I would recommend wasting your money on. There are much better places to eat in Vegas.
2,"This place is pretty much a home garage style business tucked away in a side commercial building selling Micargi Walmart bikes. \n\nI found them on Craigs List and decided to take a look last week after visiting many other bicycle shops looking for the perfect bike. Hey, if you want to purchase a cheap Walmart bike sold out of a makeshift shop, then this might be your place.  \nThey had a small work table scattered with tools, no computer and it looked very unorganized. Defiantly does not look like not a typical service bike shop with no building sinage except for a sticker on the window. Their Craigs list ad advertised check us out on Yelp and I did."
2,"The facility is nice and clean and appears new. The sales staff is nice and friendly and the prices seem very reasonable. \n\nThe main problem here is the range check-in staff. We were told there was one lane open and then a wait. We took the open lane for a group of 5 and thought we were lucky. The lanes on both sides were open and unused the entire time. I stepped out to let the staff know and see if we could split and use two lanes. I was told no, that they were currently used. The staff has cameras and can see that they are not. When challenged politely that they lanes in fact were not being used the staff behind the counter seemed annoyed and rebuked the suggestion that they were open. \n\nThis left the impression that they artificially creating wait times. During our entire time there 4 of the available 8 lanes in our area were open and not being used. They were not damaged or broken either.\n\nSo if you have to go here press the staff on lanes. Make sure you aren't being made to wait for no reason. There are other places to shoot and perhaps you should go elsewhere."
2,"Well, I ate here and I didn't die... I can't say the same for my taste buds...\n\nLook, I'm going to keep it short and just say this: I've eaten here two times and both times, I have been disappointed... So has everyone else in my party...\n\nThe service was really spotty... Sometimes, the server would be all over us, but it took like 20 minutes to get the check and we didn't see her at all that whole time... \n\nAnyway, the food... I got the chicken tenders and ribs app with fries and it was all meh... The ribs themselves were of a questionable quality to me, but the boyfriend tolerated them...  The tenders tasted mostly like breading...\n\nThe next time, I tried a salad with a cup of soup... The salad managed to be bland, even with dressing... I don't know what happened... The soup tasted like Spaghettio's without the pasta... Just thick and really sweet...\n\nThey have trivia on Tuesday nights, which is pretty fun, so give them a shot... It's a good time... Just eat dinner before you go... Please."
2,I keep going and getting fooled by this place.  It looks like so much fun.  Their decor is witty and exciting but for me it ends there.  I have gone twice during lunch time and my burger was over cooked.  The meat was nothing better than the five guys that is right down the street.  Keep in mind I am talking about the meat as is.  It could be rat meat and you could put all the crap that is there on it and it would taste good.  The burger itself isn't worth the money.\n\nGo to five guys.\n\nColin
2,"Boo!  I was here once, and it was horrible.  Just like any other club, it offered a too loud atmosphere with nowhere to sit and overpriced drinks with horrible music blaring.  How do people put up with it?\n\nThere was a decent little acrobatics show that didn't offend me too much, and the go-go dancers were kinda fun to laugh at.\n\nThe clientele was very odd.  Not the mixture of bros and..uhm..companions at other clubs, a weirdly older and perhaps societally inept mix filled this place.\n\nAgain, it was just weird.\n\nThere's no reason why anyone should want to capture the spirit of this place's namesake, but this place surely falls short if that's the goal.\n\nOne star for a picture of Elton John on the wall that successfully helped us complete a running Elton John joke of the night."
2,Hmm.. came here drunk as a skunk so which means i dont remember anything good about this place.\n\n2 stars because these communist bastards jack up their prices and their quality isn't getting better.
2,"I'm not a huge fan of purchasing overpriced and underrated electronics here but my husband insisted on buying another best buy computer, even after our last terrible experience. So here i am with his computer again... in line at geek squad.  You have two employees working with seven customers and three employees in customer service standing around watching us get pissed off.  Great job!   Next time I'm buying dell direct."
2,"Came here because of all the positive reviews, but wouldn't go out of my way to go there...The prices aren't as great as everyone seemed like it is...for prepared foods, I can go to Sunflower Market or Fresh and Easy, also Geri's Old Philadelphia at Pecos/Tropicana also sells a bunch of East Coast Favorites like Tastykake and Wise Chips and Drakes and stuff like that...Only thing that my mom would probably go to Glazier's for is pork roll...But living at Sandhill/Hacienda we have plenty of choices on where to go and can price compare and have plenty of stores with the same East Coast selection...Its good that the SW now has a choice other than the expensive VONS or the always-busy Wal-Mart..."
2,"I didn't like anything... Expensive rest home food...  Actually the salad bar was ok, that's why they got an extra star.."
2,"We went this morning and decided just to have the buffet since the waiter did not produce a menu and seemed to be pushing the buffet. It was fairly disappointing; the biscuit and gravy was by far the highlight,  in my opinion, but don't be too excited by my choice of words. In addition, it was a good 5 or 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged we were waiting to be seated. When we were finally seated, the table and my chair were both still dirty. I could add more, but the bottom line is that this was definitely not even close to my best restaurant experience."
2,"Service was slow. Ordered a nonfat chai latte with shot of espresso, not too complicated. The chai was bitter due to the herbs not being strained out which also made it gritty- a very unpleasant texture in a drink. The only pluses about this place is the decor & patio. Didn't try any food but it looked good."
2,"our group of 6 had dinner at n9ne on a Sunday evening at 9 Food was decent not amazing.  The prices were outrageous and the atmosphere was lacking. Definitely not worth the crazy prices, there are so many other great places with better atmosphere and food to try."
2,"Was it because it was Monday evening or is this common.... sparsely stocked buffet with sad, old looking food.  I was expecting more selection, more enticing food.  Alas, this was a much smaller buffet than the Rio and much less satisfying.   Thank goodness I did the buffet of buffets so that I could try another buffet to satisfy my urge."
2,"This place is classic, the food is great. The service is horrible, hence why it's getting 2 stars from me. I believe service to be a critical component of the dining experience. \n\nThe manager is extremely rude and not at all accommodating. I tried to organize a dinner party for about 30 people here, the manager told me that he was unwilling to accommodate a party of our size during dinner. He said we could come at 5:30 or at 9 because our party would take up too much space and he had other patrons to think about. Guess what manager, you just turned 30 people guaranteed to order 30 dinners... Idiot. \n\nI've never been spoken to so rudely. I'll never come here again. There are several steakhouse in the Las Vegas area, no need to come to this one and be treated like crap."
2,The good news is that they have a nice vegan menu. The bad news is that they are not that great at serving vegan food. I ordered vegan enchiladas & they ended up serving me vegan chicken strips rolled up in torillas with sauce. The side salad was also missing.\nThey also don't do well with special orders. My husband is vegetarian & asked for a normal cheese enchilada with the vegan chicken strips. The first plate they brought out was just chicken enchiladas. The second plate was just vegan enchiladas. Not that great in my opinion.
2,"I don't mind eating with other people, but I felt like I was in the closet. My table was literally in the runway for the kitchen and a freeway of customers and severs were constantly hovering over me and wanting in line to get by on the single lane isle. Service was a little slow as was waiting for the food. We brought the kids, 3 and 4. They were very understanding and kind to my little monsters, which I really appreciated. They were \""real\"" people. \n\nBut that being said. My primary reason for being there was the food. I like cheese. I love cheese. But if I can't see my main course because an impassable mountain of cheese is blocking me, then that would be too much cheese. After I mined for my noodles, my meal was actually pretty good.\n\nSo interesting place put needs some refining for me to return."
2,Very slow service.  Very lack luster food.  We had periods of 15-20 minutes in between dishes being delivered.  Vegetable paella was cool when it came out and not flavorful.    The poatos bravas are potato chips here.  Disappointed since everyone loves the real potatoes Bravas. The highlight of the meal were the gin and tonics and the endive with goat cheese tapas.
2,Food isn't as good as the Southend location and the service is terrible 2 out the 6 times I've been. Good beer selection though
2,"I wanted 10 once wheat grass , they charge d me 5 times 2 onces price instead of 8 extra one once. Bad"
2,"Ordered the Go healthy sandwich with no bread due to my allergies. They wouldn't substitute the bread for anything, not even fruit. \n\nThe turkey was gross - the processed type that comes from the grocery. Spinach was raw and egg whites were microwaved. I couldn't eat it. \n\nFood was overpriced for what you get, but it's convenient if you're staying at the Vdara."
2,"My gel manicure started peeling off in big chunks after a week.  I read all these good reviews so I was really expecting a great manicure, but I wasn't impressed."
2,This restaurant  has amazing food and as long as the manager named Ping is not your server you will have an amazing dinning experience. If ping is your server you will be lucky to get a fork to eat with. The worst service ever!!!
2,"Nothing Grand about this buffet.  While serviceable, there are definitely better meals to be had in LV, buffets included.\n\nLike other LV buffets, MGM Grand Buffet has a wide variety of food to offer: crab legs, prime rib, turkey, ribs, shrimp, pasta, pizza, sushi, so on and so forth.  The prime rib was pretty good but, unfortunately, none of the remaining offerings were particularly special at Grand Buffet.  The crab legs are not as good as Bellagio's or Wynn's.  in fact, I'm not sure if this is a  sign of quality or what, but the crab legs at MGM didn't  pull cleanly out of the shells as they do at the aforementioned Bellagio or Wynn buffets.   I found myself spending too much time trying to pull the meat out of the shells, despite the fact that they are already split cleanly in half. The remainder of what I tried was ok, but nothing special at all.\n\nI go to a LV buffet intent on eating back any money I've gambled away, so I have higher expectations than this.  Like some other casinos, MGM Grand Buffet currently offers a buffet all day long.  For $30 ($40 on weekends) you can have mediocre buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner instead of just one meal.  Need to step it up MGM!"
2,"Service is a little slow (which may not be a bad thing depending on your mood), but the food is just okay.  Very friendly staff and a nice atmosphere, but the best thing we ate was the Greek salad, and for those prices, it should have been better."
2,"I am a regular here, but must say that I was very disappointed last time I was there, I went to get a nail broken fixed I waited for over an hour! Ridiculous...  \nI like this place a lot but I only have my nails done with Libby, every time I have had it with someone else it is NO good, no to mention that I HATE that they keep talking among themselves in vietnamese, so rude. Once I knew that they were saying something about me and I asked what they were saying about me, they just said oh yes we were talking about your beautiful eyelashes... yeah right!"
2,"I took in a large garbage bag full of clothes and brand new skiing outfit. They didn't purchase anything. The majority of the stuff I took in was in good conditon, classic style, and name brand stuff. I even had a dress with the tags still attached. I asked why they didn't buy anything and the buyer in training said that the condition they were in and the style wasn't what they were looking for. I saw some of the clothes they did have and it was in worse condition than my stuff."
2,"Perhaps the drabbest of the Marriotts I have ever stayed in.  Unfortunately this was a forced choice by our conference location.  By far the inferior sister of the Marriott in uptown, I was glad when my stay was over.  My room on the 18th floor was damp and smelled a little funky.  A somewhat of nice touch was the sort of turndown service, where the hotel staff came around each room offering candy bars.\n\nConference facilities are actually pretty good and the food decent enough to warrant a recommendation for future conferences.\n\n2 stars for the passable stay, but stay in uptown or Southpark Marriotts if you can."
2,Ok so here's the thing...the bar is called Rockhouse. We went there after reading reviews all hyped up for beer pong and girls in cages. Nope. Nada. Zip. Empty cages. No pong. Hip hop that was happening maybe 4 years ago. Idk...perhaps its just me? But I felt duped. Nothing that was advertised at all plus no rock music. Humph.
2,"We tried it because of rave reviews we have heard, but left disappointed.  The ambiance was fine execpt towards the end of our meal they decided to adjust a table nearby and it became like a construction zone with drills and loud power tools.  Granted it was during lunch, but we still felt it could have been done at another time when most of the restaurant was not full.\n\nThe burgers were okay, but not at all what I would consider great.  They were not very juicy, or flavorful in and of themselves, but there were interesting toppings to choose from. And, despite the burgers not being juicy the bottom of the buns were falling apart.\n\nThe service was pleasant but the food didn't really hit the mark on our visit."
2,"This was my first time at SP. We waited about 15 min after being seated before someone came to take our order. We were never offered or asked if we wanted anything to drink. We started with pot stickers and egg roles then continued with orange chicken. After ordering, the pots tickers came right out and tasted old and deep fried when the menu said pan fried. Within 2 minutes after getting the appetizer our entree came out. It really worries me when food comes out that fast. All the food tasted old and refried and the fried rice was mushy.\n\nThe service was not good and no one came back to check on us or to refill our drinks. The waited disappeared and the only reason we got boxes or a check was because the busser  saw me looking around for service. \n\nWe will probably not return."
2,"Eh. Had a business lunch there recently and was underwhelmed. A couple of things were good, one was great and couple were absolutely undistinguished. \n\nLunch for 4 was $200, and a couple of people left hungry. \n\nGreat dish with grilled fish on brussel sprouts in horseradish cream sauce, and one of the sushi rolls was great, look for teh one with Saracha. They don't have ice-tea. Atmosphere is a bit like dining at a restaurant in a mall, because that's where it is. Oysters were the smallest I've ever seen, literally. Service was passable."
2,"PROs\n- Staff is friendly\n- Drinks are creative and tasty\n\nCONs\n- Bread was stale and shouldn't have been served\n- Many items were WAY too salty \n- My salmon was noticeably under-cooked\n- Desserts took forever to arrive (waiter took a smoke break)\n- The key lime pie was sold out. I was instead given a flakey abomination garnished with whip cream.\n- Decor would be considered classy only at a sweet 16 (I might just be bitter)\n- Food prices were way too high considering its quality\n\nOverall:\nEstablishing good drink recipes is fine if you're just a bar but it doesn't cut it for dinner service. Though ambitions were high on all 3 courses, the execution was very poor and couldn't be saved even with fancy ingredients. I wouldn't have cared if my salmon was Irish, Spanish or Philipino, I just didn't expect to be eating it still squishy. My date, not wanting to ruin our anniversary, politely ate her food but felt ill afterwards from the overwhelming amounts of salt and parm in her risotto. \nSuite 701 is best described as fancy-style food. You're paying a premium for being in a large location in Old Montreal, attached to a hotel and served food on large, ornate plates. I'd like to say that I'll give them another try in case it was a temporary screw up but, with their pricing, it's not a gamble I'd be willing take."
2,"This is a review for the Lake of Dreams show.\n\nThe show plays every 30 minutes starting when the sun is down.  The website said that it started at 8 pm, so we and a bunch of other people were waiting at 7:45.  It gets past 8 and then we're told that it's not gonna happen until 8:30 because there was still some light in the sky. LAME.\n\nSo we came back at 8:30 and the show lasted literally 3 minutes.  It was a giant frog that sang \""What a Wonderful World\"" on top of the fake waterfall.  It was pretty cool, but I was expecting the show to last longer.\n\nThen we came again at 9 to check out the second show (there's 2 different shows each night, we were told), and it BROKE DOWN! There were these two balls that were circling around the pond (kind of boring), and in the middle of the show the lights went out and the song stopped. \n\nThis show definitely cannot compete with the other free shows on the strip.  Go see the Bellagio fountains instead."
2,"I will say that I am happy with my facial wax and pedicure. However, the manicure was done first with shellac, which looked like dried clumps of candle wax on my nails. I had the woman redo it with regular polish because I had already spent hours of my life there. My novice niece did a better job on my nails in 20 min with a Sally Hansen shellac kit from Walmart. For $80 plus tip, I expect better results!"
2,"Ugh - so I went here this morning and while there was nothing wrong with the food (just got apple cinnamon oatmeal - review on that later) the cashier was bothering me.  I mean it's freaking 7:45 AM in the morning - just let me pay for my damn oatmeal and get to work!  \n\nThere was NO ONE else in line, therefore no one in front of me and I'm standing in front of the cashier waiting to pay...now get this...I'm standing there, debit card in hand, while she's completing a text message.  And it's not like she just needs to press \""send\"" oh no - there's is content getting written before my eyes as I wait there, and I'm thinking to myself is this really happening, who the hell could she be texting this early, and why the hell is she making me wait while she completes the content of a text message.  \n\nNow, I realize that ABP (Au Bon Pain) isn't some uber-professional establishment, but I'm thinking this should be in customer service 101 - stop texting while a customer is waiting to pay for item, you may resume texting after customer(s) are gone.  \n\nThe oatmeal was tasty - and I like that they have a self-serve topping area (containers filled with nuts, cranberries, raisins, brown sugar, granola).  They had a choice between plain and apple cinnamon oatmeal - I went for the apps cinn mush - good stuff.  If only they could train their employees better."
2,"Curious as to why this place hadn't closed down like the other restaurants in the horribly placed strip mall parking lot Tommy's sits in, my wife and I decided to stop in and try a burger... Oddly, they all come with chili, mustard, onion and pickle... The chili was more like alpo and the burger patty was thinner than a mcdonalds  patty! Fries were good, but that's about it! And judging by the girl working the drive thru, you don't need a high school diploma to work here. Still not quite sure how this place remains open..."
2,"Well not impressed.  The only good thing was the chips and salsa and my Dr. Pepper which was self serve.  Had the carne-asada burrito.  It was dried up beef with guacamole that lacked flavor.  I ask for the pico on the side and they brought me another bowl of salsa (great).  Well the cheese crisp was good, but fell apart as we were eating it.  The wife like her Chicken Burrito with green sauce, but in my opinion it was the stewed chicken place in a tortilla and the smothered with sauce and cheese then put under the broiler... All this for $22, well, last and only time...  OH...  The service and employees were great..."
2,"I was super disappointed with this place... My boyfriend really wanted to go here so we decided to swap Jason's deli (which is right across the street )for this place. that was a bad idea, the service was horrible they made us wait so long and charged us for things without letting us know first this is the second time I've gone to a PT's run Company... Even our first experience at PT's was absolutely horrible...  The servers acted like we were a nuisance and they didn't even want us there it took a long time to get our food and the even messed up on the order And still charged full price for it. But on a lighter note the food was actually very good my boyfriend got a steak salad and I got a hamburger and it was very very good so my suggestion to you is to call it in and pick it up and enjoy you are meal somewhere else. I really wanted to enjoy this place but I guess the hunt for a good pub and eatery is still on in full force!"
2,Office and restrooms are very dusty and dirty. Staff is rude and to busy with inside gossip then to help or be even cordial. I was referred by my primary so I drove all the way from the far west valley. To be treated like crap. Love it.
2,"Bummer.    Went for happy hour.  Ordered winds and a beer.\n\nService was satisfactory on a busy world series final game.\n\nIf you cook, then cook!   Wings were so blah; what's the point.   Ordered Honey Hot.   Well, salt is hotter than those wings.   And they were dry perhaps because i asked for the grilled, then tossed in sauce method (for a $1 more).  Another friend said the same thing and he got a different sauce.  So not a wing place.\n\nBeer selection ho-hum.\n\nAtmosphere.  Good.  \n\nWill I go back, not unless there is a compelling reason; it's off the beaten  track for me, but friends wanted to try it.  Will explore other options."
2,Service advisor that greeted me was showing little interest of my LS issue.  They were running around in crisis trying to locate loaner car for someone else.  Not what I am use to by a Lexus dealership.  I drove away.
2,I only went here because i had a coupon that came in the mail. The store is not setup in a way that it easy to get around and serve yourself. They don't have a wide selections of flavors. The toppings have even a less of variety and were all just about empty. \n\nThe girls working the front counter were just sitting around on the counter and were not too friendly at all.
2,"First time eating here, didn't think the food or service was all that great. The restraint has a pot of bowling broth in the center of the table and you go to fridges and select what you want to cook. The food just didn't have enough flavor in my opinion. However there is a small selection of food that you can have cooked by the chefs in the kitchen. The beef tenderloins were amazing and did have a ton of flavor if you do go herein strongly recommend eating here. The service was the main reason for the two stars I would often have to wave several times to get the attention of one of the three servers and it was not busy at all there were only 2 other tables in the restaurant. Even when the servers would stop by the table to grab some of the empty plates it was hard to get their attention to ask them for something. One even walked away when I was in the middle of ordering another dish. Also the ice in the drinks had a very odd chemical odor however I didn't notice a taste difference. The restaurant is very clean and modern hopefully it was just a bad experience."
2,"I walked in with a group of 7. It was this gays turn to show the co-workers a night outside the Scottsdale scene. \n\nThey rejected us because one of our girls had a purse \""bigger than a clutch.\"" It cost us $60 in cab fare to get there, and they wouldn't budge, even after we emptied the purses.\n\nSo we hoped into a cab and had a great night at Amsterdam."
2,"B\u00e2ton Rouge is normally a restaurant I like to go (the one downtown Montreal, in the Complexe Desjardins, is one of my favorite of the branch). But this one left me...dissatisfied.   \n\nThe service was slow! Like...suuuppeeerrr slow. And yes, they may have a menu for the kids, but because of slowness of the service, your patience will grow thin while you try to calm down toddlers and preschoolers in their chairs. The food was an average \""OK\"", nothing to drool on...except the special lobster poutine they had: that one was pretty good! The cucumber mojito tasted more like water than a mojito, unfortunately.  \n\nOverall, the rest was pretty average for our experience at this branch."
2,"I honestly can't think of a sushi experience that wasn't better than Yellowtail.  We walked in without reservations and had almost no wait.  The atmosphere is like a nightclub, the music was loud and terrible, and it was extremely dark.\n\nPutting all of that aside, the food was mediocre at best.  The sauce that the tofu came with tasted exactly like Oriental Ramen broth.  The rolls were extremely small and had minimal flavor, the edemame was adequate although half of it was overcooked.\n\nI think their slogan on the business card said it all:\n\n\""Yellowtail - Barely Adequate\"""
2,"Chipotle...translation...Chipotle...which means commercialized Mexican food in layman's terms. So as far as this goes I am a much bigger fan of Baja Fresh across the street and after this last experience at Chipotle I will probably continue to dine at the Baja Fresh location across the street.\nSo I am have never been a huge fan of Chipotle, except for the fact that the portions are huge.\nWhat I am not a fan of is spending $10.18 on a single burrito and a tiny little bag of stale ass chips and day old salsa. I mean the burrito was filled mostly with beans and rice, the cost on that for them must be a whole 7 maybe 8 cents per portion. Ridiculous.\nI was not extremely impressed with Chipotle to begin with the novelty has worn off and so has the food taste. It's not good anymore. At least not at this location. Bland...not good for Mexican food."
2,Very pricey and a very slim selection of only cocktails. You can't take your own pictures and have to pay for theirs. It's a tourist trap for sure but if you can afford it- its worth checking out if you've never been. Just be prepared to spend a lot of money.
2,"Ok, this place has tons of potential, but do we really need the blaring crappy house music? There's plenty of that on the strip, Fremont is for the other half of the population who hate the strip. Please rectify your DJ situation Vanguard Lounge and I promise to return."
2,"I will not be back. I've been here 3 times because they are so close to my house, each time trying to see if maybe I'm wrong. Well 3 strikes you're out. The pancakes had way to much baking soda or powder and the omelets are overcooked. The only thing that was good was the sip of mimosa I had. Not impressed."
2,"My family and I were looking for places to eat, while in Vegas, and we came upon this buffet. We thought we'd try it out since it was an all-you-can-eat buffet for $9.99.\n\nI thought, coming into this buffet, the food would be good. It was alright. The food was salty, and some were even cold. The service there was friendly, even though you could barely hear what they are asking you."
2,"Candy Coated Recipe \n\nSugar Factory, please add...\n\n*3 large sized \""Cross-Trained\"" Employees\n*2 happy Attitude Adjustments \n*1 medium sized Refrigerated Display Case\n\nTo your already...\n\n*Delicious selection of candies, baked goods, & cold treats  \n*Bright & colorful establishment\n\nYes, there was only one person helping with order taking and making of the labor intensive products they have on the menu even though there were 4 people. I guess no one can help that person out. In addition to the velvet brownie & chocolate milkshake, we ordered 4 macarons that were $1.50 a pop for the half-dollar sized yum-yums. Unfortunately, they aren't kept cool in a refrigerated section so they just get hard and downright nasty sitting there. The girl behind the counter said they make them fresh everyday and that they were popular. It's a shame I paid 6 bucks for nasty wafer like cookies. I could have bought myself 2 boxes of OREOS with that money. The only thing going for this over-priced place is the Couture Pops! Sure their pricey but it's all about being seen with those bling-blingin' trendy lollipops. I bought one with a box of refills ($40)."
2,"Slow service, mediocre food and the temp in the dining room was very cold.\n\nWe tried this place years ago when they first opened.  The food then was not good and we wrote the place off.  Last week we found ourselves looking for a quick bite and decide to give it another try.\n\nThe food is no better now than it was when they first opened.  The Gyro meat was dry and salty, the fries were still frozen in the center, my son's chicken strips were mostly breading and the salad was soggy and tasteless.\n\nThe service was very slow.  We were one of three tables in the whole place and our food took about 20 minutes to come out.\n\nI am a home owner in this neighborhood and proud of where I live. I truly want the local businesses to be the best of the best but unfortunately this place could use a visit from Restaurant Impossible."
2,"Eh, basically shoes for old women.  The only reason they're even \""famous\"" is 'cause of Sex and the City... though I did love the knee-length cage boots.\n\nChristian Louboutin FTW."
2,"I understand that there is nostalgia and myth surrounding this pizza shop, but the current reality is that the pizza mediocre. It's better than some pizza options, but it doesn't deserve the hype that it gets. The crust is super thin (which I like), but lacks flavor and texture, the sauce lacks zest, and the cheese is just there. \n\nI wanted to love Aiello's; the staff was fantastic, the restaurant has that great old pizzeria vibe, but unfortunately the product is just not good enough to bring me back."
2,I guess I didn't think it lived up to its hype..maybe it's because some of the food just didn't taste like how everyone was describing it to taste. Some of the sushi was rather gross and I saw the line for the crab legs and almost cried. I'm actually going to give this buffet another try the next time I'm in Vegas since I don't remember anything special about it.
2,"Nice break from the heat. Went twice over the weekend. Waitresses were very nice but the manager with the soul patch was a tool. Had it not been for his lack of hospitality,  I would have given it a 5 star rating and would have spent a lot more money! Since they don't care about repeat business, they won't have mine!"
2,"I went in with some girlfriends on Friday night, we sat down at about 9:45pm and ordered a couple margarita's which were good and tasty. Unfortunately, that was the only good thing.  The female  wait staff all seemed like they were on drugs, just odd behavior and super fast and twitchy.  We ordered some tacos which were at best bland and really nothing to write home about.  The beans were good and the chips weren't bad.  It was also odd that the wait staff was using a table in the restaurant as their personal dining table.  Although it was winding down, it just seemed unprofessional.  I live downtown and won't be going back, So-Cal Fish Taco has way better food and service."
2,"I've had better experiences here, but today wasn't one of them. The girl at the counter looked depressed from making the wrong career choice and ordering from her was honestly kind of confusing. Our pizza was slightly burnt on the bottom and one of my pieces pretty much fell apart. It wasn't too bad, but there's just better pizza out there."
2,"I used to love this place a lot. They're a bit on the expensive side, but the pizza was great. Not NY pizza great, but great for what it was. I picked up a pie on Tuesday (6/2/09) and it was devoid of flavor. Not the first time this happened. What makes a pizza place great in my opinion is consistency. I've dined in a few times and the staff seemed annoyed and came off as rude.\nI'm officially done with Northside Nathans."
2,"The place was small. Nowhere for kids to have a good time at a pizza place. It was cheap but because it wasn't from-scratch dough either. It was like going to little Cesar's. It was okay but I was expecting more of an authentic pizza and something a little greater than what we had, considering the reviews. It's def. not a place to go and chill with a beer and some wings and great pizza on a Sunday afternoon. They don't even sell beer and don't even have fountain drinks. Kinda disappointing. Won't be back here again. Just looking for something different I guess."
2,"\""Meh\"" is definitely the appropriate comment for this place.  The food was OK at best.  The best thing I had was the beans and hot sauce.  I ordered a shredded chicken burrito combo.  Although I was happy to see that the burrito wasn't bigger than my head (seriously, why do places serve such HUGE burritos?), I wasn't happy with much else.  The chicken was watery (literally - I cut into the burrito and water oozed out - gross) and didn't have much flavor.  The rice was bland.  The beans were tasty, especially with LOTS of hot sauce/salsa on them.\n\nCan't say I'll be coming back.  I'll be looking for some burros elsewhere, thank you very much."
2,"My visit at the Cheesecake Factory was not for the obvious reasons. For National Cheesecake Day, the Cheesecake Factory was offering half-off a slice of cheesecake which was the only reason I went. There was a line to get to the hostess but she did a great job keeping everything in order. I only had to wait thirty minutes to get seated. Our waiter was very personable and knew about the new cheesecake flavor that came out that day. I was pleasantly surprised that we got complimentary bread. Of the two options, I liked the wheat better than the white. For my cheesecake, I chose the fresh strawberry cheesecake. It was not bad nor awesome. The cream part of the cheesecake was smooth but did not have the flavor of cream cheese. The graham cracker crust did not hold up well. I did not know that the fresh strawberry cheesecake cost slightly more than the other more elaborate cheesecake so I was slightly shocked when my bill came. The mediocre cheesecake did not make me want to come back here anytime soon."
2,"I liked the Town Square location the one or two times I was there. But the food I got at the Tivoli location was mediocre at best. The sweet potato and chicken risotto ($16.25) was gummy and tasted like paste. The fettuccine napoli ($15.95) was better, but nothing stellar. The best thing I tried was the kid's cheese pizza. Yeah, that means the place is kid friendly. The prices are reasonable -- although from what I hear happy hour is the best time to go since apps are $3 each."
2,"Really the only reason to eat here is because you're starving and it'll take 20 minutes plus to walk across the ginormous MGM grand to cheaper and tastier food options.. Other than that my \""gourmet\"" sandwich tasted pretty awful and cost me a near fortune. Strip dining can be tough, but you'd be better off at Mickey D's..."
2,"First off, best burger I've had in a long time. Yes I agree with the other reviews. The burger is great. However, expensive. We also ordered the lobster mac&  cheese which when brought to the table made us laugh because the serving was so tiny. I ordered a \""specialty\"" cocktial, I don't remember the name but it was made with ginger ale. And all 5 sips were tasty. Just wish I had more sips for the price. I would have given this restaurant only 1 star but since the burger was so good I'll give it a solid two.\n\nPsst...if you want a good burger and better choices. I recommend the SkyBox Sports Grill & lounge located in Aria. For the same price they have a much larger portion. The burger is just as good and they have the BEST Philly Cheesesteak I've ever had!"
2,"First, the good:  The atmosphere and decor is amazing, it is a huge, beautiful old church and is just such a fun space to visit.\n\nNext the not-quite-so-good:  The beer is okay/average for local brewery swill, but  considerably overpriced.  We'd visit a lot more often and probably end up spending more overall if the beer prices weren't so outrageous.\n\nAnd finally, the not-good:  The food.  Granted we only tried one item, but it was AWFUL.  We ordered their basket of \""homemade chips\"" and they were disgusting - cold, soggy spiral-sliced potatoes that were stale (not crispy) and congealed with grease.  Inedible.   The bartender said that they \""make them fresh every day\"" - ours had apparently been made in the morning and had sat around in their own cold grease all day.   We politely sent them back but the bartender didn't seem very happy about it and we spend the remainder of the visit wondering if we were going to have to argue with her about paying for them (as it turned out, we were not charged). \n\nFinal thoughts: it's a cool bar, but the novelty has worn off for us. Mediocre beer at inflated prices and terrible food."
2,"The place is nice and the customer service is pretty good. \n\nI expected a lot more from the food. I got an original stash  burger. The buns taste just like store bought buns and they get soggy with everything they put in them. The beef patty was dry and had no flavor. I ended up leaving most of the soggy buns and eating everything else. The fries are pretty good though. I expected a lot more, especially from a $15+ burguer. \n\nEver heard of GBurger down on socal? Now those are good burgers and for $15 you get a huge one that tastes 10+ times better"
2,"I came here for the first time they the drive thru--the popolo girl that took my order was rude. She also forgot my coconut bark, so I went in to get it. She had some attitude when I walked in and showed her my receipt. She just kept asking me if it was in the receipt. I said I just went thru the drive through and she repeated it back to me, to which she asked if it was on the receipt that I was showing her-she saw it and gave me the bark with no apologies--just attitude."
2,"I really liked this place the first time I came here, but this past visit made me terrified to come back. I told my nail technician before we even started that my nails were a bit sensitive, and if she could please go as easy as she could. As she went to take the gel topcoat off, the sander clipped the top of my nail and sanded my finger. She apologized and said that someone had left it on a different setting. Wouldn't you check first before using a machine like that?? As the manicure went on and throughout, she had me pulling my hands away in slight pain. I guess I should have spoken up more, but I really just wanted to get it over with. She finally finishes, and starts doing the hand and arm massage. Then suddenly she grabs my upper arms. WHAT?! Stunned, I paid and got the Hell out of there. Today (one day after my manicure) the gel polish on my thumb has already lifted and peeled off. Some of the other nails are following suit. I've also noticed bruises on my arm from where she grabbed me! I will never return there. Ever."
2,"We were here for a convention which was all day in this Hilton. The hotel is dated, but the pool appears updated and the conference room is small for about 200 people. I didn't think this place was spectacular and was glad to have booked the Hyatt to stay."
2,"The food and drinks were great..... when we finally got them.  They weren't that busy, but our waitress disappeared for about 35 minutes after taking our drink order.  We waited another 35 minutes to order and then it took about 45more minutes to get our food.  We barely saw our waitress.  We had to keep asking random people who walked by to help us with refills.  Unfortunately this was our first and last experience here.  There is so many restaurants around this square in Chandler - we won't be giving it another chance.  I think for the time and money, we will go somewhere else..."
2,"I'll have a $1 Burger and Fries please with a side of attitude from the older waiter.\n\nThe burger was lukewarm.  The fries were fine.\n\nOur bill came to $10 with the additional drinks, cheese and shake.\n\nThe bitter older male waiter got his wish -- a bad tip - 10% exactly.  I guess when you treat the customers who you know are here for the deal badly, well you are just creating a self-fulfilling prophecy on how much you are going to be tipped.  Funny, the cocktail waitresses in the casino are handing out free drinks and still get tipped.\n\nMy advice to our waiter: If you don't like your job, then get another one."
2,"TERRIBLE customer service.  Absolutely terrible.  They do not care about the customer, treat their customers like they're burdens interrupting their workday, and this location in particular has a very poor inventory.  The store manager, Julie, is no better; she is no advocate for her consumer.  I'll never shop here again."
2,"Again, breaking my rule about chains, especially a gas station, but just be careful. While the prices may be good, they're REALLY fast on the trigger finger, and will demand payment before processing any sales or discounts. Then they'll look at you like YOU'RE the one with the problem when you tell them something was on sale or had a lower marked price.\n\nIt picks up a whole star for convenience when it's right next to my work."
2,Not recommended.  For only a couple bucks more I could have gotten into a much better hotel on the Strip. Regret the buy and won't make the mistake again.
2,"Well its been a month since we adopted our little girl.  she is over the roundwroms and giardia.  She is up to 11 pounds now at 12 weeks and growing bigger everyday.  I did finally get all the paperwork from the rescue on january 3rd.  the agreement, the gift of insurance and a different vaccination record.  i have submitted a claim to the insurance company but it will not cover everything. only the parts for the actuall illnesses she had. We have started the vaccinations all over. she has two more rounds of vaccinations to go.  in about 6 weeks she will get her rabies shot and then we can get her fixed. we will also get her microchipped.  Moondooggies told me that they will find a local rescue to do the microchipping for us.  i am waiting to hear back.\n\nPesce is a happy little girl with a great personality. The kids love her, we love her and our other dog loves her. she is a great addition to our family.  \n\nso even though there were some things that i was very unhappy about in the beginning, we are so thrilled to have this baby girl and are able to give her a long and happy life."
2,this was my first experience with the conveyor belt type sushi. The sushi was not good at all. poor quality and tasteless. prices were very cheap which is probably why it was not tasty...
2,"Doesn't hurt to get your car washed here.  Gas is pretty well priced too, usually a few cents more than Costco.  Car wash prices are OK for the service you get, but still what I consider, not cheap.  Had to take off two stars for \""Danny's Glass\"" which is at that same location.  DO NOT have your glass fixed here.  I had a small CLEAR chip on my windshield..  They offered to fill it for $40.  I should have stopped them when they took the drill out.  Now I have a an opaque drill hole, and a clear chip and a larger divot than before.  I complained to the manager and he told me to call corporate offices for a refund.  How annoying."
2,"I read a bunch of these reviews prior to going here and thought I'd give it a try. I ordered the green curry. I wasn't asked how spicy I wanted it, so I had to tell him. No biggie. He dropped our food off and didn't come back for quite some time. I had to do the ole \""wave your hand in the air\"" to get his attention (something I'm normally opposed to doing). The curry was awfully bland, almost like they it dumbed it down for the South Side crowd. I asked for more curry powder, but he told me they only use curry paste and walked away. I suppose that was his way of saying I don't get any...\nI guess what i'm trying to say is that this place would be good for a person that doesn't like Thai food. Nothing too authentic, flavorful."
2,"Seriously unimpressed. Ordered delivery from here last night. Lots of food, but not much flavor. I had orange chicken.. One slice of orange in the whole order and not much orange flavor (or any other either). Hubby had Szechuan Chicken. It had a very strong onion flavor - but not much other flavor. We also ordered Pot Stickers. They were big, but again - not very flavorful.\n\nAll in all, not worth the wait or the money. I guess it would do in a pinch, but not if I had any other options."
2,"So what is so great about this place. It is located in the middle of the Palazzo and has no atmosphere. We went for happy hour and got a $3 glass of their private label wine (It tastes like Rutherford groove which goes for $5 a bottle WS) \n\nTheir overpriced wine/spirits flights ($20-$40 a flight) are half price during happy hour, so happy hour makes the price for the flights not too laughable. \n\nI can see people stopping to get off their feet and have a drink, but I would not call this place a wine bar. It is just the seating area for the adjacent overpriced wine shop."
2,"The egg roll wasn't too bad but the house special chicken just seemed a little off and dry.  Also the fried rice had quite a few of those hard crunchy grains of rice and burnt eggs.  The service was incredibly fast for take-out so I would definitely go again, just maybe order something with beef or pork.  The prices are pretty hard to beat, $16 for two dinner combos!"
2,"The employees here are incredibly rude.  They act annoyed when you place an order, like why would you do such a thing?  The baked good I ordered had to have been a week old.  When I went told the guy at the register, he told me I could pick a new one.  Unfortunately they were all blocks of cement. He simply said sorry and watched me throw mine away.  Luckily he was kind enough to give me a refund when my fiance went back up and demanded it (despite angry mutterings by the nearby barista).  \n\nBecause of the good coffee and atmosphere, I'm giving two stars, not one."
2,The chain is great.   Cheesecake factory has a HUGE menu and prides itself on creating an amazing environment full of space. \n\nThis location (Green Valley) is really hit-or-miss from a service perspective.   If you are looking for something to eat around this area take the safe bet and go to Elephant Bar or PF Changs.   \n\nI have had servers at this location be real rockstars and then I have had folks who realllllllly seemed like they hated to be at work.   When you are spending almost $100 on a meal for you family you expect at least marginal service.
2,"We chose to have lunch at this buffet today because of the great reviews everyone is leaving here, however we were disappointed. We paid $79.99 for 2 and I wish we spent it at the nice restaurant.\n\nFood selection was very small. I love seafood and there was nothing of that sort. Just 3 types of sushi which I didn't risk eating as it didn't look fresh. Most of the food we ended up eating was really tasteless. Desserts were not tasteful either. I just don't understand what people are raving about. Maybe we just have high standards.\nWould not recommend this place."
2,"I really wasn't impressed. Over crowded. Servers are slow. Food bins were either empty or restocked with stuff other then what was posted. Mongolian BBQ - had great flavor, but the meat has bones in it, YUCK. Italian & Mexican were OK. The BBQ ribs about a B-. Just real average buffet. Not worth my time to return, when better buffets can be found closer to home."
2,"I don't get the fervor over this place. Our neighbors seem to like it a great deal, and we've given it 3-4 shots, but I've been disappointed with the food every single time. It's not often I'm disappointed by burgers.\n\nPrice points are nice, I suppose, but I think you'd be better off driving to In'n'Out or paying more at Zinburger, which is only about a mile away."
2,"I live around 6 blocks away & have never noticed! even driving by you will likely miss it: very tucked away, tiny & hidden.  Small & dark inside, little 'patio' sandwiched btwn 2 buildings.  Very limited wine choices. Seems to be a big draw with regards to staying open till 2am? (I must be old, not a selling point 4 me).  Staff & Owner very nice, but sorry, just no atmosphere happening here to entice me back?  All & all, no particular cons, nor any pros to rant nor rave about here.... sigh...."
2,"My brother recommend this place when he was in Vegas for his friend's wedding. He told me how much he love their chicken wings. So I gave this place a chance to see what's it about. It's pretty much like an Asian fusion place or more of a Korean spot. They have karaoke private stations in the back and a bar. When we went there it was really dead. We were their only customers. But the ambiance is cool. We ordered some fried pork cutlets, Korean bbq, sweet potato fries, shrimp tempura, watermelon soju, and of course their wings since it's the most popular there. But I've had better and cheaper of all of those food. Now, let's talk about their wings. They have I think 3 different flavors for the wings and we tried them all. The wings are chunky pieces. It's not like wingstop or buffalo wild wings size wings. But as far as taste goes, it's alright. Didn't really like it actually.. And as far as the service/staff, they were really nice and on point. But I'm not sure if that's really how it went down or if it's because they didn't have any other customers to pay attention to but us. I don't think I'd ever come back here unless I decide to give this place one more chance but I don't think I will."
2,"Ordered a banana nut muffin, received a blueberry muffin. When I spoke with the manager, she rudely asked me if I wanted blue berry or banana, when clearly I'm returning to exchange the blue berry muffin. \n\nFood was decent, just poor attitude/service when confronted about the issue of an error on their part.\n\nProbably would not come back to this specific location."
2,50 bucks for two adults and a kid. Way over priced breakfast. The atmosphere was great. The service was very slow. Thank goodness the drinks are self serve.
2,"I'm not sure why I thought going to ihop in the first place was a good idea. I went at lunch time, on a weekday because I was craving some pancakes. The place was mostly empty, but they still couldn't be bothered to have good service. I was sat at a table and waited, and waited.. finally after I stared down a waitress was I finally able to place an order. My food came and it was alright, not sure how anyone could mess up pancakes. I didn't see my waitress again until she brought the check. No \""how does your food taste?\"" or \""can I get you anything else?\"" Actually yes, I really wanted a glass of water but I couldn't get one until the check finally came. Avoid this place."
2,"One star for the decent chicken strips and fries with homemade ranch dressing, and one for the service cause the delivery guy was nice. However, the pizza crust tasted like stale leftover matzah. Then they cut it into little squares and you couldn't pick a piece up without making a mess. All I want is a good pizza pie and cut normal into slices! I just wasted $28 on a med pie and chx strips."
2,"Service was slow, even though the place wasn't that crowded for a  late Friday evening. We ordered drinks, chips and salsa, and Fundido.  We received the drinks. Waited longer that average. The Fundido appears, but not the chips and salsa or silverware. ...And we wait. We were finally able to flag down a waitress (not ours) and request napkins and silverware. Scurring, our waitress walked pass and we were able to inquired about the chips and salsa and placed our dinner order. The waitress (in no rush) eventually brought the salsa to the table, but no chips...WTH (duh!)  Drinks were great! Food was delicious! Service suck!!!"
2,"Alot of people think this place is a dog park. There is dog crap everywhere as you walk around the mile long concrete  path as most people seem to ignore the bags that are provided. I had a run-in with a large poodle owner also who thought she was special letting her dog roam around without a leash. I know giant poodles aren't dangerous, but I have seen pit bulls and bigger dogs off leash too. These snobs who live in North Scottsdale are pathetic and immature and think they are above the law. This is a soccer complex, so put your ugly dog on a lease and pick up your crap or maybe I will come over to your yard and drop a load right there too."
2,"Pricey and just mediocre in service, food quality and atmosphere. Went on Sunday, January 31, the last evening of the Dining Out Charlotte special event, dinner for $30.  Two couples, we brought our own wine, and bill still came to $100 per couple. And the three others with me all had the Ragout dish and ALL three were sick to their stomachs throughout that night into the next evening. There are way better restaurants in Charlotte for the price.  Footnote -- the restaurant was nearly empty due to the weather.  You would think the manager would have come by the table to ask us about our dining experience.  He or she never appeared...do they even care?"
2,"Harrah's does have a prime smack dab in the middle of the strip, walk out and get mobbed by people location, I'll give em that.\nThey've also held their own and stayed upto par with the Casinos spending Millions on remodeling and keeping current.\nHarrah's did nothing of that sort, they know their location is enough to keep them up there as one of the must visit places.\nMe, I think Harrah's sucks.\nIt's old and musty and seemingly in exactly the location where all the drunk kids stumble around outside.\nThe carpets are stained, the ceilings are low, not very inviting.\nBoth places I tried to eat at, Gorden Ramsey and KGB pissed me off so...sorry Harrah's i won't even bother walking through next time."
2,"BEWARE! This place adds 15% tip WITHOUT telling you! So for the late night gamblers high on drinks, they are very much likely to add their own 15% tip in the \""tip\"" line!! Unless they were like me, after leaving tip, went back to check the bill and found out the waiter already sneaked in the tip, yet still left the \""tip\"" line empty for you to add and sign!\n\nAnd i would left double tip had i been serviced well... BUT at this place you had to get up and get your own side dish! Yup, i wouldnt even want to leave 15% if i serviced myself half of the time!\n\nFood was okay, there were two flies flying around in the restaurant.. Burger King is cleaner."
2,"People sometimes say that this is the best buffet in town... *rude game-show buzzer*... wrong. Not too shabby, but really nothing to write home about. I was totally bugged when we went here during their transition (remodeling) phase and they seated us in a storage room with a makeshift food line and stainless steel spoons provided to use as serving utensils - they were so hot, no one could even hold onto them. I promise, the next time a place like this (upscale buffet) tries to pull something like that, I'm going to demand my money back. I don't like to be disrespected like that. Close down if you're going to compromise class... and safety, too... I burned my freaking fingers!"
2,This Casino is old. I really needs a remodel. It is connected to the Tram which you will have to walk to Aria *kind of a long walk* and then from Aria there is a tram to Vdara and Bellagio.
2,"Costumer service was slow. Took 15 minutes to get our waitress and 15 minutes for our drinks to come.\n\nSouth west wrap, my sister like her wrap, but needs a hint of spice, she said.\n\nBanana bread french toast, grandma said it was so sweet. The sauce was drenched when she got it. Definitely no need syrup for these bad boys. She liked her bowl of fruit better.\n\nVeggie Omlette with potatoes. VEGGIE, yeah. No veggies. More of cheese and egg whites. didn't finish it. It was too bland, but tapitio and ketchup made it better.  Haha.. my potato was over cooked and had so much season on it. My whole wheat bread tasted old and stale. Im over all disappointed.. shrugs.."
2,"Just because a restaurant has white tablecloths does not mean it has good food but reviewers of Flemings must be so impressed with the tablecloths that they overlooked the taste of food.  Worse restaurant I've been to in a while, and that includes the food I am forced to eat at the airport.   I had  fish, that tasted institutional - something off high school cafeteria menu. It was an insult to the sea.  The service was good, which is why this place got two stars and not one."
2,Too expensive!  I prefer other sub places like Port of Subs for the same price.  I like picking out my toppings and seeing what they are doing...\n\nThe staff was excellent though.
2,I don't get it.  Then again as a vegetarian who likes to eat healthy for the most part there is really nothing on the menu for me.\n\nTook the kids to get the chocolate brownie pie.  None of my three children really liked it.  Took about 15 minutes for them to make it also.
2,"Coming from Texas, I am extremely familiar with great mexican cuisine. Tex-mex has been a longtime favorite since the day I first had unlimited red and green sauce. That being said, my expectations may have been too high coming here. \n\n- The atmosphere was great. The decor made the place really come alive (very similar to many restaurants in Charlotte). You feel like you are in Mexico.\n\n- Sauce is solid, honestly nothing to rave about but it gets the job done.\n\n- The entree's are just really bland. \n1) My cousins enchiladas came out cold\n2) My enchiladas were just bland\n3) Nobody on our table (10+ people) came close to eating their food because it just lacked flavor. \n\nHonestly, I wouldn't come back here unless someone really wanted to go here and I had no choice. The positive is the staff is friendly and the place is nice."
2,"The people here are running more a business than a place for some Indian food. I observed the owner & manager to be very business minded & be cared to the customers with such perspective. \nThats different story, who cares if the food end up delicious, which isn't the case. Less than average taste, not all the items in Menu are available. The only advantage its at the Strip. Else I liked the food http://www.everestcuisine.net/, far better than in Tamba during my 3 day visit to Vegas."
2,"I wanted to love this place. I wanted to eat breakfast here each day of my trip. But my service was SO bad, that I couldn't return. And the food wasn't anything to write home about. The atmosphere is so nice.. a beautiful escape from the noise of the strip. I don't know if I didn't look rich enough to be dining here.. but that is how the server treated me.. and I was wearing a suit, not pajamas! I ordered the corned beef hash and the flavor was good but the texture was not. It was ground up so much that I don't think it could have been considered a hash. The service was just such a frustrating experience.. I actually think I waited for my check for almost 20 minutes after asking. I would be willing to give Verandah another chance for breakfast because of all the amazing reviews.. but not anytime soon."
2,"The service today really was disappointing and slow.  They only had one person that worked the cash register in the whole place and she was also restocking which took away from her register duties.  It took several mins just to get an acknowledgement and several more to place an order.  Funny thing I was the only person in line.  Normally, we never have any issues with this location."
2,"Had dinner with a party of 6.  Service was spectacular!  Wine suggestions were exactly what we were looking for.  Salad was very simple and plain with no \""wow\"" factor.  I'm a nice Italian girl so I figured I would order spaghetti bolognese.  This was highly suggested as the server stated the pasta was house made.  When it came out it reminded me of lunch room spaghetti.  The noodles were tasteless and too thick.  The sauce was ground beef and tomatoes.  I passed on dessert but the complimentary biscotti was a sweet little touch...\nI won't visit again..."
2,"I've been going to this office for 2 years and had several \""run in's\"" with Rosie a medical asst. She is very rude and always seem to be annoyed by me and my health questions. The last run in she treated me and my issues like I was a child looking for drugs we had words and now I've been asked not to come back to the office. Watch out for this asst...."
2,"Ok, I know lots of locals like Paradise Cantina, but I have to say I wasn't too thrilled when I went. We were with a group of friends on a Friday night and the restaurant had a fun, dive bar atmosphere, but the food just was 'meh'. I got the chicken tacos and dry doesn't even begin to cover the flavorless chicken that was crumbling in my hands along with the tortilla.\n\nThat said, the happy hour special was awesome - buy one drink, get the second drink free. I would definitely head here for your pregame, but don't make it your main event."
2,"I'll make this to the point\n\nthe bad:\n1. There are much better restaurants in this price range, SW being one.\n2. The food is overpriced for what you get.\n3. Don't sit on the couches on the wall, they're way over used. The table was at my chest and had to ask to be moved.\n4. The busser did the server's job, besides take orders.\n5. The server didn't introduce herself nor welcome us to the restaurant (not being picky, but many patrons expect this when you're paying $130 per person.)\n6. The hostess had to take our dessert order because the waitress was nowhere to be found, which is extremely irritating.\n7. I had to send back the scotch I wanted because they gave it to me with cocktail ice. This is completely unacceptable for a $22 scotch.\n\nThe good:\n1. The decor was very nice and not too bright or dark.\n2. They give out free appetizers, french fries, which are pretty good.\n3. The hostesses are very accommodating.\n4. Decent beers and excellent wines."
2,"The facilities were VERY VERY NICE. Extremely well kept, smelled great, area for children and it came with free stuff! Lots of free formula stuff. Which is cool. \n\nShe wasn't a terrible person. But to say she is the nicest woman I've ever met would be an understatement. We wanted it to be a surprise for us and she kind of made it seem like an outlandish request because a previous customer complained to her. I felt a little weird because having a gender surprise these days seems to be like it would be pretty normal IMO. \n\nPrices were good, although the \""potty shot\"" was extremely unclear. With that said, I do believe in her determination. She is experienced and surely saw the parts she said. However, the picture was not a classic shot and is very very unclear."
2,"Update: after posting my last review I was offered a free meal and a refund on the over charge. A wonderful gesture. We happily enjoyed the meal with much better service then. However, we were never given the refund. I had multiple emails saying they would refund it that night but nothing ever happened. It seems like that experience perfectly sums up Via Brasil, trying but falls short."
2,"Ambiance was nice.  Service was nice.  Drinks were good.  I had a green tea martini, pricey at $15 but normal for Vegas.  Food was...\""ok\"".  Way too pricey for what you are getting.  We left hungry.  I wouldn't go back to eat a meal but would go back for drinks /appetizers if nothing else was open."
2,"Had an open faced turkey sandwich that was terrible. Sliced deli turkey - and not even good deli turkey at that - covered with a salty, canned brown gravy.  Even the smashed potatoes were tasteless and watery, and couldn't save this meal.\n\nThe wait staff was friendly and attentive,  but describing the soup of the day as \"" kind of a broth, and it has vegetables\"" is not how one should be selling the soup.\n\nIf I come back again, I'll stick to burgers or sandwiches, and stay away from the dinner entrees."
2,"probably the weakest club that i have been to in vegas. we came on a sunday night because we got in for free and we were told it was popular. boy were we wrong, we should have stuck with our original plan to go to XS. the place barely filled up. it seemed more like a gambling lounge, which guys would love. there were tables for blackjack and poker and pretty girls in sexy bunny outfits dealing the cards. we did leave and came back past 12 it still was not crackin here. but we still were able to have some fun and found some cute guys to hang with.\n\nwe also got 3 comped drinks if you enter their playboy club model search. they dont let you know that until you fill out the paper and you have to take several head shots for them. but i guess it is worth the comped drinks."
2,My wife's food was cold. The baked beans were tasteless.   The service was nice and the waiter was friendly and did make sure my wife's meal was redone and hot.
2,I guess I'm spoiled in CA since I have more options.  The yogurt was too icy and the flavored ones were not tart enough.  This is nothing compared to Pinkberry.
2,I booked an appt today based on all of the good reviews.  My appointment was at 3pm. Did not get seated until 3:15. Nail tech did not start until 3:20.  The nail tech barely did any cuticle trimming and my 3 year old nephew could of done the callous buff better.  I brought my own base/top coat which apparently caused a problem for the nail tech to paint.  The color nail polish was painted unevenly and the sides of my nails were left unpainted. I have used my base and top coat many times and I never had this problem.  My nails were then placed under the UV lamps to dry. Left too long and was really hot.  Never really dried my nails.  The good that I can say is that they are very clean. I just think there is a huge variance between nail techs so if u get someone you like stick with them.  I will not be going back but they will have no trouble getting customers who don't know better  since they are across the street from Scottsdale quarter.
2,"Me and my hubby went there for a earlier dinner, the restaurant itself is nice, and clean ( new of course ) But why do you need 50+ server ( maybe even more) on a slow weekday? So, we were literately been watching, maybe stare the whole time,  because 98% of them have nothing to do but stand there and chatting.... super uncomfortable, and the manager was like whatever.  \uff29 think Ill stick to the Henderson's Lucille."
2,The restaurant looks fancy. The view was good. But the food was just so so. I had a scallop dish but I think the scallop is too salty and the corn rice with it was too rich and creamy. You can only eat them together. My BF's steak is only OK. The parking cost us 13 dollars for valet. It's not even count for valet cause they just parked the car in front of the hotel on the street. Usually these fancy restaurant should waive the parking fee even for valet. The meal were too rich that I did not want for desert.
2,"Poor inventory often times.  Went looking for a power supply and shelves are very sparse with stock.  if they have more in stock they should fill the shelves.  But to be out of 5 major brand models is not very good for business.\n\nLines are fairly quick most of the time.\n\nHelp in the aisles is virtually non existent.\n\nI often find situations where staff members are flirting with each other (or rather the men, old and young, staff members are hitting on the young female staff) rather than helping customers find things or answer customer questions.\n\nThe only reason for 2 stars at all is for their in-store pickup option from the website.  This is very good. however, many employees are dumbfounded how to complete the pick up process or where to find the online ordered items on their shelves behind the cash registers.  This is unacceptable training.\n\nPricing is not the best unless there is a rebate and the item is on sale already.  This is more often the case than not."
2,Thai house was good but not the best thai place I have had. I had the red curry chicken medium and it didn't seem to be spicy enough for being medium. Also it was pretty expensive.
2,"After reading the reviews here I was expecting a pretty good steak.  The meat quality was good (we ordered filets), but lacked any depth of flavor.  We ordered a bearnaise sauce and crab meat side, the sauce tasted like it was from a packet, and the crab was dry.  BF subbed the lobster bisque for his salad, and again it was super bland.  Mashed potatoes were OK, but nothing to rave about.  Dessert may be good there, but we were too underwhelmed with the meal to try it.  Perhaps they were having an off night, but next time I'm craving steak we will go elsewhere- I'd seriously rank Outback above this spot."
2,Le jus d'orange trop cher et pas froid\nLa mauvaise assiette\nService extra long\nL'endroit est tr\u00e8s joli mais malheureusement tr\u00e8s d\u00e9cevant aussi
2,"For the amount of money we spent on a Terrace Suite I was expecting exceptional service. We checked in on a Friday and called room service within 15 minutes of arriving to our room to request extra towels and hangers.  After about 45 mins of waiting around we had to put in a second call and was told this time \""I'm not sure what happen\"" so we left, we didn't want to waste another hour sitting in our room.  Upon returning to our room later that afternoon we called again to have someone come fix our air that wasn't working properly and yet again no one showed up. It was so hot in our room we had to sleep with the door open to the 103-degree heat. Upon check out when we were asked how our stay was we again complained about the air and bad response time and was told \""Sorry to hear that\"" I was completely disappointed with the response of such a lavish hotel. At the least they could have offered a small discount. I even called back the day I returned and ask for a discount and was told I needed to request one at checkout and I explained we did voice our frustration when we checked out and reminded her that we were told \""Sorry to hear that\"".  All in all other than the terrible service and horrendous sewage smell on the first floor near the Bellagio entrance visually the hotel is amazing."
2,"This is only about their chili.\nWorst chili ever. I was so under whelmed that I couldn't wait to write a review. This review is only for the chili. Looked great but that first bite was just terrible. It was so salty but sweet at the same time. It seems like they just opened a can of ketchup, put some beans and meat into it and called it a day.  \n\nI had a short stop and just wanted to grab something quick, should've grabbed a sandwich somewhere else instead. The experience of ordering (take out) wasn't great either. Right outside it smelled really foul, like a dirty bathroom but it's not coming from the bathroom. A flight attendant walked by and was asking her collegue \""Why does it always smell so bad here?\"" \n\nThere are many more options and they all cost about the same. Next time I'll know to try somewhere else."
2,"Recently purchased pork shoulder Boston butt from Sam's and the package was not properly marked. The package didn't indicate that the product was bone in. This package of meat sold for$2.48/lb. Same product from Frys sells for$1.99/lb. I don't see the discount savings. I called manager and was told product came from vendor and Sam's had no control over labeling,  of course manager didn't offer to give me a credit for my purchase. That was nearly $5.00 difference,  guess I'll have to be more vigilant of what I purchase from Sam's in the future."
2,I worked for great clips and it was the worst experience ever.  Corporate expects you to do a 15 minute haircut.  That is do-able.  I can do a pretty good cut in 15 minutes.  Of course that doesnt include any blow dry or style after.  The problem for me was that the store managers expect you to do 8 minute cuts.  There were so many stylist that did 8 min (or less) cuts but they had a ton of re-do's.  I never had re-do's but I refused to rush a haircut.  I got alot of crap for not rushing.  I hated the job.  If you are the type that is in a huge rush this may be a good place for you.  Just dont expect a perfected cut.
2,"L'a\u00e9roport de Las Vegas est en pleine ville. Donc \u00e0 l'atterrissage ou au d\u00e9collage, il est astucieux d'\u00eatre pr\u00e8s d'un hublot.\n\nL'a\u00e9roport en lui-m\u00eame n'est vraiment pas terrible. Quelques machines \u00e0 sous, un fast food et un pizza hut se battent en duel. L\u00e0 aussi, le Duty free n'est pas exceptionnel : bref, pour une ville comme Vegas, il y a des progr\u00e8s \u00e0 faire !"
2,"Waited close to 15 minutes for a side salad and a kids meal.  I had to go and get it myself from the counter.  Huge crowd of people at the counter, no one directing anyone to the next available cashier. Very unfriendly workers."
2,"2 stars and that's just for their omelette station. The rest is blah. For the price that they charge, go somewhere else!"
2,"My 2 girl friends and I came here on a Friday night the weekend of Easter before hopping over to Surrender at the Wynn because they were having a special, free champagne & well drinks for ladies. \n\nIt was all of our first experience as 21 year-olds & we were all excited to experience and soak in all that this Sin City has to offer.\n\nHowever, I soon quickly realized there really isn't anywhere to sit unless we had a table. It was nice that part of this venue was outside so when it gets too got inside, people can sort of hang out in the patio area. \n\nThe size of this place is actually pretty small and it was a bit hard to maneuver around across the room to the bathroom because there were reserved tables and sofas in the center of this place where people were dancing and standing around socializing.. \n\nI don't know if I'd ever go back just to hang out here, maybe if they had that special for free drinks again.. but other than that nope.\n\nThe only plus side about this place was that it was a good way to start out our night with free drinks and then just stroll over to Surrender."
2,"I'm surprised by the number of good reviews for J & G.  I've been there twice and felt the same each time - mediocre food, nothing special at all.  You would think The Phoenician hotel would ensure they have a great restaurant but J&G will not be on my list of places to repeat.  Sure, it's a nice space but the food is blah, expensive and certainly not on par with the costs."
2,It's clean and the wait staff is helpful but it's just sad that the food keeps going down hill. I wish they would look at this and fix it quickly. I came out to Vegas about 5 times a year and all the other good places you could find.
2,Flew two days after Christmas and there was basically one security line that took an eternity to get through. Technically there were multiple lines but we were told that one was first class & priority (Checkpoint C) and the other (Checkpoint D) we couldn't use for some other reason and we were told to go down to Checkpoint E. I had arrived at the airport with two hours to spare and ended up running for my plane. I've flown out of Charlotte dozens of times but have never seen the staff as unprepared for holiday travel as this. At least they finally have short term parking again.
2,Service was slow and it wasn't busy at all. Food was not so good. Only good food was the seafood.
2,"I gave this 2 stars for  the pizza only great pizza way to much money for 10 in pizza., service sucks!!!!!!!!!!!! got only 1 glass of water never a refill, table next to us got food in 10 min.\nantipasta salad, a joke waited 30 min for sliced meat cheese and olives on a cutting board, no lettuce, the  young and not to smart waitress did not tell us there was no lettuce."
2,"To be fair, the food was pretty decent. But it took far too long to eat a simple lunch here. We sat at 12:30  when we were hungry and got our food at 1:40 by which time I had already passed the point of being hungry. It was odd as several tables around us who were seated after us were able to get their food - and some were even able to finish their entire meals - before we so much as glimpsed ours. Lunch without drinks set us back $100, and while I don't mind paying a lot for a good experience, this was not worth the Benjamin we dropped. I would take your business elsewhere if I were you, like we plan to do going forward."
2,"I had fonder memories of this place...I went over Halloween weekend with a bunch of friends because it was too early for any nightlife to begin. A lot of the games I wanted to play were broken (including all of the Time Crisis systems), some shooting games had messed up light guns, the air hockey tables were out of service, the list goes on. I also managed to shut off the escalator as we were leaving...but that's not a fault of Gameworks.\n\nDefinitely not as fun the second time around, but maybe that's because I'm now a little older and a little wiser. There was one saving grace though, the dinosaur hunting game. You walk around hunting various breeds of dinosaur, and you even get a rocket launcher for when the SHTF. The other not-so-bad was the driving game with 4 big-screen TVs."
2,Expensive for some lousy NY-style pizza. Cost $35 for 2 larges! The pizza itself was greasy and fairly untasty. Better off with Barro's or hungry howie's.
2,"We waited an hour for our hamburgers and they were wrong. The hamburger delivered to the table next to us... also wrong. Sure they made up for it, but what if there had been an allergy? The kitchen is just a mess. \n\nThe hamburger looks wonderful, they try to make it look like art, but unfortunately this makes it extremely frustrating to eat, bigger than your mouth and then falls apart. The patty was dry and split while eating ending up in a pile on the plate. The cheese curds for the poutine weren't fresh enough to squeak.\n\nThe restaurant is very loud. Service was good, too bad the back of the house isn't. Might be fine if they fix the back of the house and start concentrating on the food instead of the presentation. And I certainly didn't go out for dinner expecting to be frustrated by the whole thing."
2,"If I could review the food separately from the service, then my review would be much more glowing.  On the 3 times that we've attempted to dine here the service has consistently been pretty painful.  I had to wait 30 minutes and ask 4 times to get my diet coke delivered to the table, after our first round of food was on the table.  They offer an all you can eat Simon-style brunch on the weekend, which turns out to be all you can wait.  Service is consistently not remotely fast or organized.  At the brunch, they often forget some of our orders that never arrive and servers are hard to flag down for drink refills or ordering.\n\nOn my last visit as I washed my hands in the ladies room a female server busted through the door stuffing her face with a pastry over the bathroom sink.  Their kitchen whips up some pretty yummy fare, but until Republic improves their service issues, we will not be returning."
2,"David David David....Two sides to every coin.  Mr. Copperfield has acquired a lifetime of success doing \""illusions\"" or tricking people into believing one thing while he does another (I'm not terribly fond of magic, but can be entertained).  You can tell he's been doing it wayyyyyyyyyyyyy too long, he just didn't seem into it............at all.  It's as though he was on auto-pilot.  \n\nThere were a few cool tricks, especially when the car appears on the stage (sweet ride btw).  \n\nHowever, I laughed quite heartily through out the show.  He had a few parts that almost caused me to fear bladder problems.  Would I have paid for tickets if I didn't get them comped? Umm, no. \n\nBefore he 'appeared' on stage, there was a tedious \""DAVID COPPERFIELD\"" tribute video, it was cool the first few minutes...but daaaaang dude, ease up, we don't need to see every SINGLE show clip that your name was mentioned in.\n\nIt was ok.  I think he's a handsome older man, but his fake hair was awfully distracting.  Thirty minutes of the show was spent trying to figure out if it was sprayed on or astro-turf."
2,"Not the best mariscos....portions are small. I got the breaded shrimp and they  had no flavor or seasonings...very disappointed,  will never come back....Everyone was telling me about this seafood restaurant ( how it's the best) ....i was very disappointed, it's ok cause i wont be back....the music is so loud ....i really don't understand why it's so loud, what's up w/ that, how am i supposed to carry a conversation ....so i had to wait for music to stop, it was soooooo annoying ...NEVER AGAIN."
2,"Trust me, you're much better off eating at Panda Express.\n\nWent here because some Yelpers said it was a decent Chinese place on the strip. Repeat, the strip.\n\nFirst off, the location sucks. Yes, it may be in the Venetian, but it's in some odd corner where the smell of smoke is intense and you're looking at nothing but Sportsbooks.\n\nWe were seated promptly but it took about half an hour for water and menus. The food was honestly forgettable. Yes, there was variety, as well as Dim Sum, and the quality of ingredients was good, but it didn't live up to its claim of authenticity, nor did it taste spectacular. We had the XO Shrimp and the Seafood Pan Fried Noodles. And it was overpriced as hell.\n\nLike I said, you're better off eating at Panda Express somewhere in Henderson, or in Vegas if there is one. Sure it's a chain, but the food is freshly made, hot, and tasty.\n\nTwo stars for bad environment, mediocre food, and slow service.\n\nAnother fine review by S.G.\nWhoop, whoop, whoop!"
2,"My first problem was that I couldn't find the entrance of the place...  The wait staff is very young and polite but can be spotty.  I sat there for a good 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged me.  \n\nThe Cesar salad was prepared in the middle of the dining room and it was quite fresh.  I had steak frites for dinner (how original...)  The quality of the meat is just ok, but for the price I paid it seems fair.  The fries are the best part - it's freshly fried and they come back to offer you seconds if you want."
2,"A nice room at a premium price, so it's what you would expect really.  The quality of the food is what let this place down.  I am pretty sure at breakfast I got 3 (count them!) mushrooms.  The ceasar salad I ordered from room service was pretty slimy while the soup was very bland (and again hardly any bread).  The gym is also pretty antiquated, thoguh I suppose its good they've wedged one in."
2,Actually went to Surf city Bar & Grille but it's more a bar so we ended up in Que Mas attached . Well it's mexican food nothing special. Nothing great to talk about. Had to try once won't go back.
2,"This is a location specific review.\n\nI've attempted to come to this location a couple occasions.  I live closer to the Biltmore location and love it.  The atmosphere and food is great.  So, I was happy that there is a location near my in laws (it's always exciting to be able to eat healthy and enjoy their company).  We went for father's day, it wasn't all that impressive and the service was pretty lackluster, but my meal was good.\n\nI went again with my MIL a few weeks ago for a late lunch.  The place was swarming and our electronic notifier never went off.  We waited for about half an hour before I went in and asked if we were ever going to be seated.  And then I got attitude.  And the service was SO SLOW.  It wasn't particularly happy, friendly, or polite.  There is a vibe at this location and I don't like it.\n\nI'll keep my Biltmore location thank you very much.  And will not be going back to this TFK again.  It's a waste of time and money."
2,"I'm being generous with two stars. As we walked out, everyone in our party said \""worst meal and the worst service in the Scottsdale / Phoenix metro area.\""\n\nI've read the other posted reviews and wonder if we ate at the same place.  I even called the two other couples who dined with us and they couldn't believe the praise.\n\nLowlights.\n1)  I don't drink, so this was not a problem for me, but they didn't have the mix to make a cosmopolitan and another friend in our party asked for three different wines (listed on their list) but they didn't have them.  Finally, he settled on one of their wines, which, and I quote,  \"" was acceptable'. \n\n2) Executive chef was on a cell phone ( on and off) throughout our meal.  Standing, I might add 10 feet in front of our table.  As the service was so slow, we wondered whether he was calling in for supplies?\n\n3) Served bread drowning in olive oil.\n\n4) slow service\n\n5) 6 entrees were ordered.  Only one person in our party liked what they were served\n\nHighlights:\nNONE.\n\nWho are the people who wrote the favorable the reviews ... paid PR personnel?"
2,"I thought this place was okay - they did have a quite a few veggie options.\n\nI settled for an asian noodle dish with thin slices of grilled tofu. I thought there was too much of the brown sauce and a bit salty for my tastes.\n\nThere were only four other tables that were seated when I arrived - my waiter was attentive and struck up a conversation. Service was good.\n\nI'd recommend this place if you live close by, but not if you have to drive across town to get to it (which I did)."
2,Freaky hotel. Needed a cheap hotel for new year weekend and this was it. Bad idea. \n\nPro\nEasy check in\nNo resort fee\nEasy access to freeway\nNice front desk people\nWetzel pretzel\n\nCon\nFunky smell\nAsked for renovated room but got a dilapidated room - eh\nShower head super loud\nDirty coffee maker\nThe carpet looks gross\nTv is awkwardly positioned ... Blocking the window/view\n\nUsed room for 10 hrs... It was okay....
2,"i was excited to eat here because it was highly recommended. the service was excellent and the food was pretty good. it's not the best fried chicken i've ever had but it was decent. it was a little greasy though. \n\nhowever, i went with a large group of 7 and so far 3 of us felt sick later. i haven't checked with 3 other folks from my party but, my mother in law, my husband and i all felt very nauseous  and had the runs afterwards."
2,"Definitely caters to a particular crowd. If you are in your 40's and want a place to hangout and not get too vegas-craaaazy than this would be your place. Went here for my moms 40th bday and thats just what I got from what I saw. Drinks are about $12 bucks a piece too. Yucky. It did get a little rowdier at night, but definitely doesn't cater towards the 20 something crowd."
2,"I had a pap done recently and I wasn't very pleased with them. I waited maybe 30-45 mins past my appt time. The staff weren't very friendly, and I don't even remember my doctors name- she was kinda nice, but i felt as if she was rushed... I kept asking questions, she'd answer but she just seemed like she just couldn't wait to get out of there to attend to another patient. So needless to say, I dont plan on going back."
2,My husband and I had brunch. The brunch was mediocre at best. The huevos rancheros were tasteless. The clientele was much older than expected. I've been to Six Penn Kitchen for drinks and was happy. Brunch was just disappointing. Stick to Big Burrito or other little guys... Six Penn is only good for drinks.
2,"Decent food and great atmosphere. They seem a bit short staffed though. Waited two hours after being promised 40 minute wait time. Then took 10 minutes for drinks to hit our table and then 40 minutes for food to hit the table. People (family of 3) were seated after us (5 friends) and served their food first. The prices were ok, but just put off by the long wait. They can customize a lot of the food to tailor your spice preference. Would probably not go back to be honest."
2,Great selection of beer!  Prices are kind of high and the food is a disaster!  Our service was not much better than the food.  Big disappointment.
2,"This place is great if you want a mess of greasy, stringy meat soaked in way too much tzatziki. I wanted to take out my stomach and hose it off after eating here."
2,"Don't let House of Cards fool you, there's no decent barbecue joint in Washington DC. So when my Texan friend who has been living in Montreal for a decade told me about a BBQ joint he had been meaning to try - I was in. After all, I was at 4 poutines in 3 days and even as a native Quebecois in town just for a few days, I needed a break. \n\nFrom the very strict \""wait outside\"" policy (I went inside to look at the menu, and I was told to \""take a picture of it and GTFO\"") to the waiter who literally splashed us with coleslaw (everywhere on our shirts - didn't apologize) to the ridiculous prices ($20 or a half rack of ribs, with one side, seriously?), Icehouse screamed attitude. \n\nTheir food better be good then. Right? Not really. Popcorn shrimp had amazing breading, with definite Asian influences with the sweet sauce. The ribs were fall off the bone. Good stuff. The fried chicken had also great batter, but the chicken itself had probably been prepared too long and it was dried DRIED. For my friend, all was saved when they brought the corn bread and potato salad (vinegary, thick, excellent). \n\nFor someone in severe BBQ withdrawal, it was fine. I guess that sums it up. \n\nNote: Posters of shiner bock and all around - and yet you don't serve it? Shame on you."
2,"Service kinda sucked, so did the food. It's a meal though, and if someone else is paying, why complain? I wouldn't go there again though."
2,"Attention South Scottsdale:\n\nFry's Grocery store looking for customers.  Must meet at least one of the following criteria, preferably more than one:\n\n1)  Willard Scott must have wished you a Happy Birthday at least once.\n2)  You must prefer to ride around on a motorized cart not because you are disabled, but because you are at a comfortable weight of 350 lbs.\n3)  Must be willing to hold up the pharmacy line for an eternity discussing every ailment you and your cousin Ethel have ever had, and have no knowledge of insurance whatsoever.\n4)  You must steer your cart as bad as you do your Buick in the parking lot.\n5)  Must consider the middle of a shopping aisle a suitable place for social interaction and bingo.\n6)  You must be a cheap ass and appreciate Fry's prices are lower than nearby markets.\n\nSadly, I fall into the latter category.  See you next week Fry's."
2,"I've been to Sushi Kim few times over the years and every time I've gone there the food and service hasn't lived to it's reputation of being one of the best Korean restaurant atleat in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe food is okay.. service is mediocre and staff ... not the friendliest :)\n\nSo, if anyone asks me to recommend a good korean or a sushi place... you can say this will definitely not make the list."
2,"The atmosphere was great, the biscuits with the jam (I'm not a bread lover) was pretty good BUT do you know what turned me off...this dish I ordered that was supposed to be...I don't know what it was but it was eggs on the bottom with shredded beef on top. Least, to say complete turn off and I haven't been back since. The grits tasted like they were cooked in milk...wasn't a fan. I've had better brunch."
2,i came looking for what I thought were standard items in larger Asian grocery stores and was disappointed.  Mekong and Lee Lee on Dobson have much larger selections (vegetables/herbs/meats/seafood) at cheaper prices. Too bad because I live so close to Super L.  Maybe I'd come back if I wanted some Peking Duck or Roasted Pork from the deli.
2,"Wandering around the Strip on a chilly Christmas Eve, I was EXTREMELY hungry and suffering from intense sugar withdrawal. We had just emerged from the arcade in New York New York (not worth it; it will eat all your coins and leave you poor and desolate) when I saw It'Sugar!\n\nI've always had a childhood fondness for old-fashioned candy-stores (i.e any store dedicated to candy), probably stemming from my early love of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. So, of course, I was hooked.\n\nLooking back, the candy was insanely overpriced. I mean, yes, it IS Vegas but.. really? There's no way a handful of gummies should add up to $5. What is this nonsense |:"
2,"On a floor with a pool table and much pricier restaurants, DOCG is...very much okay. The food isn't quite as expensive as its compatriots, the offerings not quite as extravagant or interesting. \n\nSure the bread was nice at the beginning, but the best part were those pre-packaged bread sticks. Like me some crunch. \n\nI ordered the DOCG pizza. It's got a fried egg, this year's pork belly. It's got truffle on it, now for the common man. The waiter even breaks the eggs and smears it over the pizza. I am salivating from the smell of truffles and baby chickens. \n\nBut the TASTE? Where did the taste go. There is no truffle kick. There isn't even a truffle whimper. I am so sad. I spend the rest of the dinner staring at Comme Ca, drinking wine."
2,I visited Wing Stop again after 9 months or so. It was as good as I remembered only less so as in it wasn't that good last time and was less good this time I tried the Cajun sauce and I don't really know what it is supposed to be but it was kind of hot and kind of buffalo sauce and kind of jerk-herby and hard to pin down like this sentence it was a little aimless in it's flavor and just didn't do much for me so this was probably my last visit to Wing Stop.  Yup.
2,"They have have all of the top of the line equipment.  Everytime I go the store, I find what I need.  However I run into more problems here than solutions, starting with extremely high prices.  I can find cheaper costs at everyone of Tempe acarmea's competitors, whether the product is for purchase or rent.  I have yet to have a visit in which their pompous employees don't strut about, telling me they knowneverything [that I already know as well].  It is almost as if they think they are the only persons in the world to ever use a camera.  I once took my film camera in to replace a battery, and the clerk put the thing in upside down.  If there were a 1-10 scale for customer service, Tempe Camera would fall at a -6."
2,"A concert venue without booze? How can it be? Those were my thoughts when I went to a local music showcase here a month ago and realized I was going to have to watch a show without my trusty beer in my hand. The horror!\n\nSince they don't have a bar, the venue attracts that all-ages crowd, which translates to under 21. I'm not a fan of being packed in with the mini Pete Wentz and Avril Lavigne's of this world so I was miserable in this small spot.\n\nIf you're underage, you'll probably dig it here. It is a great place to see the up-and-coming indie rock bands. If you're 21-or-over, just be prepared to do this without a drink in hand.\n\n\n\n\n It's usually packed with a very young crowd and the small venue doesn't serve any alcohol. A concert veny"
2,Got this though Hilton honor promotion and not impressed with this hotel when we checked in our room. I'll stick to the signature at mgm grand hotel now on. Feels like I'm staying in park inn hotel here.
2,"i wanted to give this event 1 star but the novelty forced me up to 2 stars. \n\nABSOLUTE GENIUS!!!! the event organizer got people (me) to pay to run 1 minute in front of scared rodeo cows. a complete loss of 25 bucks. and to make it even more painful, not even a t-shirt! why? because they ran out of t-shirts. that means every runner at the 2pm and after would get a crappy red bandanna...worlds most expensive bandanna! and they ran out of safety pins to pin the numbers. there's a cvs right up the street ya'll. \n\ncomplete debacle of any organization. they didn't check ID's or vouchers. most people just sort of walked right in and many did the run without even paying (they were bragging about it). but why would they pay, when nobody really checked anything! lets go a step further...\""no drinking in the corral\""...sure, but get wasted before and proceed to harass the cowboys and the bulls during the run. \n\nwe even saw two of the cowboys almost come to blows...they were yelling and swinging their lasso's at each other like they were about to start a fight with each other. \n\nugh, what a shame. this could've been such a cool event. i loved the costumes and the band playing (although after the run, most people left until the next start time)."
2,"Even though Pickles was a local business, the food is worse than a chain restaurants'. \n\nPickles IS closing. Goodbye and so long. And on July 1st, it is going to be a seamless transition to another locally owned restaurant called... ...sorry, my lips are sealed!\n\nEdit 6/23 : Oh - the story is out: http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2007/06/22/its_all_greek_area_staple_sold_after_"
2,"Not a good cupcake at all. I don't use a knife and fork on a cupcake ever, so I tried to take a bite of this thing and the entire icing section fell off like snow sliding off a roof. Plus, the one bite destroyed the whole cake portion turning the cupcake into a bunch of crumbles. Cupcake disaster again as that is what you get with mass produced cupcakes. Do you really need to put a sign on the door saying to close your door because it will keep our cupcakes fresher? These cupcakes just don't stay fresh sitting in that cabinet all day. There must be a better way to sell cupcakes to the public because Sprinkles did not cut the mustard. The cupcake was a seasonal Smores with marshmallow icing and graham cracker crumbs. It was inventive, but after attempting to eat this thing, it was totally not worth the $3.78 price tag."
2,"I read the other reviews and realise that I probably chose the wrong dish.\nBut the shepherd's pie was awful, too much mash and very little meat.\nShame because what little meat was there was tasty.\nMy company's salad looked unappetizing but she said it was OK, not great but OK.\nGoing there early on a Monday evening was also a mistake almost empty and so the lack of ambiance was way too apparent.\nAnyway fish and chips on Friday night is propably a good bet."
2,The bread was served toasted and the reason why is because it was stale.  The crust was burned. On a good note the oil that was served with the bread was good and spicy. I ordered the sea scallop appetizer which was disappointing.  The bottom was charred and had a charcoal taste.   The couscous that was served with the scallop was very good. The Bass was very good but it was very disappointing how they prided themselves on deboning and there were zillions of bones.  When I mentioned the number of bones of the fish to the waiter he changed his tune about how perfect the deboning was and said what do you expect from a small fish they just have lots of bones in them. For dessert they only had a choice of yogurt or fresh fruit.  I ordered the fresh fruit and it was okay but a little bit on the boring side for a fancy restaurant. The waiter surprised us with a complimentary extra dessert of baklava this is probably the worst baklava I've ever had in my entire life. The entire center was dried out and was like concrete.  There's was hardly anything soaking in honey.
2,"Prime time location, and they know it.\n\nYet another older guard restaurant that realizes it has people roped in before they know it.  The place looks nice and is possibly the best location during the summer especially in the city.  I have always steered clear of Roland's because of an assumption.  But....the wife and her friend wanted a \""lobster roll\"" so I was roped into going.  I opted to just drink a draught.  They got one of their famous lobster rolls and immediately were underwhelmed.  The sandwich was dwarfed by a mountain of handcut fries (the best part).  It also came with a limp pickle speer and a small condiment cup of coleslaw?!  The roll itself was lobster, but was fishy tasting and had no sauce?!  There was maybe 3ozs of fishy lobster on the roll.....Pathetic.\nService was decent and my draught and few fries got this place the extra star it deserves.\n\nGo to Wholey!!!!"
2,"Hey, don't advertise that you deliver when you do not.  I live 1.5 miles away and my address is out of range?  You may want to spend less money advertising about your amazing delivery service and invest in a few cars and drivers."
2,"I've since had two more haircuts from Richard. The second haircut was great, but styled horribly. When I left I literally looked like I was wearing a wig from the early '90's. Once I was able to fix it myself and style it totally differently than he intended, I really loved it. The third haircut was just awful: styled awful, looked strange. I just hate it, and I'm not sure what to do about it. I'm now on the look out for a new haircutting home!"
2,"After  a concert at Stage AE my boyfriend and I needed a place to rest our aching feet.  We sauntered across the road to The Pittsburgh Grille.  I think the decor is very nice and the bar has several interesting and colorful sports mural adoring the hallway walls.  It appears that they have every inch of wall space in the bar area and dining area covered in flat screen tvs.  It would be over kill any where else but since this location is right next to the stadium I can respect the concept.  I was impressed that this place has a cigar bar, that's something I haven't seen since I was on a cruise.  I like that I think it adds a touch of class. This restaurant is plush and comfortable. \n\nWe only stayed for one drink although I would have liked to have a few more.  There was patron in there screaming obscenities at a hookey game. That the Penn's weren't even playing in...  She was the only one yelling and at the top of her lungs too. While the rest of the bar was trying to have a good time.  One other thing I didn't care for is that the bar tender was too busy flirting to even notice that our glasses were left empty for over 5 minutes. Mind you there were only about 6 people in the room. I understand tips must be made, but not at the expenses of other customers receiving good service."
2,"I was so hopeful to find a good BBQ place. I heard great things about this place but wanted to wait until the lines went down from it being new. Well, I am so sad. Shared a brisket and a turkey sandwich along with sides of coleslaw, potato salad and a cobbler with my mom. \nThere was a really bad propane taste to the turkey.  The brisket was ok. Not anything to rave about. The BBQ sauce you add yourself at the table, which the spouts were clogged.  \nNow I really thought that they would have some good potato salad and coleslaw being a BBQ place. I was very wrong.  Not homemade.  Tasted like any store bought deli products.  Ewe. \nI guess that I had high hopes for the cobbler. Was kinda scared to try it after the salads. Yep disappointed.  I have actually had better frozen store bought. \nI hate to do a bad review but really if the food was better I'd totally give it a great review.  I think the whole concept they have is cool and the decorations are totally western BBQ cool. Even the patio for when it cools down would be great.  But you don't go there for the decorations."
2,"Meh. I've experienced better.\n\nI can't claim to be a connoisseur of Hawai'ian food, so to say I've experienced better, I'll have to say that as a generality.  Better quality, quantity, and priced food is out there.  For what it is, it's not bad.\n\nI had the combination BBQ plate for a sampling.  It included some thinly sliced beef, ribs, and chicken along with two scoops of rice and one scoop of macaroni salad.  Really it wasn't as much food as that may sound, but reasonable.  The ribs very obviously came from a cheaper, older animal, and the chicken is all dark meat (so make no delusions of it being healthier).  Basically they were all thin cuts to quickly grill, sauce, and serve.  So in terms of expediency, I'll give them kudos there.  Oh, and don't expect anything more out of the cashier other than giving your order due to that language barrier I oh so enjoy (seriously)."
2,The eel roll was good. So was the spicy salmon roll. But that Los Vegas roll was no good. I could not taste anything but cream cheese and rice! Bleghhh. Kona grill was definitely better. And surprisingly cheaper.
2,"Except for the one lady \""Ashley\"" (she's only messed up once), this place is a mess... I really need to stop going here instead of writing bad Yelp reviews."
2,"Started on the top floor and almost forked out 24$ for a bag of M&M. My wife started filling up the bag. Lots of cool colors, but whatev. By the end there was a rude lady who worked there hollering, \""Don't forget, it 7.99 a lb.?\"" I was floored. Are You F---in' Kindding???\"" We quickly hid the bag we filled behind some other overpriced M&M's. heehee.. I mean c'mon, it M&M's. What warrants it to have its' own 4 story place? Geeez..."
2,Here we go another Americanized Mexican restaurant kind of a copy cat of Garcias but not as good .. Food is decent rice is horrible and bland beans are beans and salsa is just that salsa. Had the Pollo Fundido which is a green chile chicken chimi cover in sour crean and cheddar cheese melt over the top. It was ok had better at Garcias and El Norteno. Just wasn't impressed at all with the quality and look of the place . Time to remold and redo some of them dishes .
2,"Food is great.  Service, wait times, and parking Sucks!\n\nI love the healthy and sustainable concept and the food was above average.  I have been to D'Lish three times, and have had horrible experiences with service, and having to wait 10-15 minutes for \""fast food\"".  I understand that quality food takes time to make, but they need some serious help! I am beginning to think that the owners are stubborn and don't want to pay for more help.  I was also overcharged for my food on every occaison, and was so frustrated with the cashier, and the pressure of the long line of people waiting to order that I just said \""screw it\"".\n\nBased on food alone, I would give this place 4 stars.  But the bad service brings my rating down to 2 stars.  I hope that this place gets their act together because I would enjoy their food more with better service.  I also think they should be open later than 4pm.  Seriously, who eats a meal at 4pm?"
2,The employees here are unbelievable.  Literally watched one wrap up my burrito by squeezing out all of the sour cream then rolling it in it...plus my friends margarita took seriously 5 minutes to make.
2,"Sorry Sinobi. For awhile I could put up with the not-so-special sushi in lieu of the far superior offerings at Penn Ave Fish Company --the only other sushi place that I know of near my place of work downtown. But the meager, sad looking \""rainbow roll\"" with teeny-tiny strips of nothing looks like fish bait. Never again will I fork over my money for something I could get at a convenience store. Owners: Please take the time to  read these reviews and put out quality sushi! It would be great to have more sushi options near market square. $13 bucks later and my stomach is still grumbling..."
2,"I made the mistake of ordering from this place twice! I guess thinking it might have gotten better the second time around. I was very wrong!!! The food is extremely over-priced and completely tasteless!!! I will NEVER eat there again! I was also told that I could not get a side of teriyaki sauce, even though I ordered a chicken teriyaki bowl and a beef bowl. Thankfully I didn't get extra sauce, it was disgusting on the chicken and beef bowl."
2,"We were really looking forward to some good Irish grub, unfortunately, it didn't happen here. The Shepherd's Pie \""gravy\"" was watery and tasteless, and there wasn't much meat. The irish stew was cold and and bland. The wait staff was nice, but service was lacking. Everything took a long time, and the most disappointing was dessert. Though the bread pudding was good, we asked for ice cream on it,  and the waitress waited too long to bring it to our table so the ice cream was almost completely melted. Won't be returning."
2,"Came here only for the bar.Don't order a dirty martini unless you know what you're getting into. It was straight up gin and a bad idea. Noobs. \n\nPear martini was really delicious, but didn't make up for the rest. Tokyo tea wasn't very stiff, and appletini was easy on the 'tini. (I had to say it, thank you Dr. John Dorian.)\n\nBartender/waitress was hurrying us out at 11pm on a Saturday night. Wtf. She took away our candle! Yes, I put that in the yelp review."
2,"Meh... this place used to be JJ's Top of the Swamp and has since been recently remodeled.  My sister and I thought we would check it out for lunch.\nAtmosphere... typical bar... nothing really noteworthy.  Seems like maybe they are still in midst of the remodel... sister noticed the floor near the ladies restroom seemed a bit suspect and in need of some repair.  The food prices seemed reasonable, However once again... nothing really too noticeable about the menu; typical deep fry bar fare.  My sister got the blackened chicken melt... which she said was pretty good.  I ordered the Yeti burger... yes that is correct...Yeti.  It could be pretty good.  The waitress asked how I would like it prepared.  I am at a loss as to why she asked when the burger came out over well done and dry.  It also comes with a fried egg... well... a solid fried egg.  Our waitress was nice and seemed amiable.  Maybe they are still working stuff out with the menu or the cook was having an off day...\nHonestly, I probably won't go back as there really wasn't anything to make this place a destination.  I hope your experience is a bit better than ours."
2,"An independent chain with a string of coffee shops in Edinburgh and Glasgow, Beanscene claim to offer a unique alternative to corporate coffee chains like Starbucks, Costa and Cafe Nero. \n\nThe problem is, their branches look just as bland with brown leather arm chairs and uncomfortable wooden tables and chairs. The coffee and food is around the same price point too and just as unremarkable. Admittedly, I've heard good things about the pizza and nachos from friends but the muffin and pannini I shared were both 70% stodge and 30% filling. As for the ambient music playing softly in the background -  It might relax other customers but it made me feel like I was in an MFI or Sofa Workshop advert!"
2,was debating between which buffet to go to with this Vegas trip and decided on bacchanal after many yelp reviews and pictures viewing. I don't know if I hyped myself up too much or waht but really a 2.5 star. i was not impressed at all. yes there was a lot of food items and yes there were a ton of stations but the food just didn' tlook that fresh. i expected more sushi and sashimi items for $60 a person. Nigiri didn NOT look fresh.\n\nSeafood bar wasn't that good either. The crab legs didn't taste that good. other items on the hot bars looked dry and kinda old. Dessert wasn't that great either. i've had better buffets for a lot cheaper.
2,"The food was good considering it is a buffet. Nice ambiance. The desserts weren't as good as the other buffets I've been to on the strip; kinda boring. For the $$$, definitely not worth it! For being a new buffet on the strip they really should've brought something new and different from the rest."
2,Poor service. It took over a minute for him to get to the register with no greeting.  The lone employee was on his phone and had to call them back because customers arrived.\n\nThe order was correct.  The dessert was good (hard for him to mess that up).\n\nThe bathroom was messy with no trash bag in the can.  The common area was average.
2,"The place has a really great look, but it was extremely smokey.  Both our eyes were stinging before our meals came, and we smelled like kitchen smoke for the rest of the night.  We ordered 2 old fashioneds, which bore only a slight resemblance to actual old fashioneds.  The foie gras was the best dish we tried.  Everyone raves about the lobster poutine - it was nothing spectacular.  You can get much better poutine elsewhere.    The octopus salad looked great, but was pretty bland and chewy.  The pork something bread pudding was flavorless mush.  You pay a lot here for average food in a very smokey room."
2,"Just visited the HOTEL soon to be renamed Delano...we actually stayed in their all new Delano room, the hotel room itself is well designed, but the customer experience was horrible, and deserved 0 star!\n\nThe check-in took 45 minute when there were only 3-4 parties in front of me, although they are going through with their renovation, this is no excuse for the long wait.  We had specifically booked for a suite with 2 beds, but they weren't able to give us a regular room, so we ended up with a room that was designed for handicapped visitors (restrooms with handle bars).\n\nUpon entering the room, there trash left over from the previous visitor (unfinished drinks left on the table), and then the rest room there were half-washed glass cups (cuts with foams and not yet rinsed)....obviously someone was rushing to clean the rooms and forgot everything.\n\nFollowing morning, we requested for housekeeping by pushing the housekeeping button, but NO-SHOW, no housekeeping, we had to call again only to get a disgruntled cleaning lady who was very unwilling to come in and clean. After cleaning the room, and leaving, they left their cleaning detergents in the room.\n\nOverall, a very very poor customer service/experience for a very expensive room."
2,"Wow, it was packed, I really don't see why this place is so popular!  Ohhh yea, football!\nI got the sampler platter, the nachos were ok, I'm glad I didn't just get the nachos!  The onion rings taste like onion rings, the fried cheese, like the onion rings, nothing to hoop and holler about.\nThe spicy garlic is really spicy....and I like spicy, almost too spicy for me, I wasn't expecting that.  \nIt was ok, but wayyyyyy over priced for what we got!  \n\nThey won't be seeing me there anymore!"
2,"I have been to a few yarn stores as I'm relatively new to the crochet world. But I was rather disappointed with this store. I had a funny smell, it was spare and not inspiring. I will not be returning and hope to find better stores in town to satisfy my yarn craving."
2,"Have to agree with Katie L.  Unimpressive.\n\nWater and bread was served immediately.  Nice, except the bread was mushy sliced stuff - not a nice crusty loaf one might expect from an Italian restaurant.  Then, we waited for at least 10 - 15 minutes for our server; again, not quite sure which of the two it was, only to realize it was the same one who greeted and served the couple next to us who had been seated after us.    \n\nOrdered the stuffed mushrooms; a little soggy and overly-loaded with tomatoes.  Entree: stuffed shells would have been much much better with 1/4 of the sauce in which it was swimming.  Overall, disappointing."
2,We came here looking for something different for lunch close to work. \n\nIt's a walk up and order then grab a table. The person taking orders was nice and fast. \n\nI ordered the clam and white wine sauce. This was a big mistake as clams seemed canned and sauce wasn't on point. The noodles weren't the right choice either as they seemed over done. \n\nFor Italian food this wouldn't be a recommendation from me in the area.
2,"Food was fair, atleast hot, hard to find at 1 a.m..the problem for me is the staff...have tried several times to get a feel for the place...keep getting the same snobby attitude...will go in a pinch, but not my first choice.."
2,"Just left Betty's Nosh, nice decor (2nd star).\nFirst off, horrible optics, 7 servers standing in the middle of restaurant talking, while our sever was working the bar seating and outdoor patrons. Food, overpriced and poorly prepared. Ordered Thai chicken mushrooms with peanut sauce, shredded chicken breast was as dry a possible, peanut sauce...terrible.\nBeef and blue mushrooms...same as above different ingredients, same result. Reuben sandwich...store bought shaved corned beef..dry, stale pretzel roll...dry...seeing a theme here...last straw, another customer paid my tab, and I paid theirs and the waitress paid the difference out of her tip...as a fix. Where is the manager???!!! Nice to look at...but way overpriced for this type of service and quality.\nNeedless to say, we won't be back...oh yeah, this was our first visit."
2,"Went here for lunch. There weren't that many people in here, maybe 5 tables.  it was super slow to get our food, we waited easily 25 minutes.  The burgers were good, but priced according to Scottsdale.  After the meal was complete, we noticed our check was wrong... the waitress had given our more expensive check by 5$ to some other patrons, who paid it without noticing and left.  She then just gave us their check, which seemed a little shady to me. Places that are slow when not busy irritate me, and not very good service on top of that is why it only gets 2 stars even though the food was great."
2,"I wanted to prove another yelper wrong but she was right when she said frozen store bought pizza was better. As soon as I took a bite of their pizza the words Red Baron came to mind. The sauce was nothing special, the cheese was the only redeeming quality along with the meaty mildly spicy wings. Now the crust... That was NOT pizza crust, it felt like thick bread somebody slapped tomato sauce and cheese on it. I usually don't have to judge pizzas this negatively on their crust, but I had to, it's comparable to little Caesar's $5 pizza."

2,"This dentist office is the king of the up-sell and unnecessary procedures.  Communications are not complete and thorough.  It seems from my experience with this office that everyone is incentivize to sell more procedures, products and service plans.  All I have gotten from the staff is you need to do this or that and we will get you on a recurring plan for the health of your teeth.  I need facts about dental health, not up sells to make the dentist who owns this practice more money.  Beware of this element of this specific dentist office.\n\nOwners comments are they can't find me in there database, but they can find me well enough to send me an invoice for additional services.  I paid all charges at the time my appointment was completed, and now I receive another charge via mail.  My comments stand, beware of this practice."
2,"I have been to this place a few times for both shopping and dining in the cafe. Here is what I like:\n\nDelicious food that is healthy and tasty \nNice selection of healthy foods \n\nHere is what I don't like:\nThe service - the people at the cafe in particular. They would rather inconvenience you, the customer, than to go out of their way to provide any type of service, Which leads me to the second thing that I dislike, which is their prices. I realize that the price point is a little higher for some of your items, and I would be fine with that if I felt I was appreciated as a customer, but since that's my first dislike, then this makes the prices much less palatable. \n\nI mean seriously."
2,"Fellow yelpers, I was mislead by the reviews of this place! I frequently browze yelp to find new places to eat and must respectfully disagree with most of the reviews.\n\nFirst off, it was so hot in this place; I don't think they had the air on. It also smelled like maybe their grease trap needed emptied-- not pleasant.\n\nFor a quick service setting, it was not quick at all. We waited 10 minutes to order on the counter, and then waited another 20 for it to be brought to our table. I had the tomato soup, which actually tasted pretty good but was still cold. I also had the California Turkey sandwich was a little too bready  for my taste, but otherwise okay.\n\nThe boyfriend had the marketplace turkey, which is served open-faced. He seemed to like his well enough.\n\nThis may have just been a bad visit, but I have no desire to come here again."
2,"My husband made me go there after having an average dinner there two years ago. \nAfter a fabulous dinner last night at Bradley Ogden, Raos was the most horrible meal I've had in a long time. The veal Parmesan was so tough and salty I could barely eat it. Needless to say, my husband doesn't get to pick restaurants any more. He's going to have to make it up to me tomorrow for our last dinner in Vegas this trip."
2,"This was a very bad experience for my kids and I to go to ; first of all , the service wasn't great, the food was terrible and I thought it was very overpriced. I ordered fajitas and they tasted very much like a \""chemical taste\"" . Not impressed and I won't be going back there."
2,"Not sure where Stan is from but where I'm from, a Deli is not a restaurant.... it is a deli. \n\n Minus 1 star for deceiving me into expecting a legit Deli to appear on Mill.\n\nminus 1 Star for not understanding what no cheese and no mayo means.\n\nThere are many places we have from where I'm from that has the gimmick of 3 pieces of bread.  They are called diners, not delis.  \n\nWith only 3 other tables needing service I also expected a more attentive server that saw my tea was empty or notice that we needed more napkins because mayo and cheese occupied the original ones. \n\nEven the thank you from the owner/manager was delayed, we were 100ft down the street when he hollered at us.  Hopefully they get it together, I do like independent spots on Mill, but I'm not so sure about a non-Deli Deli being the answer."
2,"First visit & I won't be back. HH food prices are overpriced in my opinion. $8 for 2 pieces of average bruschetta, no thank you ill goto Postino instead. Had a gift card they wouldn't accept on cocktails??? Who does that? It was a gift! Much better places to go & enjoy."
2,"I've been there twice.. once for lunch in the first week that they were open and the food was OK but not worth the price tag.  I figured I'd give them some time and give it another try.  We went for dinner tonight.  Again, the food was OK but not worth the price tag.  I asked if we could get a small bowl of noodles with just some plain Parmesan cheese for my 1 year old and the server pointed us to the 6 dollar spaghetti and meatballs. Children's meals were 6 bucks and didn't include a drink - a 4-6 ounce cup of chocolate milk was an additional 2.75 which seems like a huge rip off. \nI had to stop the bus boy twice from taking food that we weren't finished eating and then went to take my daughter to the bathroom, and he cleared off my water glass which I had JUST finally gotten refilled.  You'd think after the first time, he would have given us a bit more space/time but that was not the case. \nMy food and my husbands food pretty good but nothing worth the price tag. It's really a shame,  We've been to cork and I really, really wanted to like this place."
2,"What is with the guy working there? He is seriously pissed-off every-time I go in. Actually last time I was there I walked out because he was yelling at one of the workers and it made me want to cry. I wish she would have walked out too. The time before that he was rude, not just rude, but a complete jerk to the people in front of me, what an a-hole. \n\n2 stars because it is downstairs from my work, and it's cheap and if one of my co-workers goes to get a slice they always have my hawaiian pie."
2,"Land of the $20 bottle of Heineken. Yep, you read that right: TWENTY DOLLARS. If I didn't need to drink that crappy beer to muster the mental stamina to keep myself composed amongst all of the crappy music and creepy men, I wouldn't have paid that. I've decided that this is where I am going to spend a lot of time if/when I finally completely give up on having any faith in humanity and human decency."
2,"Food wasn't that great. I guess it's because I'm from SF, where we have the best and most authentic Vietnamese food. We came here for lunch while we were in Vegas and just wanted something outside of the casinos. I ordered the Pho Ga (chicken noodle soup) and it tasted really bland. We also had the Spring rolls which was just ok. Pho is always based on how good the soup is, and the soup here was not authentic at all. It tasted more like msg mixed with water and it tasted really fake. \n\nIt's cool that this place is so close to the strip (driving) and a good place to get some soup if you have a hangover, but as a meal? Neh...."
2,"Beautiful property but last time we stayed there they were oversold. We arrived @10pm to find out that the word \""reservation\"" did not mean they had a room for us.\nThey said they had overcommitted & we had to drive 20 mins & check into another hotel - our room would be available the next day. \nWhat a pain! My husband was there got a meeting being held @ the JW, so he had to get up extra early the next am to account for travel time back to the JW & I had to move our stuff back."
2,Meh! I wasn't impressed. It was just decent thai and nothing special. I wouldn't go there again. Is rather eat at Thai house nearby.
2,"We decided to try out Fago de Chao today for our Anniversary it was disappointing to say the least. I am also a Private Chef and they were gracious enough to let me tour the kitchen but the meat  was over done and dry. The salad bar was really good with lots of variety. One of the  servers was exceptionally nice he's the one that gave me the tour and brought us an Anniversary dessert that was very good. I would just expect that since the main excitement of the Resturant was all the meat that it should be cooked exceptionally well, juicy and moist.We visit a lot of restaurants for the cuisine and the atmosphere and this one unfortunately won't be on our list for a return visit at these prices especially."
2,"Really substandard quality in here.  Having eaten in many restaurants in Vegas, I felt I got cheated by coming here.  Service was friendly, but the food was not the star."
2,"Well, since this is my local cupcake shop...I was hoping that it would get more stars.  I love cupcakes and always try to find a shop that will impress me more than the last.\n\nPositive: Located in a great neighborhood and it's a great place to sit and have some coffee and a cupcake.  Staff was friendly.\n\nThe cupcakes: the price was average, but they were regular \""home baking\"" sized cupcakes...seems some shops they are just a tad bigger...so for the price, it really was nothing special.  I found they were a bit dryer than other places.  I was sadly disappointed...I'd say they were average homemade cupcakes...I wouldn't make a special trip here.  But then again, I am comparing them to many other cupcake stores I've visited, so if you haven't tried many others, you might find these great and the charm of the store impressive.  I've had better.\n\nWould still stop in due to the close proximity if I was meeting a friend for coffee, but not because of the cupcakes....sorry:("
2,"Service was HORRIBLE!  Over 2 hours to get food delivered to table. Their excuse?  They bring orders out \""family style\"" as (and whenever) sushi dude gets things done.  So, person with specific food choices has to twiddle thumbs while \""lucky\"" odd person gets their order delivered. \n\nAnd- adding insult to injury- food when delivered is only mediocre at best\n\nStay away"
2,"I should have read the reviews before choosing this place. Shame on me.\n\nI felt like we were at a day care facility that happened to serve awesome burgers. Crying babies, unruly toddlers, older children literally running down the aisles, inattentive parents and unbelievable amount of NOISE. Unfortunately no matter how tasty and reasonably priced their burgers are, we will never return to this locale. \n\nNot slamming the establishment, just letting others know."
2,"We asked about the house wine and were told it was good. No such luck.\nThe pizza was good, but the service was lacking."
2,"Not as good as I thought from reading reviews.  Oxtail soup had lots of yellow fat on the meat, means meat was cooked, frozen, then thawed out.  Loco moco was ok for first few bites but after that was hard to continue.  Just something about the taste that wasn't what I am used to.   Ice tea was nothing but sugar water, couldn't taste any tea flavor.  Won't return, sorry"
2,"I didn't know there were any car washes not using filtered water left in Phoenix, but apparently Full Circle's one of them. While even coin-op washes boast \""spot-free filtered water!\"", I had to break out the quick detailer spray and a microfiber as soon as I got home from Full Circle--water spots galore!\n\nThis was after the attendant had done my towel dry, mind you, and wiped down most of the water but left my mirrors soapy. And picked the remnants of the receipt out of my windshield cowl, because the other attendant helpfully left it tucked under the wiper blade when he sent me through.\n\nSure, for 4 bucks I didn't have to get sweaty in the humid summer air (well, at least not until I came home and had to clean up their mess)... but  I don't think it's unreasonable to think \""Exterior Wash\"" shouldn't be synonymous with \""Careless Wash.\"""
2,"I don't see the attraction. This place DEFINES \""living on past glory\""\n\nFor pizza, its not cheap.\n\nThe pizza doesn't taste all that good and is greasy at best.\n\nThe place has not been renovated since the 70's and it shows."
2,"If anyone says this is the best pizza they have had they are lying.  The pizza is a touch below average, and the prices are outrageous.  If you are charging almost five dollars for a slice of cheese pizza it should be very large and delicious, and it is neither.  I cannot imagine a full grown man or woman being full on one piece, and paying over ten bucks for two slices, not including a drink, is just crazy.  Please go somewhere else and avoid the mistake I made by eating here."
2,"This place is actually called (Seoul Korean Grill/BBQ)  Where do I begin...the meat was good quality and tasty, but was one of the smallest plates of meat I have ever seen in a Korean BBQ restaurant.  I have been to a lot of authentic Korean BBQ/Restaurants, but this was nowhere close.  When you leave a Korean restaurant, you are supposed to leave with a full stomach, I was still hungry.  Rice was a separate order...wtf is that shit.  One of the main reasons I am upset at this place is because they didn't have most of the appetizers or much of anything else available.  They had only a couple of beers to choose from (Japanese), even though the menu has about 7 imported beers.  I like Japanese beer, don't get me wrong, but come the fuck on, if you are a Korean BBQ restaurant...I expect to at least drink my native beer.  They should change their name, this is not a real Korean BBQ place.  I was wondering why nobody else was in the restaurant.  I believe this place is run by a bunch of kids, their parents would be so disappointed or at the very least Koreans, so embarrassing.  I will not be returning to this place.\n\nThe only thing I did like about the place other than the meat quality was the doenjang/bean paste."
2,"The place was packed on Sunday for lunch. Might be people going out from Sunday church. The green salad was dressed in lightly sweetened ginger sauce. The pan fried shrimp pocket were really good. I just wish they have a special sauce as dipping instead of just plain soy sauce. As entrees, we got the chicken and vegetables which came out cold, might have been that the chef forgot to put it first in the microwave. We returned it and the waiter said he will check with the chef. But what is there to check. So we told them to change it to grilled chicken instead. The manager (I guess) came to us and said the grilled chicken will take a while and said maybe because of the weather that's why it got cold. But the other entree Ma-la shrimp and chicken was steaming hot. Anyway, the grilled chicken came steaming hot and with barbeque sauce. All in all the food is at least 3 notches up from your normal chinese buffet on a scale of 1-10 (buffet=4). The food is priced reasonably for the quality. Service is just fair."
2,"There were certainly pros and cons to my experience here, but unfortunately the cons outweighed the pros.\n\n  I liked how friendly the staff was.  They took the time to remember my name and the scheduling was very easy.  They also took a very thorough look at my teeth and gums- everything from an oral cancer screening to measuring the softness of my teeth and gums in order to check for cavities.  They also didn't give me a hard time about not having a check up/cleaning for 5 years.\n\nHowever, they told me that I had 7 cavities and needed a very expensive gum treatment.  I know I hadn't been in for awhile, but that seemed a little over the top to me.  Thankfully I have dental insurance, but even with my insurance the cost of all of that was going to be pretty outrageous.  I got a second opinion from another dentist before spending all that money, and learned that none of it was necessary.  I feel like they look for problems that aren't there in order to make extra money.\n\nLike I said, my experience wasn't entirely negative but I would suggest being wary of any excessive or expensive procedures."
2,"Just stayed there for a wedding...room was ok, but the toilet was very noisy...when I opened the tank to see if I could make it quieter it looks like the fill valve hadn't been changed in 10 years.\nThey have an \""Eco\"" thing where you can decline having your sheets changed and in exchange you get a $5 voucher to use at the food and beverage sites at the hotel...warning...you can't use it on alcohol but they don't tell you that...I learned that when the bartender told me.  Rather than telling me that, he should have said \""I am not supposed to take this, but I will for you\"" then take the $5 out of his tip jar...I would have tipped him the $5 back for good customer service.  Instead he left a bad taste in my mouth and now I am Yelping about it.\nOne more thing about the $5 incentive...I didn't realize that meant that housekeeping would not visit the room at all and we were left without new coffee cups and coffee and \""glasses\"" (which are cheap cheap cheap plastic cups).  I think for the price of the room and their \""Eco\"" programs, they would be able to put a few glass glasses in the room.\nGood location and an easy walk to other restaurants, bars , hotels and sites.\nParking was kinda pricey but not unreasonable for  downtown in a major city."
2,"This morning wanted something different for breakfast. Decided on vietnamese food .          \n               Ordered the spring rolls and the BBQ pork meat balls for apps. Spring rolls they were alright nothing special. Pork meatballs very tasty just two skewers and a garden load of veges and herbs. It was like I ordered a BBQ meatball salad. They serve it with rice paper wraps on the side that r hard( WTF ) maybe I missed something ? Give me some water so I can soften it up myself,  I also ordered the BBQ pork bowl or I thought I did. I got the same set up as the BBQ meatball , shit load of lettuce and herbs and some BBQ pork and what looked and tasted like 2 slider patties? The meats are very tasty but the meat portions r small. They serve alot of lettuce and herbs, I mean alot of it  \n            The food taste good, it's jus that the meat to lettuce ratio has to change , if I were rabbit I would b happy. Next time maybe try the pho at least I don't think it comes w lettuce,  Yeah I luv meat !!"
2,"Ordered a 12\"" tuna sub.  The sandwich maker went out of her way to make sure that I didn't get any extra tuna, going so far as to scrape any tuna clinging on the outside of the scoop onto the storage bin side. 12\"" tuna sub with meal deal= $13.00.  Most expensive I have ever bought.  Never again at this location."
2,"Beds were comfy, but no coffee pot in room. I forgot my pillow in the room and the jack ass at the counter wouldn't send anyone up to get it for me. I'm sorry, but, that's bad customer service. And the Buffet was closed for renovation and nobody thought to tell us when making reservation!! We would have went to another tell if we would of know that. Never staying here again!  The only reason they are getting 2 stars is because of the beds, otherwise it would have been 1."
2,"Just gone done with a birthday dinner here for my cousin. I will say what we ordered (Margherita pizza) was very good, but others at our table were disappointed with what they ordered. The mozzarella was some of the best I've ever had.\n\nMy issue is with the service. Dinner was at 7. Our waitress, Victoria, failed to clear plates from the table, had to make it a point that they don't offer free birthday desserts because \""they get 2 to 4 birthdays a night.\"" That's fine, but I'm sure every birthday table is dropping $200 or more on wine & food and you can't give out a small free birthday dessert?\n\nThe worst part of the night was waiting FORTY-FIVE minutes for her to tally 5 separate checks for 14 people. What should have been an enjoyable 1.5 half hour dinner turned into a 2.5 hour nightmare with some of the worst service I've ever received. Even the owner was sitting at the bar with a glass of wine on his laptop and ignoring the 3 birthday tables he had.\n\nIn fact, getting the check took so long that by the time we left we were hungry again, so we stopped off at Burrito Express & got great service!"
2,"I used to love coming there to get my burrito fix as their food is way better and fresher than of the \""Bertos\"" but lately it's gone down hill in way of service and food. Last time the food was way over salted but I let it slide. Today my burrito was just sloppily rolled with air pockets all throughout and I couldn't even see any chicken till I almost finished it. I only ever order the pollo asado burrito so I can't speak for other dishes on the menu. Whoever runs this place needs to be fired and have all new people come in. It's also not as clean as it used to be. I don't care if service isn't that friendly, I just want my food and my food done right but if you're somebody who cares about great service then this is not the place for you!"
2,Been to this place many times last year. The only problem with this place is very very over price for what you get. Spend your time elsewhere and save yourself tons of $$$. The food and service is okay nothing to write about.
2,"This is s great representation of a bank that has little care for the customer experience.  I tried out this bank thinking I would move from the big four.  It was not a score.  I was unable to reach phone customer service after holding for a hour.  I was unable to access my savings account at the arm.  Check prices were outrageous.  No personal bankers at this location when I was there to close my accounts.  They didn't even ask me why I was closing my accounts.   Terrible bank, subpar company."
2,"Pros: \n\n1. Clean\n 2. Fast service \n3. Prices ($25 for white tips with gel polish) \n\nCons: \n1. Did not have me wash my hands \n2. Did not clean under my nails \n3. Did not place the tips correctly. (I did not want to cut down my regular nails. There is a gap between my nails and the tips which shouldn't be there) \n4. There were bubbles in my nails.   \n5. I asked him to round my nails and he thinned them on the sides which is not the same thing.  \n\nOverall, the service was OK. The nails look neat at first glance so I won't complain too much. Plus I still left a tip just because I always do. I may return again."
2,"I wonder what happened here...I guess when the name changes then all else goes 180\n\nSee, I remembered when this place was called Rah and things were still \""right\"" as in everybody said \""excuse me\"" if they accidentally bump to you (not intentional like what most douchebags think is the way to pick up women...geez, I thought we were in a club not the gorilla chamber at the zoo) and the smell of rotten banana daiquiri didn't go under your nose from 4 feet across of where he's standing & yelling out to dance with him\n\nDrink plenty of vodka, gin, rum, whatever to make sure you forget that you danced with Rico \""Suave\"" who had 2 left feet & a sport jacket doused with aramis cologne"
2,"I have to say, as a local here in Las Vegas, I hate crappy service.  Went with a couple of out of town friends for a total of four people.  Our waiter was just plain in a funk.  Service was slow, food arrived before we could finish the salad (Is it pre-cooked?) No plates provided until we flagged someone down. Never refilled beverages without us asking.  When he cleared the table, he reached into the center of the table and began stacking all the used plates right in our faces. No finesse at all. everything as far as service is in slow motion, and you get ignored a lot.  The only thing I must admit they do with great expediency is drop the check on the table.  Oh and by the way, not once did  any staff member say thank you, while we all thanked them every time they brought us something.  Sorry just poor service, but the food was not too bad."
2,the property is undergoing construction.   You may want to select another location until they are done.   then you should let a few months pass and check the reviews again.
2,I was going to write a lengthy detailed description but decided it is not worth my time. My wife and I have given this particular Outback 3 more chances in the last 7 months. NEVER AGAIN!
2,"I asked for a cheeseburger with bacon combo not being familair with the menu. The overweight guy behind the register was quick to correct me \""oh you mean the paradise bacon cheseburger\"". ...he seemed offended. Sounds good I said, with a side of ranch too for the fries. He took my money as if he was doing me a favor by ringing me up. \n\n...once I got my food, the burger was OK, better than fast food, but not as good as I was hoping from the pictures & reviews. The fries were pretty good, but the 'ranch' was not ranch. I went to the cooler thinking the d-bag at the register mixed it up. I reached for another cup explaining what I had was some sort of potato salad. He looked offended again claiming \""oh no, that's ranch! I made it myself this morning\"" ...bottom line; the paradise bacon cheseburger is better than carls jr (but SMALL), they have no idea what ranch is, their sodas are over-priced cans because they can't afford a fountain machine, & their customer service sucks. \n\nF this place & the land-blimp who owns it.\n\n-Mark"
2,"Fast? Check. Cheap? Check. Relaxing? Uhhh.. not even close. The entire 55 minutes of my manicure I had more then one person trying to upsell me on something.\nGel nails, white tips, parafin dip, pedicure - you name it.. \nI just wanted a quick manicure on my lunch hour so my cuticles were looking healthy.  \nMy nail tech was sweet as can be, the others and the atmosphere is a whole other story. They state they accept credit cards, however there are signs hanging all over stating if you pay with a credit card, the cost is higher.  \nIf you are able to stick to your guns, and can tune out yelling - for $9.99 you can get a decent looking manicure.  Otherwise, I would look elsewhere."
2,"I hate to be mean, but my pizza was over cooked and there was nothing on it, then my husbands meatball sandwich was the size of a kids meal. We were in shock at how small it was.. :(... I heard the salads are great tho-guess I should've had that..."
2,"Took 45 minutes to get our food. The kids ordered Mac and Cheese, wife ordered salmon and I ordered the spicy tuna roll. Why the delay? No explanation, just an apology and they comped the Mac and Cheese. Unfortunately we won't be back. Service here in the past has been brutal... Too bad."
2,"This Zombie of a Steakhouse was not on our list of places to dine at in Vegas at all but we ended up at that end of the strip and starving so we grabbed a table at the first place we found that wasn't full, which should have been a warning in itself.\n\nZero energy, zero interesting, just a complete cookie cutter streakhouse, and way overpriced for the level it delivers.\n\nOur appy was an antipasto platter, which was all clearly storebought out of a bottle, bland hummus, bland baba, everything in desperate need of salt, a tiny amount of grocery store pita...\n\nMy wife's entree was the burger, it was good, but again really in need of salt.\n\nMy lobster linguini was not good, no salt, beautiful pieces of lobster totally overcooked, pasta completely overcooked as well. Chewy lobster?\n\nService was utterly bland as well, the wait staff appeared to be sleepwalking as well.\n\nOh well, I guess that's what you get for picking blind."
2,"As far as national fast food chains go - Wendy's is one of the better ones. I appreciate that you can get a salad instead of fries here. Their burgers usualy seem fresher and better tasting too. However, this location appears to be one of the worst run Wendy's I've ever been to. My salad not cold, was wilted, and had lots of brown bits. Service was far from enthusiastic."
2,"The two stars are strictly for the view. Great view of the three rivers and downtown. The decor is okay. The food is overpriced. The bread reminds me of white Wonderbread with Italian crust. The salad was ok. The dressing was good. The olives were canned olives and the tomato was old. The soup was so-so. The veal piccata was ok...a little bland. The chicken parmesan tasted like chicken and ketchup   Dessert was pretty bad. Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was really runny and not even caramelized on top. The $10 chocolate cake was cold and actually tasted like a refrigerator. Service was fair at best. I had to constantly ask for refills on my iced tea.  Oh, did I mention a great view of the city?  We won't be going back here. We'll need to check out a different Mt Washington restaurant next time."
2,"After our recent stay at the Flamingo, I have to delete a few stars due to the new Drais outdoor nightclub.  We stay for extended periods during our Vegas trips, so we do TRY to sleep.  The constant base beats til 5 a.m. proved to be a little much.  As Diamond members we are given rooms with beautiful views.  But the trade off for the views is too irritating!  So if we chose the Flamingo again we will now have to look at the backside of the Flamingo instead of the views we have spent the money to be comped.  We still love the people and the rooms, but will be moving on to another property!  Not great planning there Cromwell!"
2,"Being the only Korean BBQ place we saw in Chinatown, this was it.  It ended up being a comedy of errors all night.\n\nI think the fun part of eating Korean BBQ is cooking the meat.  Otherwise i would just go to a regular restaurant and have them cook everything in the kitchen.  Well, I ordered the Dak Bugolgi and they actually said it would taste better if they cooked it in the kitchen and then brought it out.\n\nThen we ordered the Grandmother's Special.  They brought the wrong order and started grilling the wrong meat.  They ended up removing the meat from the grill when they realized their mistake.  \n\nOnce they brought the right food, every time anyone tried to cook the meat, someone came right over and took the tongs away and cooked the meat.  (No fun what-so-ever)\n\nLastly, right before we left, there was some sort of sewer-drain overflow that started overflowing in the kitchen and it smelled like garbage.  Not a good smell when you just finished eating.  We left quickly."
2,"My friends went here for date night, and brought me an order to-go.  He really enjoyed his steak.  She said the fried pickles were not crispy and were made with poor quality pickles, the ribs were pretty good, the pulled pork was tender but dry, the garlic mashed potatoes were okay, and the creamed corn was delicious.  She said overall it was mediocre and she won't go back. \n\nMy order was the beef brisket sandwich with macaroni and cheese.  It did not look like the one in the picture on their website (on a different type/shape of bun), and did not come with au jus to dip it in.  The meat was tender but very bland and dry.  The macaroni and cheese was so spicy that I could not eat more than one bite, all I tasted was jalape\u00f1o.  The menu did not mention that it would be spicy.  It was very disappointing.  I would not recommend this place at all."
2,I believe the name has changed to Cous Cous.  I think they have new owners & chefs.  the lamb burger spices have changed for the lesser .  doubt I will return.  I don't like the last 2 new cashiers I've delt with.
2,"Make sure you get that Palms Club card to save some payola here. The only reason I would recommend dining here would be for the club prices.\n\nThe food was ordinary at best. What follows is my late night breakfast experience. Though the strips of bacon were on the smallish side, they were prepared with a good blend of tenderness/crunchiness, with an average taste. i ordered my eggs scrambled soft, and they were prepared perfectly. I ordered wheat toast; the bread thickness was in-between the norm and Texas toast. The last item, the home fries, were unbearable. In my travels home fries are typically not fried potato bits, as these were. and as such, the taste was more grease than potato."
2,"The only thing this Jamba Juice has going for it is its location. \n\nAs a UNLV student and a lover of Jamba Juice I was super excited to find out there was a Jamba on campus.  But to my great disappointment it is terrible.\n\nThe quality of the product is mediocre. \n\nThe service is horrendous. I always seem to be helped (or lack there of) by the same guy and I truly do not understand what his problem is. If he is not being blatantly rude, he is occupying his time ignoring the myself and other customers. The other workers there seem to be completely miserable and get rather offended if you ask them a question. \n\nThe location is overall confusing. I understand that they do not have much room to work with, however, it NEVER fails that when I go in there most of the customers have a confused look on their face and no one working will take the time to direct them to where the line starts and where they should wait to get their drink."
2,"VIBE \nThe decor at Le Cartet is awesome. Cool castor-esque light bulbs hang down from the ceilings. Cool cut outs of maps are on the wall and big pots of poinsettas are in the back. I can see it's a buzzy type of place for brunch/lunch. I came for lunch but where Le Cartet really misses out is on its service. \n\nI was not greeted. I was not asked normal things like: would you like something to drink? I had to ask for the specials. \n\nI ATE \nI had the salmon sandwich. It was a decent sandwich but I assumed I'd have slices of salmon as opposed to it being a creamy mishmash of a tuna melt. It was solid food but way overpriced with a measley green salad for $15. \n\nOBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK \nLe meh. That said, I would come back if I'm directly in the area for ambiance or to buy something in the market. Otherwise, it's a bit on the edge of Old Montreal and out of the way for something that is ho-hum."
2,"Crustaceans are tricky buggers and with them, you have limited courses of action. The most optimal choice would be to carry around a small kit of instruments carefully rolled up in a jewelry case with which to extract the meat skillfully and gracefully. \n\nIf you are not an international spy, however, you end up doing what most of us do, which is look at the animal with a bit of confusion, poke it with a fork, fail to extract meat with fork, and finally revert to caveman status, ripping the damn thing apart. \n\nOnce you finally gain entry, you realize that there is very little meat in the legs and claws, the body holds some type of ill-colored jelly-like substance which you assume are organs and you decide not to take your chances with, and all for $25. To top it off, waitstaff is going to be picking crab shell out of the woodwork for weeks that has inadvertently been jammed in there like ninja throwing stars during your caveman frenzy. \n\nHole In The Wall Crab Shack, I will be back. However, not to try this dish. I understand that crabs are expensive, though I don't understand why for the amount of work involved with what I consider a low-yield payoff. I understand that for what they are, you probably do them best (though the garlic crabs I got were more salty than expected). My friend's shrimp looked very appetizing, and I did regret my purchase. Hopefully my next visit will be regret-free."
2,This is a very expensive steakhouse in Las Vegas that runs out of STEAK (as well as 4-5 other important menu items) & doesn't even apologize sincerely.  It was only 8pm and not even particularly busy. Epic Fail. There are plenty of great steakhouses in Las Vegas. Good luck!
2,"Pretty good selection and decent food...only problem is the people running this place are very cheap and try to limit your selection of the quality stuff at every turn. Then they charge you extra if you do not finish your plate clean of sushi rolls you did not like. The F with that. Not to mention they have an extreme attitude and have high expectations on tip. Go somewhere else, put places like these out of business."
2,"Looking at all the reviews, maybe I went on an off night, but I've had better steaks at home on my own grill from the local market.  Went with a group of 9 and ordered the \""surf and turf\"" consisting of the ribeye and a seafood mashed potato combo.\n\nThe good - Mashed potatoes were excellent, generous lump seafood, very tasty.  Side dishes also were excellent.\n\nThe disappointing - The ribeye.  Ordered it medium rare, as did my friend next to me.  Both of our steaks were probably cooked closer to medium, neither was juicy or tender, there seemed to be no marbled fat content at all, and the texture was almost grainy.\n\nI'll eat everything from In N Out to more foodie type establishments, always with a smile on my face, but this experience was a bit of a shock to me.  I've had ribeyes for 1/3 the price but infinitely better.  \n\nWeird.  But I think I'd rather try somewhere else as I wouldn't want a repeat experience at that price point."
2,"I wanted to like this place and unfortunately, it just isn't good.  We've passed by several times and always saw an empty parking lot.  After tasting the food, it's pretty obvious why.  They either lost the passion for good BBQ and flavor or it was never that good.  There are pictures of Guy Fieri all over which after tasting the food makes us think they paid for that advertisement.  The chicken is dry with no seasoning, the sauce is just sauce, nothing special and somewhat similar to the stuff you buy in the market.  My homemade BBQ sauce is way better actually.  The rest of the meat such as the ribs was okay, not terrific, the brisket was fatty and unpleasant and the pork had a strange after-taste.  The coleslaw was poorly seasoned, the BBQ beans lacked flavor (husband said Bush's in a can is better) and the potato salad had no flavor.  We did also try the pickles and while they are breaded evenly, the breading texture is like thick paper.  They tasted okay although dipping them in their ranch sauce made the pickles much better.  The atmosphere is very Five and Diner-ish.  Just too bad to have a cute little BBQ restaurant nearby that isn't worth visiting."
2,"What I want to know is who the hell puts sweet relish on a burger? Especially a burger that already has dill pickles.. I mean I love pickles as much as the next asshole, but I fn HATE sweet relish, so it pretty much ruined the whole thing. \n\nAside from that, my curly fries were perfect, and they have Cherry Coke.. so here, have 2 stars."
2,"Quite possibly the worst Krispy Kreme experience ever! We came here around 9:45 to get two boxes to take home on the evening of Black Friday. The lady that helped us was incredibly rude. No matter the circumstance, and I don't even know if she worked an all day/night shift, she should have been friendly. That aside, I notice some man mopping the floors, water going *wooosh* inside where the donuts are just laying there on the machine. I could not believe my eyes!! The labels did not match the donuts on display and when we asked her to clarify, she gave us a long speech about how they distribute donuts to the gas stations and blah blah blah. I was honestly ready to walk out but we were lucky enough to just pick out the donuts on display that were at least covered by a glass door. I will not come back here... ever"
2,"What happened to this place?  I went a few years ago and remember enjoying it.  Now, everything looks run down.  Mildew, stains, steam room not working correctly and outdated.  So very disappointed.  I did not have any services done, this is just for using the facilities."
2,"oh 5th and wine, i like your name, but it felt more like 5th and whine....the service was terrible.  very very slow...after dropping off the tab we tried to get the waiter's attention for 30min, to no avail, so ended up having to pay cash so we could leave.  the art on the walls was cool though.  and my grilled cheese sandwich was good, but the dressing on my salad tasted like dish water, which was awkward.  i wouldn't go back, there are so many restaurants in that area to choose from, i recommend choosing another one."
2,Barf. I can usually eat anything. The pad thai was the first dish in 10 years I couldn't eat v   The wifes cashew chicken was a 4/10. Keep driving to Naga if you want Thai.
2,"\""Would you like some stamps or ice with that?\""\n\nWith my Snickers bar? No thanks, they don't go well together. How about this, Circle K...\""If I wanted stamps or ice I WOULD HAVE ASKED FOR THEM!\""\n\nUgh, I can't stand this Circle K. Always trying to up sell me on shit I don't need. It ain't that clean either. It's jam packed with the many farm and construction workers in the area so it is convenient for them. The location earns them a second star since there isn't much in the area. Also, Circle K fixed their overcharging for 5 Hour Energy drinks by offering a 2 for $5(reg) and 2 for $6 (extra strength) special. I don't know, probably still too much for them, but they help me get through the day."
2,"I'm not a fan of this store. There was an outfit I was completely in love with for my newborn but for a onesie and pants it was 30 dollars. I'm not willing to spend that one an outfit my daughter will outgrow in a month. I went to Ross and found the exact same outfit for 7.99. Same with the toys, I paid 15.00 for a toy I later found at walmart for 5. I understand they have to make money  but wow the mark up is outrageous. The crib set selection is very very small. I was told to shop online which I'm not a fan of. Seeing as this store is based around babies you would think the crib set collection would be a little better."
2,"Two stars because of the view. the food wasn't amazing. I think this would be better identified as a drinking spot. In fact it probably is a bar turned breakfast in the morning. Huge menu options, but we were on the hunt for breakfast so we didn't go far from the first page. I'd go back to sip cocktails on the patio and watch the fountain, but not for eats."
2,"I must be at a different place than I went 2 years ago.  I remember a fun atmosphere and good food at a decent price.  Tonight I had a 15$ juicy burger which was anything but.  Dry and flavorless is a better description.  My wife had the pulled pork and her exact description was \""meh\"".  The place is dirty and not as lively as it was.  The wait staff was friendly and attentive, so I give this two stars and not just one.  If you are about to pull into the parking lot, you would be much more satisfied walking over to Jac's or driving a little farther to Gates and Brovi for the same price."
2,"If you don't know anything about Dominican food (like me) check the menu ahead of time.  Five of us went to Nanos.  Four of us ordered Mofongo.  One of us was served Mofongo.  The trouble is there are multiple items on the menu with the same name and our server didn't make sure she knew what we were ordering. They did bring a plate of plain Mofongo to make up for it.  The final nail in the coffin was having our checks jumbled up, drinks on the wrong tickets, etc.\n\nWe thought \""oh the folks that own sabor and three amigos are opening a new place, of course it will be excellent\"".  Unfortunately not."
2,"The place was pretty busy when my husband and I visited one night. \nThe decor was ok but very kitschy.\nMy husband and I split the pear salad although the pears were the ones out of a can. \nThe special that night was beef cheeks which if you are familiar and like them, they can be amazing. But I could barely find them on the plate because they were drowned in a heavy overpowering sauce.\nMy husband had the lasagna which was decent and I honestly had more of that then my entree.\nFor what we had, it was totally overpriced. I could imagine Olive Garden would be just as good."
2,"I have been to many a deli my friend and this is not a very good deli. The kosher style corned beef they attempted was fatty, some of it was chewy and parts of it had been exposed to the air too long and gotten a bit hard. \n\nI also suggest more training on the deli equipment before someone is in need of stitches from the slicing wheel. The girl making my sandwich was having a hard time as a result of the previously mentioned hard portion and nearly pushed her finger into the wheel before deciding to shut it off while she fussed over the meat. \n\nI like to watch someone fussing over meat as much as the next guy but no one should lose a finger.\n\nThe potato salad was very bland.\n\nRather than leaving me with a fond memory of deli's I have been to in NYC, Boston, Cleveland, etc it left me wishing I had skipped it and wanting the real deal even more."
2,I travel for business for 11years. I had my share of airports. CLT needs improvements in the drop off and pick up areas. Need to expand the roads.
2,"I stopped in on Thursday night to give it a try, as the lack of BBQ in the Kierland/North Scottsdale area made this a potential spot in my regular listing of restaurants when I don't want to try something new.  As at any BBQ joint, the real test is the pulled pork and the brisket, so I got a combo plate with ranch beans and sweet potato fries as the sides.  The beans were nothing very significant one way or the other, and you get a huge order of the fries that needed seasoning.  The brisket did have a smoke ring, but no bark and i was not able to taste the smoke hardly at all: it was closer to pot roast than what I think of as good brisket.  The pulled pork was pretty good: it had been steeping in its own juices for quite some time, and they unfortunately serve it with the sauce already applied: you should ask for it on the side.  The real savior was the application of Tabasco: it seemed like the sauce had been designed with Tabasco included and then they deleted it from the recipe in fear of turning a potential customer away with too much flavor: with it included the pulled pork by itself goes to 3 and a half stars.  Whole place was fairly empty when I was there, but it was 8:30 on a Thursday...if you are really hankering for good Q, brave the location and go to Bobby Q's at I 17 and Dunlap"
2,"I'm very disappointed of Gallo Blanco service. The worst ever!!! he took a while to greet our table. Finally we ordered some drinks but they were out of Paloma margarita, dos x and negro modelo? crazy but we said ok not big deal, we ordered an appetizer while deciding for the rest. Somebody else dropped our appetizer and we didn;t see our server for a least 25 minutes. We ordered 4 tacos and it took 45 minutes to be served. I asked the server why was taking so long? He said \"" Well you should had ordered right of way\"" I was like WHAT??? Is he serious!!! giving me attitude when he was gone from our table and we didn't have anybody to order more drinks or food??? Extremely awful :( Once he brought the tacos which there were very cold? I told him \"" Please bring the Cajetas (the best dessert ever) and the Check\"" Well while we were still eating our cold tacos... he just brought the check and not dessert? I asked and he said you told me to bring the check... at that point I was so angry that I just paid and left!!! So sad that Gallo Blanco hired servers like that... He was sincerely worst than a fast food order taker from wendy!!!  I think he was and some kind of medication?  He looked very sleepy  and he was wearing a white belt that didn't match with anything!  Sorry Gallo Blanco!"
2,"This place used to be good, but has really gone downhill. The last time we went there, we had to send back three things because they were wrong or just plain bad. Too bad because this used to be the closest thing to Houston's in Charlotte."
2,"Calabria's looks like a really beautiful restaurant from the outside. The landscaping is always kept up with and the building is attracting to most of us who drive by it often. Although, when you go inside, it is outdated and stuck in the 90s. I went to a bridal shower here, which was elegant and beautiful compared to the regular restaurant area. The party room served breakfast foods later on in the day, which seemed odd to me for a fancy party room. I would recommend this place for a party because it is separate from the restaurant itself, but I am not impressed with the restaurant as a whole. The service was good, the food is alright but the ambiance is just not there."
2,"1.3/5 stars - Almost so bad I can't eat it. The hand tossed pizza is about 25% edge, 50% air bubble and 25% soggy mess. Sauce tastes like catsup and the toppings always taste like they are frost bitten. The thin crust Philly cheesesteak pizza is surprisingly good, but it only comes around once in a while."
2,"When dining at the Bellagio, I'm aiming for a 4 or 5 star experience.  This was way below expectations! The service was extremely spotty.  \nWe had a large party, and I do understand if certain mistakes are made during busy hours.  However, they weren't super crowded.  Took a while for everything to come out.  What I really disliked the most was the waiter dropping off everything at certain spots of the table.  If you're a fancy sushi restaurant, wouldn't you at least know or remember who ordered which food and where it went? Also, there was clearly timing issues, and dishes came out one or two at a time.  For a large party, some people had to watch others eat.  It just amazed me how they dropped off the food, and since we were a large party, it took a while to determine who had ordered it.... And the waiter was pretty clueless also! The food itself was pricy, yet it was decent. The edamame was good, as it was well seasoned.  Besides that, definitely not worth it.  I would only go here again if I was forced to... If not, definitely visit other sushi places on the strip!!"
2,"Scheduled a 8am appt on a Sunday so I could get in early and get on with my day. Except for the receptionist, the staff slowly showed up between 8:10 and 8:15. I expect a medical staff to be a little more professional."
2,"I always feel kind of bad giving a one or two star review. I did like Sushi Factory's sushi, but there was something about the place that I can't exactly put my finger on that just will not let me give it over a two star rating. Okay, let's go with 2.5. \n\nWhen I arrived I was greeted by a very friendly hostess and seated quickly. Can I comment on the decor? I don't know, just looked a little ram-shackle to me. Ok ok... I'm not trying to be nit-picky, after all I do eat at plenty \""dumpy\"" kind of joints because their food is AWESOME. But somehow dumpy + place that is serving me raw fish = me weirded out a bit.\n\nI did the AYCE with my date. He was all hype about liking sushi though, he wouldn't even touch the sashimi I ordered, but instead insisted on all the fried little concoctions. One of our rolls completely fell apart when we tried eating it. Date didn't seem to care, but I was a little peeved.\n\nThank goodness they brought me out sake to begin with. I think this soothed the bad experience. \n\nDon't get me wrong, it's a decent little place, I just don't think I'll be going back considering there are much better places in the valley to get AYCE sushi."
2,First off this is the second time coming here.. Disappointed by the chaos and disorganization that caused a long wait after going to the place to pick up the pizza 30 mins after I called and ordered. It took another 15 mins before finally getting my pizza. This happened both times i went there. Really?!? It should not be like this. This will be the last time I come here. The pizza was good but if it takes all this to get a pizza.
2,Expensive and the food wasn't very good at all and there was no one in the restaurant and they still tried to put us at a bad table! Vodka pour was pathetic and the portions sizes were very small.  No way will this stay in business longer than a year.
2,"On my second visit to Char, we are dropping 2 stars off.  From the reviews I see that them cooking the hell out of beef seems to be standard. For the second time my burger was overcooked - not slightly this time, but way overcooked.  If you are unable by law or unwilling to cook a burger to medium, just fess up and I'll order chicken.  My order of a brisket burger ($12), which I asked for medium, came out as well and dry.  Dry, tasteless.  The onions were undercooked.  The tater tots as a side were fine. \n\nService was again excellent and we sat out on the patio which had a nice breeze and made for easy conversation.  But the service and amenities don't make up for the apparent consistently overcooking of beef.  Pass."
2,"This hotel was actually fairly nice for being so cheap. The rooms were clean and they have a free continental breakfast. \nI would have given this place 4 stars but their free wifi was broken and they've charged my credit cars 4 times now for this room. I understand that mix ups happen when charging hotel rooms, so I placed a call to the front desk to clear this up. The front desk clerk basically went psycho on phone screaming at me he can't help me. Didn't offer to take down my phone number and have me called back, just went straight to screaming as soon as I explained my situation. So now I'm dealing with their corporate office and my bank. Super 8 is a franchise, so there's not much their corporate offices can do to help even though they can view the transaction history and that I've been charged 4 times for the same room. What a headache! I would have saved myself a bunch of stress by staying at the Hilton Garden Inn for $25 more"
2,"The food is par to sub-par in quality. It was sloppy and rushed and in no way memorable. We were excited to have a nicer local restaurant so close by, but this was so blah-I don't know I would be back. \nHowever, the banana pudding was pretty good-I'd try that again but nothing else to write home about."
2,"Stopped by for lunch. It is a small pub. Didn't feel very clean & the chairs had rips in them, the server was working her ass off, she had a huge table she was working on plus us and a few others tables. The wait could have been better. I ordered a coke, it was flat. I ordered the British Burger which I have to say was delicious. Very flavorful & filling. My friend got the pulled pork sliders and she loved them as well. In closing, food is good, service could be better & the dining room could use a little sprucing up."
2,"Meh. Food was cooked well, ingredients were fresh, but everything was bland, and the proportions in the food were off on everybody's plate (e.g. way too many mushrooms when compared to the meat or eggs). Service was blah; there weren't many customers, yet we waited, and waited, and waited, for everything. \n\nBathrooms were pretty disgusting, not how I prefer to either begin or end a meal. \n\nWe probably won't be returning anytime soon."
2,"On a trip to Vegas a few months ago  we decided to give the stratosphere a try for our last night in town. Paid les than 100.00 for the oasis suite on Sunday night. We were looking forward to dinning at the Top of the world restaurant mainly for the view. Getting to the restaurant was somewhat of a challenge from the time we entered the elevator loading area on the main floor to the restaurant.  Had to ask for directions a couple a times. Once seated we began with their very taste bread basket and wine.   My wife ordered the ribeye and was fairly satisfied with it, but not a memorable steak. ( I prefer a fire charred steak)  We shared a huge twice baked potato (very good) and field greens salad. I ordered the lobster bisque (not bad, I've eaten better) and the prawns, scallops and lobster plate. The roasted salad and the scallops were very good, that's where it stopped. The lobster and the shrimp had a little bit of foul fishy taste. I could not identify it at the time but the other day I was eating crab legs and took a bite of the shoulder meat, there's that the taste I remember. We will not be back for the food, but if we book a room we may have a drink at the bar for the view.(fantastic view)  There are much  better restaurants in town for the same prices. I give the view 5 stars."
2,"OVER FRIKKIN RATED.\n\nSo we had to wait in line for over an hour (cuz we had our BFs with us) while we watched countless hootchie mamas stroll right to the front of the line to get in. My girls and I could've easily ditched the BFs and get in while THEY waited in that horrendous line... LOL... but of course we didn't.\n\nOn top of that, when we got in line they said it was going to be a $20 cover charge, so we say \""OK, not bad\"" and stay. But when we finally get to the booth, they drop a bomb on us and tell us its $40.... EACH. WTF? And for some stupid reason we actually paid that shit.... I think it was because we had waited in line all that damn time and we didn't want it to be for nothing. But a big FUCK YOU goes out to you Pure Night Club for lying and jacking up the prices at the last minute.\n\nRidiculously steep prices on drinks, even a bottled water would set you back almost $10. Uhh, no thanks. \n\nHighlight of the night was that we saw Dave Chappelle and Chris Rock while we were in line. *see pics*"
2,"I hate when you buy a groupon and then to actually get what you want they up charge you for everything once you get there. Total turn off and Such was the case at canyon falls. I had a groupon for a massage and it completely fell short. The building itself is nice and the massage area was bigger than I expected. But a soon as the massage therapist came to get  me and said oh you have the groupon massage, I knew it was going to be bad and it was. It wasn't even the full 60 min it was supposed to be and she barely used any pressure. I basically left an oily mess still wanting an actual massage. Very disappointing and I definitely will not be returning."
2,"TAO Beach is nothing special for Vegas. The area is very small and the day beds are crowed but they are not very expensive in the gran scheme of things. Murky water (I get it, but come on). \n\nTAO Beach is not about the experience but about who you are with. Luckily I had a great time with my friends but the atmosphere was lacking, hard. \n\nBeen there, done that, don't need to go back."
2,"If i had written this after my first experience here it probably would have been a 5 star review. However, after my last trip all it really warrants is now a 2. My recent visits were during restaurant week and on most occasions the food was very good. Although i do think they should go back to the old macaroni and cheese dish with bacon instead of the lobster one but anyway.... The service the first time was impeccable. Had an all around great experience. Even got a card in the mail a week later thanking me for dining there. The latest time, it was just very disappointing. I get that generally the wait staff at restaurants hate restaurant week. It attracts people who have no idea about the concept of tipping on the original price, adding additional dishes etc. Well, i happen to understand all of these concepts and i don't appreciate being treated like  some jerk diner who will leave a shitty tip. During this visit the waitress barely spoke or acknowledged us. While we did order from the restaurant week menu each person in my party also ordered an additional sides. A bit later the servers tried to deliver our food to the wrong table, toward the end we had to flag someone down to get to-go boxes for our dessert. This kind of service is in my opinion unacceptable for one of the \""best steakhouses in Charlotte\"". I am not planning a return visit any time soon."
2,"Went to see Wind Rises here last Friday. \n\nI'd give the place 2.5 stars, but its a national chain, this location charges a premium, so there's no excuse. 2 stars. Besides, I have to up my 2 star stats. :P\n\nYeah, that pic of the dirty seat, very accurate. Gross. If it was just run-down, ie, the faux leather crumbling on the arm rest, it would've been forgivable. But no, there was still popcorn crumbs and stains on the seat. I wouldn't have cared if it was the $2 theatre on Trop, but I paid $11 for this ticket. Not to mention another $11 for popcorn and drink. \n\nThis place screams, \""take their money and run\"". I'm sure it's busy from tourists visiting Town Center, I doubt many locals go here because of the price. The bf has the AMC Stubs reward card, that you have to pay $12 to get. So, we try to go, once in awhile, so he can get use out of it. \n\nThe picture and sound were good. No complaints there. But I prefer the Regal chain over this place. It was much nicer when it was Rave theatre."
2,"A(lles) A(ndere) A(ls) A(lltag) ist das Allvitalis schon. Wer n\u00e4chtigt schon gerne auf einer Baustelle, bei der Bauherr nicht wei\u00df, wo er anfangen soll? Das Allvitalis ist zwar originell, aber \u00fcberall fehlt die Solidit\u00e4t, die auch den verlangten Preis rechtfertigen w\u00fcrde. Die Themenzimmer sind zwar auf Show getrimmt, doch schaut man genauer hin, dann kann man sich eigentlich nur \u00e4rgern. Das K\u00fcbler hat sich hier eine Laus in den Pelz gesetzt!"
2,"This location opened right opposite brickyard, and I was looking forward to trying this place for sometime. The experience, however, was a big disappointment. It took 20 min to prepare the order, needless to say this is too long for lunch take-out. The place ran out of boxes once our order arrived, so ended up taking the pizza in a foil wrapped package. The cheese on top did not like this and decided to stick to the foil and wouldn't let go. Dough was hardly impressive and very hard. Great location, below average food. Not visiting this place again."
2,"I was hoping for a wonderful Walgreens...due to its location.  But alas, all I got was a packed and overpriced store -- that was hard to navigate.  I could forgive the high prices -- due to its location -- but the layout (especially the check-out area) was not forgivable.  And since the Venetian next door was highway robbery to buy anything -- you would think that this place would try and be a lot lower with their prices.  Oh well."
2,"As a homegrown Las Vegas local, its sad to see where this place is now. \n\nBefore the 2 expansions, It was a excellent, hole-in-the-wall vietnamese restaurant. It was all the rave in town, constantly packed and everything about it was great. Great tasting hot broth and fresh vegetables and noodles. \n\nThen, the expansion. It seems that all the owner is thinking about now is maximizing profit. Such is apparent by the reduction in overall quality and waitstaff. Pho broth is bland, food is overpriced in accordance to the price and the service is negligible. I do have to say however their Chinese food isn't half bad. Although I'd rather go to K.J. Kitchen for that. \n\nMaybe I'm just being an elitist, or am still bummed that this place used to be so good. Nonetheless, this place is nothing more than average by far. \n\nAhh, then I discovered Saigon 8."
2,"Awesome food, TERRIBLE service. I recommend calling ahead with a take out order and eating their delicious food in the comfort of your own home. 2 stars for service and 4 stars for food. Just spent 2 hours there, watching people who had arrived after we did get their food and even leave before we got our main dishes. Food was great, won't be eating in the restaurant again."
2,"Well. After a five hour drive we had the wonderfully terrible experience of meeting TJ at the check in counter. The most unhelpful uninterested person on the planet. The reviews on here are correct, check in is a pain in the you know what and helpful service is apparently not in the employee manual. I haven't even seen our room yet....The room was something I would expect to find on Fremont street only our hotel there was cleaner, cheaper and much more friendly. The tropicana room smelled weird. Like smoke and cleaning fluid and must. Overall the bathroom and linens were clean, the tv was a nice flat screen and the bed was comfortable. Overall I would not stay here again, the service cast a shadow of ick over our Vegas experience. Go to the flamingo or MGM instead."
2,"The food here is top notch, don't know where to find better chicken and waffles. I keep coming back, but there's something wrong when I have bad service over half the time.\n\nI don't know what the deal is, but on more than one occasion we've had unpleasant waiters/waitresses. I don't ask for much at restaurants, but reflling water or asking for a couple more minutes to look at the menu should not warrant a skank face. Maybe the serving staff had a bad day... multiple times... during the same week...\n\nEh, who knows. I guess that makes it a \""legitimate\"" Southern experience, but regions don't excuse poor service. I suggest going for the classic combo, but don't be surprised if things go south from there..."
2,"False advertising on Travelocity. You will not get the newly remodeled rooms they show you on Travelocity. The pool chairs are disgusting. The two Yvonne's at the front desk are not very friendly at all. The food at the restaurant was nothing to write home about. No refrigerator and the bed hurt my back. Not sure how this place is still in business. I will NEVER stay here again. Not worth the drive, just stay in downtown Scottsdale or Talking Stick. \n\nThe two stars is for the hotel staff (not the front desk people) and the beautiful backdrop of the surrounding mountains."
2,"We really wanted to love this place!  We recently moved to the area and really miss having downtown Gilbert close by.  We took the boys after their football game a month ago and were really disappointed.  They didn't have any fries at lunch time...which is strange.  The place had an overwhelming smell of greasy food.  They were frying something!  The server was really sweet, and the kids really liked the popcorn machine...but the food is not worth returning... not for awhile!"
2,"Je donne la note de passage au Burger Bar, mais de justesse! Il y a place \u00e0 l'am\u00e9lioration et je m'attendais \u00e0 tellement plus!\nLes serveuses sont gentilles et attentionn\u00e9es.

2,"I really wanted to enjoy my experience at Indulge, but didn't. From the website, local magazine reviews, and driving by, I expected it to be a slightly upscale neighborhood joint, but it really is no different than a Fuddruckers.\nWe were underwhelmed by the food and hated the environment. Two of us built our own burgers, and one ordered a pre-made pick off the menu. We had the dill chips (fried pickles) as an appetizer. I can't say that any of us loved our meal, and as soon as we walked out we all agreed we weren't interested in going back. It was just no better than you could make at home (and I burn soup).  \nThe tables were crowded, too close together, and the place was uncomfortably noisy. Our servers were trying to clear plates as soon as one of us set down a fork (no one was waiting for our table), and asked for our dessert orders while we were still eating. \nThe whole experience was rushed, loud, uncomfortable, and not \""indulging\"" in any way. I'm so disappointed."
2,Not impressed at all. I heard they dd a big renovation and had all the goods from Fountainbleau.. Well. it still stinks like smoke.. looks nice but smells.. The bartenders were jerks.. Seriously.. I sit down with gf and a friend.. we order three drinks and he starts.. u gotta bet to get free drinks.. bla bla bla.. so i drop $5 in three machines fo us.. so I figure.. okay we should be good to go now.. for a drink.. my girl orders scotch.. he gets all. u gotta drop $10 per machine for scotch.. i was stunned how bad this clown was.. I was embarrassed for him it was such a stupid play for money.. So I drop $10 more in and say... here is your tip lets see what happens.. guess what.. he lost.. lol\n\nseriously.. total waste of space. get me drunk and i might drop a $1000 but piss me off and I leave.. its that simple people.. not going to waste my time at a smokers paradise like this.. so see ya
2,"Ummmm Pretty sure I have food poisoning.  We ate here today for the first time. The bread was rock hard and gave me a huge stomach ache.  I ordered some chicken dish for $18 which was worth about $4.95.  It was completely pounded out  to like the size of a phone book and less than a half inch thick.  In fact so was the steak. Very unpleasing to the eye, and the taste of everything was just all over LAMe-o.  Will not be going back."
2,"I had never been to the original version of the pink pony but decided to check it out as the new revamped version. I cannot say with any certainty what they are going for now. From what I know of the old place it was Old Arizona.  A concept which I feel is worth hanging on to. I think they are now attempting to attract the young Scottsdale crowd but they didn't seem to capture that space. My husband and I were by far the young ones in there. \n\nOur service was one of the worst parts. She was nice but not any good. She had no knowledge of the menu. I can't stand that. You work here, know your product. I would get fired from my job if I knew nothing about it. She also disappeared for a very long time so I had to hunt down someone else for ketchup for our fries and another soda. \nThe food itself was mediocre. I had the crispy chicken that wasn't crispy and my husband had the burger which was not a stand out. \n\nSomething else that I ALWAYS find to be an important way to know more about a restaurant is by visiting their bathroom. A truly good restaurant leaves no part of itself unattended. This place could have cared less. There was a soaking half used roll of toilet paper sitting on the vanity and crap all over the floor. \n\nThere was no part of my experience here that would ever make me go back."
2,We went for breakfast. The service sucked. The waitress unknowledgeable about the menu. Food was just ok. Nothing special nothing that makes them stand out. I can make all the same stuff at home. Bottom line we'll never return.
2,Went in during the week and place was not busy at all. Sat at the bar and waited a while for service and when the bartender did come over she seemed annoyed that I asked about happy hour and what beer was on tap. I will not be back anytime soon even though I have always liked this place.  I am in the business and can tell you that poor service turns away guests before bad food when it comes to the bar business.
2,"My husband and I ate here last night and I was disappointed and felt taken advantage of.  The experience as a whole was lovely, from the limo to the decor to the service.  But nothing - nothing - I ate blew me away, and I certainly did not leave feeling like the nearly $700 bill for the two of us was close to worthwhile.\n\nI will also add that my experience was very tainted by the fact that the moment we sat down, before we were given a wine list or cocktail menu, we were offered a glass of champagne.  Obviously we should not have accepted without requesting the menu first, but I was shocked to find that they automatically served us $45/glass Veuve without ever telling us that was what we were drinking or hinting at the price.   Nor was my husband informed that the tiny vegetable starter he ordered had a $50 surcharge when they asked him if he wanted to add bone marrow to it. I realize that for some people who dine at JR, money is no object.  And although we went there expecting to spend a lot, I did not feel that it was well spent.\n\n(I will add that when we questioned the bone marrow surcharge, it was graciously removed from the bill.  We did not say anything about the Veuve but I  suppose I was still in too much shock.)"
2,"Ehhhhh. When my favorite part of the meal is the salad, there's a problem with a seafood restaurant. \n\nI got the spinach and berries salad which was actually REALLY delicious, I ate every bite of it and I'm glad that I did because the crabcakes I ordered were horrible. So bad in fact that I sent them back. The clam chowder my friend ordered was kind of watery and might have had a good flavor, but it wasn't even that hot. Blech.\n\nOther friend got some shrimp dish and she really couldn't say much about it except \""meh\"". I was really dissapointed that we came here instead of one of the other places in Phoenix/Tempe because I've been here for work before and had much better food. I definitely won't be back next time I'm there for work!"
2,"Although the atomsphere was nice and quait, the wait time for a meal was long.  It took almost 40 minutes to get our food after we order it.   Also, I had the chicken quesadilla the chicken was so dry and overcooked I had to chew for ever to break it up.  I would not reccomend getting the grilled onions on it, makes it soggy"
2,"Located in Boca Park on Rampart Boulevard, Summerlin. This upscale Vietnamese, multimillion dollar restaurant is drop dead gorgeous with beautiful art work displayed throughout, a waterfall and fish swimming under a section of the floor. We were under time constraints so we decided to pass on appetizers and salads. I ordered the grilled tiger prawns served with their famous garlic noodles. My wife's entre - Mama's ginger steamed sea bass served with fresh ginger, shitake mushrooms and scallions was on the bland side. Overall we loved the restaurant's dcor as well as the service, but felt the food was slightly disappointing given the MSRP on the menu."
2,"After visting several times and loving every time with a great eclectic menu, great wine selection and bourbon specials who wouldn't.....but last night I finally talked a few friends that ususally don't leave their \""Southpark Bubble\"" into coming towards uptown and we were very disappointed.  There were 5 of us and they were out of the first 4 wine choices and the one recommended was not tasty at all.  We went to a higher priced bottle that was fine and they DID take the first bottle off the menu and apologize profusely.  They have also changed their menu to more mainstream items, and the roof top was closed.  I won't be going for a while and my Southpark friends will stay close to home!"
2,"WEDDING DAY RIPOFF: I'm only giving this salon two stars because my hair did end up looking nice for my wedding. BUT the pricing is totally misleading. I checked their website and called to double check on wedding updo pricing and they both said I could expect to pay about $100. Fine. But I showed up to my appointment with completely dry hair and my stylist insisted he needed to blow dry it \""for volume.\"" I have nice thick hair and the style I asked for didn't require much volume at all. I asked him three times not to blow dry it and his best response was \""I'll only charge you half for the blow dry.\"" Great. Not only that, but they don't tell you they charge an additional fee for curling your hair as part of the updo. Pretty sneaky. Now I'm not stupid. I know a salon in a nice hotel in Vegas is going to cost you, but what I was quoted and what my bridesmaids and I ended up paying was almost $100 more. Oh and one last thing we weren't happy about was that all of us started losing hair pins before the ceremony. If we pay an arm and a leg for a certain hair style, it had better stay in place for at least a couple hours."
2,"I stopped in on a rainy afternoon. My arthritis was flaring up really bad because of the humidity. We were all hungry so we turned onto Main st and end spotted Griff's and gave it a try.\n      I was disappointed they wouldn't let me use my own teapot that I came in with, but there tea was pretty decent. My waitress was at least 350 lbs but she had a warm smile.  I was pretty hungry but I only had enough for a muffin. We sat inside for around 5 hours until the rain let up - I drank a lot of tea lol"
2,"Service was horrible. We were not ready to order the first time we were asked, but about 25 minutes later we sure were. Appetizers were good. \n\nI should have known better than to order steak from a fish place, but I did it anyway. Medium rare at this place has almost no pink left in the center. My buddy sent his back, I won't do that. \n\nMy second beer didn't look or taste anything like the first one. If you don't remember just ask me. I'll tell you what kind of beer I ordered. \n\nI might try again, but if I got the same waitress I'd run."
2,"We went here primarily due to the fact that the bar we wanted to go to was closed for remodeling through mid december (Fat Tuesday).  We took two trips into here within a few hours of each other with two somewhat different experiences.  The first was at 3 for the happy hour drink specials which was as advertised except the fact that we had a VERY un-attentive  waiter which resulted in delayed drinks each time we got his attention.  The second time we asked to be seated outdoors which was half full yet appeared to have adequate service staff.  WRONG!  We were there for 17 minutes with only a menu and a glass of water which was delivered promptly by the hostess when seated.  When we left as we were walking down back onto the strip the hostess stated \""you weren't helped yet?\"" which sounds like is fairly typical and my answer was no and she apologized.  The appetizer of catfish nuggets were pretty good for bar food as was the artichoke dip that was great.  Food however takes people to request it from and to deliver so get your stuff together and this would be a good bar right on the strip."
2,"Very dissapointed in our visit. Went on a Saturday night. The waiting area was very disorganized. The resturant is congested when busy and awkward getting around. They give you a small metal bowl with directions on how to fill it and then take it over to the grill guys. The line, which is like a buffet, was slow and awkward especailly getting the vegetables. If you have someone who doesn't know what they want in front of you, it holds up the whole line. They do have 2 lines (both were slow). \n\nBetween the people and the awful sounding loud music, it was hard to hear even sitting across the table. Service was a bit slow. And to top it off, my wife, who was wearing white pants, sat in some spilled soy sauce and stained the back of her pants. The waitress offered some napkins. The manager seemed like he didn't give a crap. Waitress should have wiped the seat after the last table.\n\nThe food was good, not fantastic, but good. The bowl didn't fill me but didn't want to go through that again so I didn't opt with the endless bowl. We basically served ourselves. There is really no need for any waitresses.\n\nGood luck!"
2,"I've been wanting to try this restaurant for a while now and finally made it out for Arizona Restaurant Week. Unfortunately I did not have a good experience. The waiter my partner and I had was so unattentive. After we were seated we had to specifically ask for the restaurant week menus since they weren't provided to us to make sure we were only charged the special price for Restaurant Week. Not once throughout our entire meal did our waiter come by to refill our drinks and we were never offered a bread basket that all of our surrounding tables were provided by other waiters. It took forever to get our food while parties that were seated after us were receiving their meals before us. We both ordered the pina colada cake dessert it took over twenty minutes for us to receive our cake slices. Food was okay, service was horrible."
2,"I have had shoe leather easier to chew, the pie showed up barely warm and missing its salad. When the salad did arrive it was a sorry excuse and there was no fork. The only thing going for the order was the good amount of toppings."
2,"It was dead on a Friday night, across the street from a hoppin' movie theater. That alone should have told me to temper down my expectations. The staff were super friendly, but the menu in place differs from what their website and Yelp show: new menu has more items but is more expensive too.\n\nThe asada fries I was originally considering are now up to $11- nevermind.\nOrdered their tacos azules: one fish, one shrimp; and a basic carnitas taco. Salsa bar is pretty basic with a hot, a mild, and a spicy option, and limes.\n\n Opened my takeout order to find three azules-style tacos- the carnitas was topped with cabbage and a cream sauce instead of cilantro and onions. \nCarnitas was dry and crispy, fish and shrimp were mediocre: fish was baked and flavorless instead of baja style; bay shrimp were tiny and bland.\n \nNot thrilled that I spent $10 for three tiny street tacos,  ate 1.5 before tossing the rest. Poor value- I suspect the management raised prices to accommodate for their lack of traffic. \nMaybe cut your staff instead: friendly or not, it doesn't take four people to run this place. I was the only customer, and somehow managed to they overcharge me and mess up my order."
2,"This place has top notch marketing. With a name like Noodle ChaCha and a cute Pucca-looking girl as their mascot, how could I not get sucked in?!!!\n\nThe restaurant is a building by itself so its not hard to miss. My group and I came around lunch time and the place was practically empty. Servers greeted us and gave us the lunch specials. I ordered the thai fried rice with sweet and sour soup. They were also running a $1 milktea special which of course I got however, DO NOT ORDER THE MILK TEA. The drink was so watered down it pretty much just tasted like mud water. It was disgusting. The $1 was not worth it. The sweet and sour soup was done alright. Kind of bland for my taste buds. The thai fried rice also did not taste very good. It seemed like something that I could have made at home.... and it didn't seem very fresh either. They topped it with chinese dried shredded pork......... uhhhh WHHAAT?! I thought that was pretty odd........ Overall, I might give this place another shot with their noodles but as of right now, Pucca lookalike did not impress."
2,"The service wasn't all that great and the sushi wasn't anything to write home about either. The lady that served us tried to be funny but was sort of rude. She felt too comfortable with us I think. I'm all for being personable, but I am still a guest and expect to be treated as such and not just a \""bro\""..."
2,"THe first time we visited this place. The food was really good. We ordered the chicken puff, egg puff and few pastries. THe pastriess were really amazing and by far the best I have tasted in the US.\nNow the not so good things:\n1.) service is horrible.\n2.) They dont even serve you water and you have to ask for it. In spite of asking the server forgot my water(not once but twice)\n3.)Service is extremely slow.\n4.) The second time I went, the chicken puff was stale. When I informed the manager about it he was really not bothered.\nI will go again here only for the pastries."
2,"If you're the kind of person who's into beads, buttons, earrings and anything else that's ridiculously small and brightly coloured, then you'll love this place.\n\nIf, like me, the idea of spending half an hour in a tiny shop filled with more different colours than a Dulux paint chart is not your idea of fun, the you should probably steer clear. I've been dragged in here by friends a few times, and every time i come out I swear I actually have a headache.\n\nTo be fair to it though, this shop is good if you're stuck for present ideas. I know blokes are always complaining that women are hard to buy for, but there are so many handbags, belts and jewellery that you can't go wrong, in particular they have body jewellery for every single body piercing you can think of."
2,"My co-worker called in an order at 1:30 pm, well after lunch rush and was told by the lady that answered the phone that \""she needed to order right now or forget it\"".  Ummmm, seriously?? She's lucky it wasn't me that called it in.  She would have gotten a piece of my mind and NOT received the order.  Luckily for them, she is a lot nicer than me.  \n\n1 Star is for my co-workers Carne Asada Burrito, she says it is \""the bomb\"".\n1/2 Star is for my rice that is fairly tasty.\n1/2 Star is for the delivery being fairly quick.\n\nI got just a ground beef/bean burrito with lettuce/sour cream/cheese.  Pretty much tasted like Taco Bell's Burrito Supreme.  Nothing to write home about...at all.\n\nOverall completely irritated I wasted good money on this place. \n\nGet SOMEONE ELSE to answer your phone if you want repeat business!!!!"
2,"Soggy overpriced fast food burger with allot of hype. When you have to cover the walls with quotes how good your product is, then you have to something to hide."
2,"It was hard to give this place 2 stars as the food was DELICIOUS!  The location is awesome and we had a great table by the window.  The view is great.  The service was horrible.  They were having some computer problems.  It would have been great if the server came and explained that to us, instead he just disappeared and I guess was trying to fix it.  I am not a needy diner by any means, however, our wine glasses were empty for a while (which we spent $70 per glass for), we would have ordered dessert but it just took too long.  It was almost like we were forgotten.  Spending almost $300 for 2 people should get you AMAZING service."
2,"We elected to try this \""sushi\"" restaurant under the current owners after nearly a year and, unfortunately, it has not improved.  Under the previous owners the fish was always fresh and well prepared and the \""sushi chef owner and his assistant\"" were always full of great banter and responded honestly to which fish selections that day had the best taste.  Very much in a true traditional sushi bar manner!  This evening I ordered traditional sushi pieces just to see how the preparation and taste would turn out--hamachi, sake, ono, maguro, unagi, saba, ama ebi, etc.  No rolls!  Starting with the rice it tasted somewhat bland (a starch taste) and no hint of wasabi.  As the fish pieces came out some had a \""fresh frozen\"" taste.  The \""hamachi\"" had the best appeal but not by much.  The \""ono\"" was thinly sliced and the unagi sauce was bland.  The oil used in frying the \""ama ebi\"" needs to be changed and the \""shrimp head\"" itself was pretty small.  I could go on but I think that speaks for itself.  If you desire a true and traditional sushi experience you might want to go somewhere else!"
2,"i've been here a couple of times, but last weekend will most likely be my last. Perhaps i'm just too old now to enjoy waiting in line, or being pushed around like a herd of cattle, or pay $16 for a crappy cranberry and vodka...but Pure has just lost it's charm for me. \n\nThe club itself is pretty, the roof is my favorite part. If i were to go back, that's the only place I would stay if I could have it my way."
2,this in and out messes up on my order twice now will drive down to the one in san tan mall from now on
2,"Not really an ' employment ' or temp firm. They offer seasonal, workload-based jobs outbound calling political surveys. Work is on a day-to-day, start time is 2:30 pm, and end time varies daily based on workload. $9/hr. many days you will call in to schedule and they won't be able to 'place' you for weeks. Do not bother applying or wasting time interviewing here. A/k/a mcguire research. Just work at a DQ drive thru nextdoor- 100x more legit\nThe management clearly treats the employees like they are all trash and jokes about preying on old disabled and poor."
2,"Avec un nom comme J'm La Frite, quand une envie de poutine, de burger ou de frite nous prends, c'est assez difficile \u00e0 ignorer. Cet endroit est un peu bizarre par contre. C'est d\u00e9finitivement une place pour avoir du fast-food, mais on dirait que l'endroit essaie un peu trop fort d'\u00eatre plus chic que \u00e7a n'a besoin de l'\u00eatre. Un peu comme un ado qui s'habille en complet pour une entrevue pour une job au McDo. J'ai pris un panini jambon fromage et bien qu'il \u00e9tait bon, et m\u00eame chaud, il n'\u00e9tait pas press\u00e9 comme je m'y attendais, et je me suis demand\u00e9e s'il y avait vraiment du fromage. Mon chum a pris un burger qui avait l'air correct et une poutine, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 probablement le meilleur plat qu'on ai command\u00e9. La sauce est tr\u00e8s bonne et les crottes de fromages sont fra\u00eeches, grosses et elles font squeak-squeak comme elles le devraient, avant d'avoir commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 fondre. Pour la poutine, \u00e7a valu la peine, pour le reste, je me suis sentie pas mal \""meh.\"" Au total \u00e7a nous a co\u00fbt\u00e9 un peu plus de 20 dollars pour tout \u00e7a, donc je ne trouve pas qu'on ai vraiment eu de la valeur pour notre argent."
2,"Picazzo's ... where have you gone? You used to be one of my favorite places to visit but you have fallen from grace. Service was good and I appreciate that but the food was sub-par. My salad arrived with a variety of greens that were not listed on the menu and my server apologizing for the substitution. You might have asked me if I wanted kale... I did not. That's why I didn't order the kale salad. The lettuce was brown on the edges and the $1.50 I paid for a sliver of avocado was ridiculous. I can't decide if I'll try you again or not.  I appreciate your nod to health, but meh..."
2,"When eating a meal on \""The Strip\"" one would assume that the service and food are above par.  Sadly this is not the case for Diablo's Cantina.  The service was lacking and there was no sense of urgency or follow up...it took almost 20 minutes for us to even be acknowledged and we were sitting at the bar/counter.  When we finally found a server and asked for a menu, the response was a finger point and a mummbled \""ask the bartender, not me\"".  When the food made its appearance it was bland and lacking any spice and flavor.  Overall I the experience at Diablo's was a let down and I will most likely never return or suggest it to visitors."
2,"This is the place to drink.....and thats about it.\n\nDisappointed with this place althoughI wasn't expecting a ton.  Looked like a nice beer selection with pretty decent prices so I probably should have just sticked to that.\n\nI ordered a salad (bar and salad usually dont mix i know) but I thought what the heck.  The salad was average at best and at $13 I would have expected a lot more.  The other stuff on the menu might be better, but I'm in no hurry to find out.  \n\nOverall, looks like a good place to booze and watch the game and in the grand scheme of things, thats not a bad deal."
2,"The Rockin' Railroad class is great but beware that you cannot make up any classes after the semester is over.  Between my toddler's nap schedule, my work schedule, and the times that the class is offered, I found it difficult to take any make up classes.  We only need to make up two more and the owner would not make any exceptions.  I can't help that my child was sick and I kept him home so that he wouldn't spread his illness.  Now all they can offer us is time to use the play gym, which is not what I originally paid for.  It's very disappointing that a simple request could not be granted.  We have attended other classes where the instructor would happily make up classes after the session was over.  We won't be returning."
2,"I enjoyed it the first time I went because it was late and it's open 24 hours, but after a couple of more visits I've decided it's not the spot for me. The drinks and food are so-so and overpriced. But I'm really disappointed with their wi-fi policy. They're not only forcing people to buy something in order to get the password, but you have to buy every hour and a half to keep using it. That's ridiculous and inconvenient. Plus the furniture could use some upkeep, especially the leather couches/benches."
3,"Buon Gusto Gourmet Pizzas & Salads is what remains from the falling out with the Picazzo's chain.  The devotion to local, organic foods remains.  Frequent deals arriving in my inbox remain.  But my two favorite pizzas are dead.  I don't know if they were nixed by Picazzo's or Buon Gusto, but I loved those pizzas.  The first casualty was called something like the Chipotle Barbacoa.  It is the best pizza I have ever had.  It had barbacoa meat on top with some sort of cheese sauce that may have involved chipotles.  It was topped with jalapenos.  This pizza was actually spicy.  Not restaurant spicy, but actually spicy.  The next casualty was originally called That's Italian and then later renamed Spicy Italian.  It consisted of the combination of pepperoni and salami.  And it had this delicious tapenade with olives and carrots.  That's right, carrots.  I told my dad that the tapenade had carrots, and he didn't believe it.  He still had trouble believing it when I pointed out the carrots to him on our next visit.  May they rest in peace.  At this point, I'm just not excited by what remains on the menu.  Everything is good.  My daughter gets her usual mushroom and cheese pizza.  On our last visit, my wife confided to me that her favorite pizza was also deceased, and she is also no longer excited about Buon Gusto.  Now I know why we go less frequently."
3,"Low end Mexican food in a Vegas strip environment. Sweet, watery margaritas, no chips & salsa (maybe available if you order as an appetizer). No salsa with the tacos. Come for cheap eats (by LV strip standards)."
3,"This ain't no Golden Corral. This buffet is super fancy schmancy with over 500 menu items and not for the faint of heart.\n\nHave a well thought out game plan before you try to attack this gianormous buffet. I'm not even talking in terms of maximizing your dollar, but enjoying the smorgasbord of cuisines. I personally liked the cured meats & cheese, kobe beef sliders, prime rib, some kind of tuna sashimi salad, and all the dessert offerings.\n\nThe Bacchanal receives my buffet stamp of approval and 3.5 stars based on its' high quality food and massive grandness."
3,Makmak was decent. Not super delicious and slightly overpriced. They carry singha. The tom yum was slightly unusual and not fantastic but I have had worse. The spring rolls were normal. The pork dumplings were good. Good peanut sauce. I haven't tried the pad thai so I cannot judge. Service was good. Cute place too.
3,"Stopped by to return a trailer that we hauled from Seattle, WA - there was about a 15 min wait while other customers are serviced by the 2 available employees.  We had misplaced our paperwork in the hectic hustle of moving , but the employee was gracious enough to look up our information on the computer. \n\nThe only thing I would ding on is the professionalism of the employees - it was wretched hot, & one of the employees questioned if the co-worker was wearing deodorant; this was in front of a handful of customers.  But then again, I come here for the equipment, not for the mind-blowing service. \n\nAll in all, I have no qualms about returning for equipment rentals.  Easily accessible location, spacious lot, & honestly, there's no other competition in town.  Also, they tend to be slammed Fri-Sun, so be prepared to wait."
3,"I like this library, I really do. My only gripe is the story time for kids. At the end of story time, the kids get a stamp on their hand. One story time counselor always ways seems to skip over the louder children in the room. I have a 2 year old and he enjoys story time but gets a little excited. Twice he hasn't gotten a stamp. I wouldn't be writing this review but it's kind of a big deal to him. The first time I just thought the counselor missed him but the second time had blatant eye contact. He sat there with his hands on top of his head and then no stamp.  I was annoyed so we left. Its a great library and we look forward to story time whenever we can make it. Just include all the kids in the hand stampin is all I'm sayin."
3,"Who knew!? \n\nI didn't really understand the concept of \""Twin Peaks\"" until I came back from Vegas.  Hey we have one here too in Scottsdale.  My first thought when I walked in here -- \""Wow the girls here are pretty hot\""!  Compared to the usual UFC fight nights at Hooters this place definitely \""out-hots\"" Hooters by miles.  \n\nFood wise I think its okay at best.  I huge portions and Men/Girl size options.  Guess they're trying to be cute just like one of their dessert option (Scenic View - NC) is actually the waitresses NO COST.  Fair enough since they are smokin.  Needless to say, the food is bar food.  The burger I ordered had way more bun then beef.  I did enjoy the fingerling potato fries and the Nacho is a massive mound! --- Get it!? Anyways, carry on.....\n\nThe place itself is like walking into an REI store except you can't buy anything and hot chicks.  Overall, a cover charge of $5 for a UFC is cool.  I probably wouldn't come here for the food.  The \""Scenic View\"" is a plus, but I'm not one for cheap thrills. - Enjoy!"
3,"The food is great, probably the best I've had in Asian food BUT I have noticed the prices consistently rising over time and in my opinion they are getting a little to high for what you are getting.  12 dollars for a plate of chicken fried rice is high even if the food is good and the soup is just a broth with a little sliced up onion in it wow.   If you have eaten here I'd like to hear what you think about the prices compared to other Asian restaurants.  I'm going to try the Little Saigon in Glendale next, it's a Vietnamese restaurant with a 5 star rating."
3,"I have been wanting to try New York Flavor ever since I moved to Surprise. Unfortunately, I was not as impressed as I thought I would be. \n\nThe service is pretty good. Since it was my first time, I asked the woman at the counter if there were any \""favorites\"". She was very helpful in explaining the menu items. \n\nI ended up ordering the Spanish Harlem with a side of potato salad. First, let's talk about the potato salad. It came in a TINY little cup. I am talking, like two bites of potato salad. I wish I had saved the little cup to take a picture. I almost felt like I was being pranked. I paid $1.99 for this potato salad. I expected to be able to eat more than two bites of it. And, to be honest, the two bites of potato salad I had weren't the greatest. It tasted like potato salad you could buy at the grocery store; nothing to write home about.\n\nThe sandwich itself was pretty good. The spread was flavorful and the steak was cooked perfectly. The bread was just okay. The sandwich was $8.99, which felt a little pricey to me based on the size of the sandwich.\n\nAll in all, the service is there, but the food here just isn't something I would expect to receive if I were actually in New York, which is the impression I got from the reviews and the restaurant itself."
3,"Nice new place in Goodyear.  Attractive interior (unsurprising, as it's brand new).  Very, very good thin crust - not NY or Chicago-style.  I'm a native NYer, and I've been searching for a great NY-style slice for about a year now.  This isn't it, but it's still very good pizza.  From what I can tell, they use a higher quality cheese than any of their competition in the West Valley that I've tried thus far.  It's certainly not 5-star pizza, but it's better than many of the other options on this side of Phoenix."
3,"This second location for Lukes of Chicago keeps the tradition alive and well on the northeast side of the valley.\n\nLunch at this location can vary; I have been here at 12:30 and walked right up to put in my order, I have been here at 2pm in a line of 8 people. \n\nI usually order the chili cheese dog and it's always wonderful and sloppy. Word of caution though, it comes very hot so let that dog cool down a bit before diving in. I also enjoy the fact that many menu items come with fries as they serve a great crinkle cut version.\n\nOn the downside, I have had my order \""lost\"" once at this location. To their credit it was a very busy lunch rush and it's a small place. Using the old style written tickets means these things can happen if one falls on the floor or gets bundled with someone else's ticket.\n\nIf you're in Scottsdale and don't want to fuss with the fancy places or typical fast food fodder, give Luke's of Chicago a shot. It's nestled in the strip mall area directly next to Sam's Club/Walmart."
3,"I thought Vegas buffets were supposed to be better... yes the display looked nicer, but the food was still... ehhh it's still a damn buffet."
3,"Definitely a delectable menu with a very classy yet stylish ambience. \n\nSteaks, poultry, fish, and duck are big on the menu. If you're into duck, sushi, or tartare you'll enjoy the appetizer selections otherwise opt for lobster artichoke soup or the sprout pear and bacon salad. \n\nThe meats are very well prepared and incredibly rich. Presentation was fantastic. \n\nI was quite surprised by the extremely slow service. We rarely saw our heavily French accented server though his support staff was always close by for water. I enjoy long eventful dining experiences but this was not eventful; it was almost boring. We spent most of the time with empty glasses or no bread and there's no server around to even request another drink.  \n\nAt the end of our meal, we shared the white chocolate ganache dessert because of how full we were. It was a little medicinal in flavor, licorice maybe? We ate half, then the aforementioned support staff cleaned the table. Approx 15 empty glass minutes later, our server made his 3rd appearance of the night to say that the dessert was well worth the wait. He had no clue that we already had it, didn't like it, and were done with it. \n\nI would give 3.5 stars. Honestly the food is fantastic but the service really killed the experience. Maybe sitting in the bar area would be better."
3,"Your typical native new yorker, a nicer location than most because it used to be a local restaurant.  Typical sports grill fare, good amount of wing flavors."
3,"So are you guys going to to have water or do you want anything else... The food was great but the service from our server was lackluster. We got a salad, two pizzas, three appetizers, two glasses of wine and a pitcher yet our server seemed to think we were going to be a table of water and pizza. Food was great but our server couldn't get it right. Missed drinks and wrong orders; for my first time at Federal Pizza, I don't know if I'd necessarily come back as a result of the service."
3,"Big, sweaty, beefy dudes from all over eastern Europe. Athletic, sexy, flexible and half naked women crawling on top of everything. Acrobatics. Water Stunts. A blur of bodies grinding and groping each other. A two hour thrill ride of sexual intensity I won't soon forget.\n\nWhen it was over... i toweled off and took a shower. Then I left my condo to check out \""Le Reve\"" at the Wynn. \n\nNot really a big deal."
3,"This particular location has a bit of a bipolar staff. Some days you get the nicest baristas, who take time and make suggestions, which make me want to come back! Other times, you are just left with the hope you have caught someone on a really bad day. I just hope my visits start to lean toward the better days!"
3,"Service was good, food was over-salted (not over seasoned because it lacked flavor). I attempted to come again bit they were charging for the super bowl as if they paid to stream it. prices are very steep in comparison to other wing places. $.85 a wing is unheard of, I'm used to paying 50 to 6 cents a wing."
3,"While I was waiting for my takeout order, there was a party of 4 seniors (non-Asian) leaving with big smiles on their faces.  One of the females then said \""This is our favorite restaurant in town!  Everything is always great!\"".  She then grabs all the business cards sitting by the cashier and walks out the door saying \""We have GOT to get you some more business!\"".\n\nI stared at the takeout menu for a good 15 minutes.  It's freakin Chinese food!  I know what I like!!  I didn't know what was taking me so long but I ended up ordering the ma po tofu and house special lo mein.  I then think about how I can't remember the last time I ordered ma po tofu to go as I'm driving home.\n\nNOW I REMEMBER why I don't.  Everything in the takeout bag was a total mess of sauce.  I won't make that mistake again.  The tofu dish was great.  They used ground chicken instead of pork which made it taste a bit lighter than usual and the rest of the sauce that stayed in the container was pretty good.  \n\nThe noodles on the other hand were sub par.  I wish I had read Clint B's review before making the order.  I totally agree with his opinion on the lo mein and wouldn't order it again.  Excessive oil.  Chef's gone wild!\n\nI fully plan on coming back for the Peking duck which will most likely change my whole opinion of this place."
3,"They're in the middle of remodel.  I stayed in one of the newly remodeled rooms and it was great.  Bed was super comfy, room was spacious and clean.  We had a nice view down (up? I'm never sure in Vegas) the strip.  The crowd is still a bit low-rent, which was a drag.  If they can keep things nice until the remodel is finished, this will again be a great place to go. The people  were all really great, except the cabana girl (her snotty attitude took them from four stars to three and cost them $)."
3,"The Girlfriend and I came here for breakfast after a night stay there in the Hooters Hotel and Casino. Dan Marino's is located in the Hooters Hotel and  serves breakfast till 12pm. We chose the breakfast buffet because we received a coupon book with a coupon for a 2 for 1 buffet meal when we signed up for the free players club card. Regular price of buffet, $10. Buffet consist of all the basic breakfast goods. Scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage links and patties, diced potatoes and dry cereal. They also had waffles with strawberries as choice for topping. The waffles weren't too bad, tasted more like a thick pancake though.  There was even a bread pudding sort of kinda thing. Oh and fruit, can't forget the fruit. Watermelon, cantelope, pineapple, orange and pink grapefruit slices. Buffett meals include coffee,milk, oj or soda. All in all it was a good bargin and good food."
3,"Now don't get me wrong, The Southern is a nice little bar in the Newington area of town. The decor is nice, it's well laid out and there is plenty of room. \n\nHowever, the question I have to ask myself is... Do I need another identical burger menu? Because as a reasonably regular visitor of Holyrood 9A and Red Squirrel, I'm seeing this menu pretty frequently, as menus go. \n\nClearly the burger formula is working well for the owners of all three establishments, but to be honest I would have liked something a little bit different. They are all the same. There's also not much else on offer except burgers, so if you're not feeling a filling between two hunks of roll then you're probably not going to like it much here. \n\nOh, and the food is served on a wooden slab. Why do restaurant owners hate crockery so much all of a sudden?\n\nStill, my burger was tasty. I enjoyed it. But I fail to see how this place cuts itself in a different way from its sisters."
3,"For an upscale Vegas hotel, the rooms were...surprising not that exciting. We got some average-priced hotel rooms with the slant, but the elevator ride up was a nightmare (each elevator was a bit shaky, or noisy, or made sounds) and while the pyramid soap was interesting, the lack of wifi in the room wasn't that great.\nThe main casino floor was nice - semi-easy to get lost in, if you weren't paying attention, but easy enough to navigate after a bit. The pool was nice, but a lot of the stuff is expensive.\nOtherwise, it was ok. Not the best, but it was ok."
3,"If Bistro on the Avenue were to launch today in any other location, it would not survive, due to its price point and lack of creativity.  However, it is a favorite among Westmount locals, and is a viable option if you live nearby and don't feel like cooking.  In other words, we would not go out of our way with the intent of coming here, but we also wouldn't mind revisiting this long-standing establishment every now and then."
3,We ate here twice while at the casino. The food was okay a lot better than you would expect in a casino. The onion straws were very good
3,"Just went here for my first time with some friends.  \n\nNice layout, pool tables in the back, couple dart boards up front, and a buck hunting game that didn't work (that's okay, don't need drunk people in THIS town shooting stuff up before they drive home) and a nice outdoor seating area to smoke, if nicotine is your thing!\n\nThe bartenders were friendly and the prices were great compared to the local Westgate neighbors (tall beer was only $2 bucks).  \n\nOf course, for the location, there was a fair share of crooked hats \""tough guy\"" mentalities, but it was fun.  The only weird thing was the dude holding down the bathroom.  The boombox in the Men's room was about as louder as the DJ booth.  It was one of those bathroom host-gigs where a guy expects you to tip him for using the sink or whatever.  He had little candies in baskets and blow pops but I just walked on by.  I guess, to Diego here, it's kind of weird to tip a guy a buck for handing you a free towel and a mint.  \n\nBut hey, check this place out!  Can't go wrong with a strobe lit bathroom and a basket of Starburst on your way out to the dance floor!  If for nothing else, you can tell your wife when she asks what your lazy self did all day you can say \""Honey, relax.  I went to 'The Gym'\""."
3,"Frances has amazing sales. I'll admit their merchandise is a wee bit pricey, however, you can find some really unique things - gifts especially! I really love this store, really, I do..but I try to avoid it because most of the time I cannot afford it. I wish they would carry a wider price range. Anyway - I'm just being cheap."
3,"When I visited over a year ago I had the best seafood plate ever... full of shrimp, crab claws and the best baked oysters ever. I waited a full year to have it again, so I was disappointed that it wasn't in the menu anymore. I got a stuffed Iobster dish instead... It was good, but not what I'd waited a year for. I also had issues with cork being in all of our wine... even when they took it back to try again... Twice!\nIf I had reviewed for my first visit it would've been 5 stars, but my most recent visited bumps it down to 3."
3,"This is the second time we ate here. I don't remember much of the first, I think my daughter was still baby and was fussy that night so we didn't stay long. Anyways, this time the restaurant was ok.\n\nThe restaurant looks very nice, and it's clean. The chairs are too low for the tables, though. I wasn't the only one who felt like I needed a highchair. The actual high chairs they brought for our toddlers were almost the same height as our chairs, leaving the kids with no chance to see the top of the table, let alone the show. They had to stand on our laps to see anything and I ended up holding a plate at my daughter's level for her to eat.\n\nThe service was very good. All the waiters and the chef were friendly and accomodating. We had a young child with us, who was a little scared of some of the flashy parts of the dining show, so the chef toned it down a little for her, but still put on a great show.\n\nThe sushi and accompanying appetizers were excellent! Oh, it was sooo good. The rest of the dinner, however, left me a smidgen dissappointed. The chef added a pink paste to everything he cooked. On the one hand, it had an interesting flavor. On the other hand, it made everything taste the same. He may as well have just fried up some pink paste and served us just that. :\\\n\nI would go back for the sushi."
3,Nice hotel! I like to stay here all the time. Eventho they have no cirque du soleil shows and it's preety boring here beside.\nThe parties at the marquee are preety annoying and the drunk people control the hotel.
3,"Nice, clean-cut decor, great menu, kid-friendly and super service.  Need more?\n\nWe went for lunch and the menu options were interesting and adequate for the most choosy patron.  Tried the tempura battered asparagus with chili ranch and they were delicious.  Wish the portion was larger.\n\nHoagie sandwiches were great.  Many like Philly steak-cheese, but these were upscale with sliced prime rib.  Wife had variety with spinach and cheese, I had mine with mushrooms, onions and cheese.  Rolls were soft and your salivating mouth could easily take in the sandwich.   Make certain that you bite into your sandwich over a plate or you will have a dry cleaning bill for sure.  Very juicy.\n\nFries were perfectly fried.\n\nWill give it a try for dinner, but bet it will be crowded as it is pretty good."
3,"Nice place, the appitizers were good. The steak was so... so... the reason it was so... so... was because I was here for a bachelor party and we had a set menu. I probably will come again to order a better quality steak, because the appetizers and the side orders were good. The ambiance and service was good."
3,"We wanted to eat light so we chose this place. It is located inside the Paris Hotel Casino and our hostess sat us on the outside edge of the restaurant where we could people watch.\n\nI ordered a fish dumping noodle bowl and my wife ordered won ton style soup bowl. We also chose a plate of  mini pork buns when the lady with the dim sum cart rolled by.\n\nOverall it was an okay dining experience. Both our soup bowls were very tasty but they were on the small side for pho. Our pork buns were a little dry also. I paid $46 bucks including tip for this mini meal which is on the expensive side for pho, but were in Vegas so...."
3,"Their half sammiches are gigantic.  The ciabatta bread was very good, and word on the street is that the nine-grain is to die for.  \n\nSomething in my roast beef provolone sammich didn't sit right with my stomach though.  I may be reverting back to the Jimmy John's 2 doors down for my 'wich fix now."
3,"Not exactly sure why the Secret Garden and the Dolphin Habitat are listed separately on Yelp since one admission price gets you into both.  So here's my comments on the Secret Garden side.  1.  It's expensive.  I asked at the ticket counter for a military discount or local discount (yes, I qualify).  Nope.  So $69 for 2 adults and 2 children.  The Secret Garden is small.  It's not the amount of tigers and lions - it's the size of their habitats.  No home was large enough for any of the animals to engage in a sprint.  It could have been the 90+ temperatures, or not, but in the middle of the afternoon all the animals were sloth-like.  I started to feel kind of bad for them.  But then Siegfried was there!  And I asked him to take a picture with my kids, and he obliged.  If it wasn't him, it was the best impersonator ever, complete with German accent (I'm sure it was actually him).  I'll talk about the Dolphins in a separate review.  Bottom line - cool, but no value."
3,"I have had better Hawaiian cuisine elsewhere, but I like this place because of it's value. It seems like that whatever you order you get a whole lot of it which is great when you are on a budget. Every time I go to this place I always have to order the mac salad and the spam musubi. Their chicken katsu is also nicely done, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I like to come to this place when I'm feeling really hungry and I'm in need of \""stick to your ribs\"" kind of food. This place will definitely leave you full for a very long time."
3,"This was meal one in my 3 day visit and AZ Mexican food tour. I had a lovely dinner with my brother, aunt and uncle at Arriba's.  I wasn't thrilled but here is the lowdown:\nChips... 4 stars, they were crisp and warm good salsa and bean dip.\n\nService  3 stars, the server was informative and friendly but she forgot my uncle's extra hot salsa and he didn't get it until 1/2 way through the meal.\n\nFood 2-4 stars, my green corn tamale was just okay, it was dry and lacked the \""corny\"" flavor that I was after.  My uncle really enjoyed his Chile \n\nDecor.. 3 stars, nothing to write home about but okay.  I agree that it didn't seem very clean.\n\nIf I have a choice I would choose a single store mom and pop in the future."
3,"My boyfriend and I wanted to check out this new place and see how their barbecue was. It was pretty good. He ordered a whiskey, which they have a nice selection of, and I got a tap beer. It was served so ice cold and stayed cold for quite some time. They have daily specials on beer and food up on their chalkboard. Our service was great and the food was served so hot we had to wait a minute to eat it. We started with fried pickles, which had a nice flavor but maybe could be thicker? I ordered the fried chicken (it came with three pieces) and mac and cheese with baked beans. My boyfriend ordered the pulled pork sandwich and fried okra. I really liked the smoke flavor of the pork."
3,"For a quick wash that is cheap not bad at all.  They have free vacuums too.  You stay in your vehicle  during the wash and there is a guy at the end who wipes down your car.  They do a good job.  This is the perfect place to take the car after it gets caught in a monsoon rain.  They don't offer the full detail and they don't do the inside.  They also don't give you a little towel anymore to wipe the inside.  But like I said, it is perfect for a quick wash to tide you over for awhile."
3,"First of all we are so glad that you didn't go out of business, however had If i had not owned a computer and was nosey enough to search you out we would not have known where you moved too.\n\nWith that said same great food, people are very friendly,  prices, well, I had a HALF turkey sandwich, with the Mac salad, and hubby had pastrami with potato salad.  We both had water, and the check was $20 before tip.  For lunch, in this area that is still a bit pricey.  \n\nWe would come more often or order dessert if the prices where lower,"
3,"First time to try Poutine and while it was ok definitely had better in other places later on during my trip. We had a super friendly server and loved the back yard location - really interesting stuff to admire on the walls, they have definitely upgraded their backyard since the photos were taken. \n\nYes, the establishment is on the tourist trail and would not be highly rated compared to the huge amount of fine establishments in Montreal. \n\nSave yourself ordering the coffee. I think the instant fares better. Stick with the beers.\n\nIn fairness, we didn't get to try other items on the menu. Would I go back? Yes, if I was in that area again and needed a snack."
3,"I went to Ruby Tuesday the other day because my 83 year old great aunt took me out to lunch, what was I to say?  She had a coupon of all things.  We all joke about my father's side of the family being tight with money.  Too funny, she had a stack of coupons.  I always get the same thing when I go, really that is my secret to chain restaurants, just stick with a burger or chicken sandwich.   Who cares if they chicken arrives on a truck with grill marks?  \n\nRuby Tuesday has 2 mini burgers with salad bar for $8.  That is a no brainer.  And they just added pimento cheese option  to the burgers, this makes me happy.\n\nTwo things I miss from the good ole days, on the salad bar- they used to have bread and butter pickles and pineapple.  Whhyyyyy? in my most dramatic voice."
3,"We have 4 kids. We easily spent 200 dollars and 2 hours in this store. Its fantastic. Its crowded but its a tourist black hole, so what do you expect?\n\nWe don't bring the kids to Vegas, but we bring them a lot of gifts every trip. \n\nThis store is several stories and if your kids like M&Ms you will find something here that your kids will just DIE to have!\n\nAs a matter of foact my daughter requested that I get her something this year when we go in January, so we will be visiting this place again on out upcoming trip.\n\nThe staff was nice/helpful lines were kind of long, everything was just a bit more than we wanted to spend but it was on the strip and part of what you pay for is the experience and the location, it is very convenient for the casual strip walk to end up in stores like this. That's why these store are where they are.\n\nTo be honest, in the end, if I didn't have kids this place wouldn't be nearly as enticing as it was, nor would I have had the patience to manuver my way through the throngs of small children weaving all over the place. \n\nAlso, its a little hard to navigate your way around... We didn't mind, it was just confusing, not intuative."
3,Casual pizza and pasta place. Order at the counter and they bring the food to you. Great deal for the dinner entrees - about $9 for spaghetti and meatballs with a side salad and garlic bread. Nothing fancy - just simple but service has two thumbs up. Bathrooms and overall establishment are clean and spacey. My grips are that it is $1 for a refill and cash only.
3,"I have been wanting to try this Farmers Market out for a long time. When i go to the Downtown Market the veggies are already picked over...\nAny-who , so having the day off I decide to venture over, the sign says opens at 10, but when we pull up at 9:45  all the Granola Types are already  elbows deep in produce.. hope i didn't miss anything. \nMcClendons provides the bulk of the Produce and it looks really pretty, bright purple red beets, deep green leeks, fingerling potatoes  , shallots , farm fresh broccoli ,,yummy!   Much of the produce is organic and labeled to its origins , several items were from Willcox so mucho fresh. \n\nMcClendons has 5 registers open and there still is a line . Housewives are grabbing and picking veggies quick , you have to be quick on your toes not to be ran over .But it was worth it. \n\nAfter Veggies its mostly crafty stuff , soap, blankets(?), jewelry, yarn crafts, a bread stand.   So   not a whole lot.\n\nWould I go again , if I was in the area I definitely would want  to get fresh veggies. But I  wouldn't make much effort and I am usually at work . if you live close and are at home Wed. morning  yeah get over there and grab."
3,"Chipotle is my favorite restaurant because Chipotle IS LIFE! My rating is not based off the food because Chipotle food is always great and always deserves a 5 star. My rating is specifically based off of the service and speed. \nLet me say that the workers there were very nice. They were nice, but you could tell they were flustered and nervous. \nThere was like 3 people in line and they seemed overwhelmed (this is compared to others who do fine with lines out the doors). \nThe gentleman in front of me started his order and the lady behind the counter left his food sitting there. When she came back, she threw away what she started (since it was cold) and made him a new one. \nTotal time took about 15 min to order and everything, so it was a lot slower than most chipotle. \nFood was great like always. \nHopefully once they get used to working it will speed up!"
3,I hadn't been here for awhile but happy that I went back. Very good service. Steak and grilled shrimp were very good and cooked perfectly. The salad bar is well stocked and fresh. Topped off with make your own strawberry shortcake and it was well worth the trip.
3,"Though the crowd can't really be categorized, this place has plenty of seating and a quick staff. The inside bar is newly renovated, but like most bars the atmosphere completely depends on the time of day - and day of the week.\n\nOn slower days, bartenders are even more friendly than usual, and definitely want to help rid you of your hangover."
3,"After reading other reviews about this place, I knew not to expect it to be a military surplus store, but I was still disappointed. Mind you, it was a really cool zombie-themed souvenir shop that had a small armory in the back, but there really wasn't much truly practical \""survival\"" gear.\n\nIf you like zombies, this is a really fun place to go. I imagine that kids would love it! There are several interactive game thingies there, lots of T shirts, some books and bumper stickers. \n\nThe MREs are a little pricy, as are the other camping/survival items (think rain ponchos and hand crank radios and flash lights). The only thing that I left with was a Twinkie. \n\nAll in all, this is a fun themed shop with very friendly staff."
3,"The service was outstanding. Everyone on staff was pleasant and helpful. Not the most kid-friendly (no cups with lids). The stuffed mushrooms were tasty, but only slightly warm to cool. The eggplant  and veal parm were tasty, but I think overpriced for what you get. It feels like a restaurant that can't decide whether to be casual or fine. Linen napkins (with paper napkin centerpieces) and oil lamps, but tissue paper plate liners. Might go again without the kids. The patio looked nice for alfresco dining."
3,"I went there for happy hour and there was no one there at 5pm. More people started arriving but it was pretty slow. Drinks during happy hr are about 5-6 bucks for sangrias, wine and martinis. The food is pretty tasty, i would recommend to have the sample platter. you actually get a lot of food for an appetizer."
3,"We went for pie.  The apple pie was good as far as the filling went--nice and spicy.  But the crust was so big it wasnt cooked thru, I didnt eat it.  The portion--enough for three people--not a good thing for me, but some might like it.  The key lime was good and a bigger portion than other places serve.  Overall, not the best pie ever, the quest continues for great pie.  \nService was slow, waitress was nice."
3,"After all our friends had told us to try out Texaz, we finally did. We both ordered, and it wasn't bad! What they forgot to mention to us was that they all had the chicken fried steaks and LOVED them. Guess we'll have to get that next time. Very friendly staff."
3,"Alright so I've been here before, usually the food is actually pretty decent. But the service was pretty lackluster. Like I have no complaints about the food, but  we asked for water at the beginning of meal we finally got the waters after asking 3 times. you shouldn't have to ask for water more than once. Especially did you ask water right when you make your order."
3,"Food and service great!  Price was a hidden charge, but at least they tell you when you pay before you sit down to eat.  It's a $5.99 all you can eat breakfast, but if you don't have their \""player's card\"" program, they add $3/person."
3,nice place. one thing i really didn't like is smoke. i couldn't be there more then hour. too much smoke almost everybody smoke. dj was the lady she is so cool i like her a lot. this place is different then lot of place. people say woman free but they charged 10$ each woman. if next time i would go XS
3,The service was good but I got the 'pollo poblano' entree and it was so not appetizing. The rice and bean stuff was fine but ugh I am never getting that again. They gave us some chips and salsa. The salsa was too liquidy. It sort of seems like as thought they added much more water into it. The dessert thing that they just gave us was interesting. So technically got an appetizer an dessert for free and they give you more so that's nice
3,"This store is fine if you only need to pick up a few items.  This is not a Super-ShurSave. They don't have aisles that endlessly go on and on.\n\nThe only complaint that I have is their produce section.\n\nI am very very picky about produces freshness.  I am a bargain shopper, but will go to Giant Eagle Market District a\nfor my fruits and vegetables and that is where I will pay extra."
3,"I love the Venetian!  The painted walls and ceilings, the street performers...a little piece of Venice.  So naturally having lunch in this open space restaurant sounded like a terrific idea.  \nThe 20 minute wait was no problem, there are multiple restaurants around so we had a glass of wine at a neighboring bar.  Once seated we ordered our drinks, since I'm from Miami, whenever I order a caipirinha i take into consideration that not everybody understand what its suppose to taste like.  Unfortunately it was so awful that both me and my friend had to send our drinks back.  Then when our waiter kindly recommended the pomegranate mojitos, i nervously accepted.  Also terrible but I was not about to return two cocktails.  \n\nSo now for the food; boring.  Maybe I'm being bias because of my superb experience with the Wolfgang Puck Bar and Grill @ the MGM but the food was nothing special.  I was expecting a savory pasta dish and what i served was can only be described as ordinary.  \n\nVery disappointing, you have all the right components, step up your game Postrio!!"
3,"Very eclectic interior.  Friendly staff.  Food is small plates.  Drinks are strong with house - made syrups.  Good place to meet friends early in the night, but keep an eye on your tab or you might be broke before 10p;)  They will likely be a 4-5 star establishment with time"
3,"I had breakfast here this morning with a friend before we did a little grocery shopping at Whole Foods. \n\nIt was my first time here, but my friend eats here all the time.  It's one of her favorite restaurants.  \n\nI went with the garden omlette and apple cinnamon toast.  It was good and definitely tasted healthy.  Heather had the oatmeal with brulee topping and fresh berries.  I tried hers, it was pretty good too.  Everything was good, but not spectacular. \n\nThere is lots of seating and the service was fast.  I wasn't wow'd by anything.  I will definitely try this place again.  I hear the sweet potato fries are excellent."
3,"Pretty good place.  Beware of fancy control panel to turn on and off lights, open blinds, etc.  if you are not high tech it could be a problem.\n\nLike other places they try to \""convenience\"" you by not providing a coffee maker in your room. They want you to go all the way to the casino to get a cup of coffee.  Since we stayed there four days we decided to buy a machine and left it for the housekeeping staff."
3,"Been to Tao a few times now. I loved it the first time, but after coming back again, think differently about it.\n\nFirst off, this is one of those clubs that will screw guys over if you don't have at least a 50-50 ratio. I came here with a group of 4 guys and they basically told us if we don't buy a table, we're not getting in. The doorman wouldn't even let us wait in line! Luckily, we had made friends with another doorman earlier that night and he let us in no problem.\n\nAfter you get in, the place is really cool for the first 15 minutes, until the rest of the crown starts filling in the place. Once the place gets packed, there's no where to move, no where to stand, no where to dance. I don't get how this isn't a fire hazard. I must say the decor is awesome and the bathing girls is a nice touch. The bartenders are always awesome here too. But the doormen and bouncers suck and the place is hard to move around. However, everyone should visit this place at least once."
3,"Well, it's a good place to take the kids. It's not that entertaining for the adults... unless you're a big fan of penguins. It's not a very impressive zoo, the only thing that's interesting in my opinion is the recreation of the habitats of the animals."
3,"Pretty average mexican food.  The portion sizes are big for the price, but the taste is just okay.  I'll give them another shot because they are so close to where I live, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."
3,Great food when they have it. They seem to run out of goat cheese curds a lot. \nDon't go on trivia night or you won't get good service. They act like you're an inconvenience when you want to eat before trivia starts.
3,"Flying in from Orlando was great. We landed an hour early, took the airport tram over to the baggage area, then out to the taxis and away we went. \n\nLeaving Vegas wasn't as easy. Southwest's curbside skycaps and check-in  were great. However, one person in our party had bought two very small Vegas souvenir snow globes. TSA wouldn't let him through with them. They escorted him back out so he could go to the post office on the other end of the airport to mail them home instead.\n\nOur flight was at Gate C1, so we thought that it would be nearby. Wrong. You have to walk (no people movers; no tram like you had when you arrived) at least 100 yards before you get to the first gates that start at number 25 or so. Gate C1 is the LAST gate rather than the first one. Eventually, you have to walk around that nice tram that carried you in upon arrival, then keep walking and keep walking and keep walking until you reach the crammed up gate where it's standing room only and decorated like a 1980's prison cafeteria.\n\nObviously, they love to get you in, but never want you to leave."
3,Breakfast is very good especially the Skillets and since they put misters outside on the patio breakfast outside is superb.
3,"Been coming here for years, figured that it was time for a review of the buffet.\n\nLet's cut to the chase: The food is average. Nothing too exceedingly fancy, but better than mystery meat swimming in gravy. Breakfast offerings usually include waffles, french toast, made-to-order omelettes, and various styles of breakfast meats and potatoes. Lunch and dinner are pretty much the same, with basic fried seafood, pizza, chinese food (which is pretty tasty), with some nights offering crab legs and steaks for a slightly higher price.\n\nThe wait staff is generally nice and attentive.\n\nThe price really can't be beat. As long as you have a player's card, breakfast lunch and dinner are 6-9-12 dollars, respectively. Compared to other buffet offerings, I'm not sure where else you can get a decent breakfast or lunch for under $10.\n\nIn review: It's inexpensive, it's basic."
3,"Decent food, they use real meat for their sandwiches (and not the Spam-looking meat of sorts), the salads are very good and always fresh..HOWEVER, they should train their females employees (who are clearly from the Middle East) to interact with male customers. Here in the West men and women do interact during business transactions held in public, in restaurants, supermarkets, shoe stores pharmacies, etc , if those female employees do not like doing that then they should not work behind a counter, because half of the customers will be men (problably some transexual customer will come, but it would difficult to find out and even more impolite to ask). So if Basha owners want to offer good customer service they should train their females employees according to the social mores of Canada (they are here anyway) . I have eaten twice at Basha, the first time in the Ste Catherine/Peel  location, the food was very good but the woman behind the counter behaved as if she hated her job or did not want to serve a male customer...then I ate at the food court on Place Mont Royal, the bald guy, who I suspect owns the franchise was friendly...the woman (probably his wife) reacted as though I had leprosy at the moment of giving me the change...if shes so disgusted with the presence of male customers she should be in the kitchen...problem solved."
3,"I came here for take out recently and upon entering the restaurant my eyes burst from the bright floral patterned seat covers. They were a bit of an eyesore. As for the rest of the restaurant, it was cutely arranged with round tables and red Chinese lanterns lining the ceilings. They were playing old school Christmas songs which got me in a cheery mood whilst waiting.\n\nI ordered the soup dumplings and the fried string beans. I was hoping for them to be big portions for the amount I paid, which was $20 for two dishes. \n\nSo the verdict: \nThe dumplings were ok and hardened as soon as they started to cool down. The green beans were seasoned nicely and was a good portion but the down side was how greasy they were. \n\nI'm willing to give this place another shot I didn't really love what I had."
3,"The waitress Monica was verify friendly and attentive.  The burger was pretty good but nothing really noteworthy.  She gladly took my lunch coupon (got to watch those pennies now days) and when I thought the total was missing the deduction for the coupon she pointed out to it without making me feel stupid for missing it.  It took a bit to get the burger, but with her friendly service, I would be willing to stop in a again during my work lunch.  The restaurant was clean, they could have turned down the country music drawl a bit, but I think its part of their culture."
3,Been here a couple times and this place is a hit or miss at times. Even though they remodeled the place a few years back..it still have that cafeteria feel to it. The selection is okay not great it depends on the day. Went there a couple months back and it wasn't all that great to remember...but just went back last week because George Michael was playing at the MGM and we decided to give the buffet another try and it turned out okay. They actually have the steak station open this time and when you walk into the buffet the smell of the grilled steak just makes your mouth water and it turn out pretty tasty. The crab legs were tasty and delicious that night as well. But they had a special event price that night which cost an addtional $10 more per person...for $30 some dollars we should of planned for more time and went to the Wynn.
3,"After moving from Chicago, it was a must to find good sushi restaurant in Madison.  I was a little skeptical at first with it being in a strip mall next to a dollar store.  This place indeed went beyond my initial expectations.  I have been going to Takara for the last year and half and although I feel it has lacked a little since discovering it, I would still recommend this establishment.  They have a awesome lunch special as well, 2 rolls and miso soup for low cost."
3,They have a wide variety of sweets. Although they are crazy expensive. The staff was not that friendly. The gelato is delicious.
3,"I was tempted to give Goodtimes 2 stars but since I'm from out of town and have only been here once, i can't vouch for it's consistency.\n\nWe stopped by Goodtimes on a Thursday night for their Goth night \""Carpe Noctem\"". I could tell we atleast reached the right place based on a few spooky kids in the parking lot and a hearse parked out there too.\n\nThe dance floor area was pleasently full. All tables/seatting area around it were taken so we headed back to the EMPTY bar area.  The bartender was quick, curtious, and poured nicely.\n\nAfter I got a good buzz on I went out to dance and realized there wasn't enough space. Their dance floor is made out some strange/slick metal plates. I didn't feel sturdy enough to really cutloose. \n\nYou really can't judge a goth club based on once experience. This lifestyle is a scene and not something one can jump into. It made me remember how long it took for me to feel welcome at the club back at home so i won't make quick judgements here.\n\nI suppose since the goth scene is a slowly dying thing (ahhh, pun), you take what you can get in Vegas."
3,"The son and I tried Elmer's last night for the first time.  Figured he could see what the place is about so he knows where he can dash to for lunch from CHS.\n\nHe got the Asada burrito which he said tasted good.   I got the green beef hot burrito.  It was tasty, but very messy.  I had to grab a fork and knife to finish.\n\nThey have a pretty decent sized menu.  Prices are dirt cheap.   Hands down they beat Guedo's because they offer chips and salsa and take debit cards.  Food, prices and counter help is better at Elmer's too.\n\nNot the cleanest of places.  Definite hole in the wall.  The smooshed food on the floor by our table kinda got to me."
3,"Got to try this place for Apps one night, after our conference. I got the last bowl of clam chowder available..it was disappointing as virtually no seasoning.  The calamari was ok as it was lightly breaded and I personally prefer that, the aioli was good.\nThe pizzas were pretty good, and the shrimp cocktail was good.  Service was descent"
3,Met a friend for breakfast here. Service was good. It is an Eat n Park / Denny's type of place so if you enjoy those kinds of places you will love Drew's.. I ordered the farmers omelette and my friend had the Corned Beef Hash and eggs. The big plate full of CBH was made from scratch and not canned. Delicious per my friend. My omelette was ok... Because it was the farmers and had some potatoes in it I did not receive any hash browns just a couple of slices of small toast. A great place would have included some fresh fruit to fill the platter but not Drew's just a small burrito sized omelette in the middle of a big platter..
3,"Everyone was raving about the oxtail chili cheese fries but it just tasted like a regular chili cheese fries with an egg on top. Nothing extravagant. But the fries itself was pretty good. \n\nI originally ordered the Kiki's burger and my husband ordered the Miyagi Wagyu burger but then I totally changed my mind so we switched burgers. I personally like the Miyagi burger better. It reminded me of the Manly burger at Umami burger. And my husband says he liked the Kiki's burger better so I guess it all worked out. \n\nI'm giving it a 3 stars because their food is really yummy but it's also expensive. Also this is the first place in Vegas that has decent boba. I've searched long and hard for boba places that can give me almost the same thing I had in California and this place came pretty close. The only problem is, like I said, it's expensive. And such small portions. But I mean overall I'd still eat here again."
3,I said I would re review this place... I would recommend this place! The food was delicious but it's not an inexpensive lunch
3,"Cheap food, cheap quality, hit and miss service.\n\nWho I'd Take Here: Large groups of friends and family.\nComparable to: Paradise Buffet, any other buffet in Freemont.\nNotes: A wall of the bathroom (the casino bathroom nearest to this location) is ostensibly a part of the Berlin wall.\n\nFood Quality: 4\nSunday brunch at this location is only $12 with the club card. This is an excellent price. I've been here twice, and the food is pretty much on par with what you paid for (OK). The prime rib is OK, but avoid the brisket because they cut it at the wrong angle (chewy) and it needed a few more hours in the slow cooker. Note that the bar near the restaurant will serve you beer in the $1 range for a cup.\n+1 price.\n\nService Quality: 2 \nThe service here is pretty hit and miss. When it hit, it was pretty good. When it missed, we went our entire meal without drink refills. That time, we saw our waiter twice. \n-1 bad service.\n\nLocation, Cleanliness and Ambiance: 3\nThe decorations on the ceiling remind me of Bioshock Infinity. Otherwise, its pretty generic. Like the service, the cleanliness is hit or miss. This is located in the Main Street Station casino, which itself is located at the end of the Freemont Street Experience.\n\nHow I rate: I have 3 categories, and each category starts at 3 points. For each item where I am impressed, they get 1 point; disappointed, lose one point.\n\nOverall rating: round(average(ratings)) = 3"
3,"Pretty good neighborhood coffee spot. \nThe girls that work here are always super friendly, coffee is good, not the best I have ever had, but I prefer it over Starbucks. I love the Kona brew, always get excited when I come in and see it on the board.\nMy biggest complaint is I wish they served b'fast sandwiches. They always have some pastry's made at local spots, and bagels. But I want a bacon, egg, & cheese with my coffee.\n Also careful what time you go if you decide to visit on a Sunday morning, it gets crazy in there with all the people who attend the church at the theatre. It becomes a mass of people who know each other just standing  in the middle of an already cramped coffee shop, just talking."
3,"I've been going here for over 4 years.  We've done comedy in just about every room.\nI still have trouble understanding WHY the bathrooms are so...destroyed!  Some of the doors are off their hinges, there is never enough hand soap or paper towels.\nOn the flip side, though, there is something to do for everyone.  Pool, air hockey, ping pong, music and the outdoor atrium.\nStaff is very friendly"
3,"It's hard not to love anything on gorgeous William Street, but for some reason I didn't get too excited about The Melville when I came here the other day. It just seemed a bit too olde worlde, in a bad way, for my liking. Whether it was the three gents of a certain age smoking in the doorway, or the smell when I walked in that made me think for a second that the smoking ban had never been implemented.\n\nDrinks were pricey compared to a lot of other pubs in this area of the city centre, and although it was no more expensive than Teuchters just across the road it lacks the same relaxed and trendy vibe that Teuchters has. Although in its defense, the food menu did look nice and inviting as well as being good value for money, so I'll probably head back here at some point to try it out. It's just not at the top of my list."
3,I had came to lake las vegas when i first met my fiancee but had never eaten anywhere in the village. I chose this place for our 1 year anniversary because it had a patio right next to the Marina with a great lake view. The patio was really dirty and the seats were covered with bird feces. The food was really delicious. I had gotten steak and it was cooked very well but still juicy. Service was good but our waitress was gone most of the time. And cocktails were horrible. Only the food was a major plus. Oh and we had to find the waitress to pay for the check
3,"I was pleasantly surprised by this French bistro. Most of the restaurants on Prince-Arthur are overpriced tourist traps. However, Les Deux Gamins was fairly reasonably priced. Keep in mind tho that it is not a BYOW place like a lot of the other restaurants nearby.\n\nAs for the food, fairly standard French fares: steak tartare, steak frite, lamb shank etc. No surprises or modern twists but this is sometimes what I'm looking for.\n\nThe kitchen lost our ticket for our appetizers. However they made it up with a full bottle of house wine. In all, there are better French Restaurants in Montreal. However, you could do a whole lot worse than eat here"
3,"I'm from S. Cali where the Sushi options are plentiful. Moving to AZ I've been in desperate need of finding a local sushi spot that would be at least semi-comparable to the quality we get back in LA and at reasonable price-points. Taking in to consideration that the fish might be fresher and not previously frozen because LA has its harbors, I went to Hiro's with lower expectations so I wouldn't be disappointed. Overall, the ambiance and the sushi quality is pretty good for being in AZ. However, the prices are a bit high as to be expected being that it is located in Scottsdale and that the rent and getting quality fish so far inland from the coast would raise cost. The portions could be larger to justify the higher prices. Moreover, I don't understand WHY the bento boxes (i.e. Teriyaki Chicken & Mixed Tempura) is priced so high! For that reason, I probably won't be returning here, especially if I want non-fish options. That kind of stuff shouldn't be priced so high because it's produced locally. I would understand if it were Kobe beef or something.. but chicken? And to add insult to injury, the chicken that I received that night was a bit on the dry side. Not sure if it was an isolated incident but for the high price I expect quality or even naturally raised organic style chicken...now we're talking! Anyway, now I feel cheated in that respect. Sorry Hiro, on to the next spot!"
3,"These guys are very personable. The first time I called them it was with a simple electrical job. They fit me into their schedule the same day. Ultimately, they were not able to fix the problem, but rather than make matters worse, they simply stated that they couldn't figure it out and that I should call and electrician, which I did. The electrician fixed the problem in 5 minutes.  That said, I've got an appointment scheduled for another job. This time I couldn't get on their schedule for two weeks. The price they quoted me for this job was a fraction of what other contractors were charging."
3,The food was decent so they lose a star there.  We tried the chicken which had good flavor but was a bit dry.  The BBQ sandwich was much the same.  The ribs were killer though.  And the insane amount of side they have is awesome.  All 4 sides we tried were really tasty.\n\nThey lose another star because we sat and watched person after person that ordered after us get their togo orders before they even bothered to tell us they messed up on our order.  Their saving grace was the gentleman that work the register there telling us he was sorry and gave us a free dish.\n\nI will try this place again hoping it was a fluke.
3,"My husband and I went for an early dinner, sat outside on the patio....  nice, but unfortunately the road noise was a bit distracting from the ambiance.  Inside was stuffy and very noisy, so outside was a better choice,\nThe flat bread and garlic balls bread basket was good, served warm.\nNow the main course, my husband ordered linguini and clams... When it came, he honestly said \""we need to go to McDonald's\"". The portion was incredibly small.... We counted 7 small, super tiny clams.... and maybe a half cup of linguini.\nI ordered the chicken marsala, it was a good size portion, huge compared to the linguini, flavorful and tastefully done.  I shared my food with my husband and skipped McDonald's.  \nService was super slow....\nNot sure we would go back with do many other places to try."
3,"Sub par sushi. \n\nRa was the first place I had ever tried sushi and I really enjoyed it. However, after broadening my horizons and dining at other sushi establishments (Hiro, etc.), I discovered that there are much better options all over the valley. \n\nIf you go, I would recommend the Las Vegas roll (not sure what's in it) and calamari roll (fried calamari, cream cheese, white rice, and topped with eel sauce and tempura flakes). Both are decent and are much better tasting than their other rolls.\n\nThey have good happy hour deals. Rolls are definitely much smaller here than anywhere else I've been."
3,***This Urban Outfitters (located on the second floor of Mandalay Place) seems very similar to all the other Urban Outfitters locations out there--good selection of casual clothes and quite a few funny gag gifts/books located at the front of the store***\n\nMandalay Place shares a free parking structure with Mandalay Bay (self-parking).
3,Decent Chinese fast food that is similar to Panda Express.  About what you would expect at a food court.  \n\nThe prices for the food entrees was a bit high.  The price for a bottle of beer was way too expensive.  Just get your alcohol at the casino while playing.\n\nGood place for a quick meal.  I would stop by again.  I just would not buy beer.
3,"So I haven't been to a $.99 store in a while.  And I forgot about all the great deals they do have.  Times are tight for just about everyone and a good bargain is sometimes hard to find if you don't look in the right place.  So if you haven't already started looking here every once in a while you might want to start!  They have just about everything here, from plates and dishware to canned food. There is usually one thing you will find even if you aren't really looking.  So the next time you get a chance you might want to take a stroll through and see what you find."
3,"I think their food is pretty good BUT it never fails Every time I order the pear salad it's always missing something! It's like the waitress isn't listening. Or I order wings and I ask for blue cheese and always get ranch! It's little things like this that makes the experience and the prices I pay irritating. I want to get what I pay for. I don't want to get home with my take out and dip a wing and discover its in a dressing I hate or that my salad is all together wrong! BUT they are always very accommodating and fix their error and compensate me for it, but it happens all too often."
3,"What a hidden treasure.  Tucked away in corner strip center at 19th Ave. and TBird next to high school we found a new sushi and japanese restaurant.  Very small but comfy.  Booths, tables and sushi bar.  Looks like it's run by the owners - an old couple.  We ordered the bento box specials for lunch today.  $6.95 = choice of soup + egg roll + tempura veggies, + 1/2 a California roll, + white rice and a choice of several entrees.  Bro picked General Tao Chicken.  I picked Mongolian Beef.  Both were great.  We'll be back for bento boxes and to try the real sushi and sashimi.  Spread the word - they need business."
3,"The store is very clean, and looks a lot newer and bigger on the inside than it does on the outside. I got my order to go, which was chicken noodle in a bread bowl. The bread bowl was cold when I took it out of the bag, and I had to microwave it for a few seconds. The soup tasted amazing but the bread was pretty bland and got soggy VERY fast. Basically the bread bowl was just a dinner roll with a hole punched in the middle of it. I read someone else's review about the man scratching his behind and then returning to making the sandwiches and also thought that was pretty gross. I have to commend them for having the coke soda machine with over 100 flavors, though. I will probably just eat somewhere else next time, but it wasn't too bad of an experience."
3,"Still good food like before the fire, but the salads seem smaller. The new modern style totally ruined the comfortable atmosphere."
3,"Trusty old Beanscene. Academic year after academic year this has been my favourite place to grab a large mug of Americano, pick up a copy of the Metro and slip into one of its leather booths for a quiet read and a flick through my lecture notes.\n\nInviting staff, mellow beats playing in the background and a more personal alternative to the bigger corporate cafe brands result in a pleasant and reliable service that will keep coming back for more.\n\nAdmittedly, I've never come here for the food: Nachos, Paninis etc are the typical fare. But for a coffee and a place to sit and read, Beanscene will do just fine."
3,"Of all the gay bars in the city, 941 probably ranks in the middle of them all. There's really nothing awful about it and yet there really isn't anything amazing about it either. And to be honest, you wouldn't even know it's a gay bar unless you've researched it. \n\n\nHaving said all this, it really depends on the time you go. I visited here this previous weekend in the afternoon. There were only a few people there which made the atmosphere comfortable. I got a Mai Tai (sp?) that was on special for $4.75 and it came in a bigger glass. The bartender was also very pleasant. Great experience!\n\nNow let's rewind a little bit. A few months ago I came here with my boyfriend on a Friday night. The crowd was weird. It was the most unusual mix of people. Not saying it's a bad thing, but some of the characters were very... \""Downtown,\"" ...you know what I'm saying. Not too mention that the prices were a bit much for beer. I also remember ordering a cranberry vodka and it came in this small glass, probably only holding 1/4 of the liquid that was in my drink this weekend. It's very touch and go here so just be prepared."
3,"I've wanted to try this place for a long time now, every time I go to Vegas I see it and the building draws me towards it. Finally got to try it during my last trip out there. \nThe wait was ridiculous for inside seating (2 hours +) so we decided to grab some food inside of the Ceasar's food court then later go back to their outside window to order some frozen hot chocolates. \nThe line was pretty long still for the outside and we figured out why when we got up to the window FINALLY.. the guy who was working was all by himself struggling to juggle everything all at once, poor guy.\nWe had 7 girls so we shared two large frozen hot chocolates which are made for two people but it was just enough, just get extra straws if you're going to do so. It was really good but truthfully tasted like a typical chocolate milkshake but more chocolate flavorings which was good, I also actually liked the grittiness from the mixture.\nIt was good to try but not worth the $8.00"
3,"Tasty tacos in a slightly too-cute interior.  While the tacos were tasty (I tried three of the meat variety), I thought the rice and beans were a little bland.\r\n\r\nI'll head back but if I'm craving Mexican, there are better options."
3,"Decent breakfast place but a bit expensive. You get better value at Cora and you get better food at Cafe Orange. Still, if you're in the area and want to eat, it's not a bad choice."
3,"I go to Outback because you know what you are going to get. The food is good, place is clean, service is average or better. This location meets all of the above.\n2 of us went at 5pm for dinner beating the crowds."
3,There has been an improvement from when this was Terrible Herbst. The food is better and the service is slightly faster than before. The $10 specials are still a good value. I have always liked the Cafe over the Buffet even when the buffet was comped. The one remaining problem is that this is where old waitresses go to die. Slow and often need ing to ask two or three times for condiments or set ups for additional people.
3,"Pretty standard theatre, never had a bad experience here, except sometimes it can be crowded, and of course its expensive. Except matinee = $5!"
3,I just hate the lines at Walmart and it takes for ever to get in and out of this place. Need to open up more registers.
3,"I was expecting a lot more from this high end chocolate shop but all I got was a Sephora-like atmosphere without the black gloves. Very interesting combination of chocolates as many reviewers have noted but there's just not a single flavor I'd buy in bulk and I sampled 5 different flavors. They tossed in a couple freebies and there was some tortilla chips dipped in chocolate sprinkled in Cayenne pepper. Again, interesting combos but not yummy."
3,"I had such high hopes for this place since my coworkers talked it up so much. The carne asada tacos were bomb. Shrimp tacos were meh, I wish I would've ordered more carne asada instead of the shrimp. Service was very slow it took like 15 minutes to get my beer and they're always out if Dos Equis (according to my coworkers). We had a group of 8 so we had a decent sized table. Almost every order was messed up and only two checks came out right. It took her 20 minutes to correct the issue. The guy bringing out the food was getting frustrated because nothing was right they were clearly upset with us because we kept telling them \""This is the wrong order.\"" Or \""We're missing a taco from this order.\"" But hey we're paying for our stuff so I think our orders should be correct. I'll probably try this place one more time before I give up on it. Hopefully I'll have an updated review soon! Oh and I don't recommend the frozen margaritas $7 for a small super weak drink it's good for light weight ;)"
3,Do you work at Bally's?  Look at your physique...  This place is a nice place to relax and drinks are cheap.  It's just not that big of a pool.
3,"Good food. Good drinks. Too bad there's always a long wait for fish on Friday. Their fish and chips are both very good, either fried or broiled. Love their fried mushrooms!"
3,"Tiny Mexican hole in the wall I found while looking for a different restaurant. The menu is brief - ten items.  When I was there, it was one bearded not very Mexican guy taking the orders and making the food. Every table has its own selection of hot sauces and little pots of seasonings.  I'm incredibly curious about this little restaurant. The decor is a mix of tiki hut, Mexican flags, Frida Kahlo art, paper lanterns, random movie posters and laminated pictures from the menu. They also have a selection of Mexican candies and beverages.\n\nI had the enchiladas with mole sauce and they were good - I'm no mole expert but in my limited experience I felt that the sauce was a good example of Mole.  The kitchen is very tiny and I'm thinking that most everything they serve is reheated in a microwave but I also realize that this is probably the case in many situations where the kitchen is not visible.  \n\nAll in all a neat little experience and I would go again."
3,"Service was great but drinks and prices were horrible.  Mojito and margarita were served in plastic cups with more ice than drink, paid eleven each for lunch time.  Nachos were great but wasn't exactly how we ordered.  Probably wouldn't come to this one again..I'll stick with the locations I know and trust."
3,"Two days  and two trips to the spinning meat sticks of happiness.  \n\nI have to say that I'd already ordered the dolmas  when I sat down to read the reviews and sadly Valerie's take on them isn't too far  from the truth.\n\n  Dolmas seem like pakora , within Indian restaurants, in that they nearly all have them ( except  for the insane places that have them only at weekends) but you never quite know what you're going to get.   What I got looked the part,  but  apart  from the citrus smell it was hard to pull any  real taste  out of them.   Out of the 8   5.5  were left.   So  now I'm getting a bit  worried about what's coming out next   but thankfully I didn't need to worry. \n\nThe gyro salad was large,  fresh and the  meat was plentiful.  The pita bread  decent and the accompanying sauces within expectations. My partner had the Gryo pita basket and the  damn thing was also good,  decent fries served with it too.    \n\nI'm certainly going back based on the strength of the entrees and  without the dolmas  would have been a four"
3,"Watched a lot of shows, this one was well below average. Lot of mistakes in the co-ordination among performers spoiled all the fun, add to it the rude staff. One of the performer announced at the beginning of the show that flash photography is not allowed, after which people turned off the flash to take snaps, only to find a rude old lady coming up and almost getting physical with them and snatching their cameras- saying photography is not allowed at all. They need to be specific in giving the instruction. No one wants to take a snap of their mediocre show if they are not allowed to, but for God's sake save them the humiliation by telling them. Gamble and lose your money than to watch this show!! \nOverall Average Performance, Poor staff, overrated"
3,"I normally love the ambience of this place and the beautiful layout of the bar.  Food is OK, but the fried bologna sandwich is excellent.  Didn't give it 5 stars because I went in there last Saturday over Memorial Day weekend, sat at the bar, and ordered a glass of white wine to go with my lunch.  The bar didn't have ANY white wine - no chardonnay, no sauvignon blanc, no pinot grigio - nothing.  What kind of bar doesn't have white wine on a holiday weekend?  They need to do some inventory control.  No wonder the place was deserted."
3,"Had the fried chicken salad. Wish they would add a grilled chicken salad. Trying to make good choices with my dining, and fried chicken strips on a salad is counter productive. Waitress/bartender was on the spot.\n\nIf you go between 4 - 6 don't sit facing the window, the Sun blinds you like a Gamma Ray. I asked the bartender if she could shut the blind as the sun was reflecting off a wind shield and boring a hole in my face, I pointed at the window.  She proceeded to shut all blinds but the one that had the super nova coming through."
3,"Regular sports bar with a couple of unique amenities.  Large patio on the Scottsdale greenbelt.  Menu where every sandwhich has a corresponding salad version (essentially replace the bread with lettuce).  Lots of specials, and a fun birthday offer.  It's quite large with multiple sections, and televisions all around."
3,Good food but service could have been a bit better. Try the dumplings on the appetizer menu... They are the best! Also the blended margaritas are stiff so watch yourself because before you know it you will be riding a nice buzz!
3,"The place is over rated, the pabellon is not that great. The rice is dry and the prices are too much for the food I get. I was expecting more... Meh!"
3,Pretty good look at the heavy # of people walking around the Casino. staff were nice. Not the cheapest spots for drinks though
3,"its walgreens, 3 stars since its just the same ole thing...hmmm...I wish I could give it 4 stars, maybe if they start selling wine and beer!"
3,"Pretty good, not the best but very far from bad. Haven't been disappointed yet and we eat here about once a week. The Thai basil is really good as well as the steak salad."
3,"So so place.  I guess its nice to have in downtown Gilbert but whoever they have expediting their food orders needs to be fired.  My gf and I were the 4th table sat at Lunch and it still took 40 minutes to get 2 half/half sandwich/salad orders.  40 MINUTES!!!! Are you serious?  Can you imagine going to paradise bakery or wildflower and waiting 40 minutes?  The service is good and the waiters and waitresses kept the drinks full and kept apologizing for the wait.  The food is so-so.  My salad had a million onions, but my gf's was just right.  The panini's were nothing to write home about.  I guess I would go back if a bunch of friends wanted to go and hang out for the wine but I wouldn't go back again for a quick lunch."
3,"Pretty traditional Vegas restaurant.  Nothing over the top here.  The renovation from the previous cafe in the Tropicana is mostly cosmetic but at least you don't walk away feeling the need of a shower.\n\nHas a nice coastal vibe with cool colors and beach-like feel.  Depending on your seating situation, you can have a nice view of the Tropicana pool waterfall.  They have both indoor and outdoor seating.  The staff is friendly and the food tasty.  It's a bit more expensive than the previous cafe but the food is also so much better with good portions."
3,This Dillard's location is just okay. I have purchased a few dresses and tops from this location over the last couple of months and every time I have been in my experience has only been so so. The sales associates in the women's dress department can be either too pushy or completely non existent but not a good balance of one or the other. I have had a little bit of a better experience in the accessories department and the associates in that department seem to be more interested in what you are looking for and how to help rather than just making a sale. I also had an issue recently with needing to return an item that was in perfect condition with tags attached but it had been just a few days over the return policy limit. The manager was able to give me a store credit which I appreciated because I knew I was over the limit of the return policy. Overall this store is just okay. I will be back because I like their selection of dresses and tops but I am still waiting for that wow customer service experience that I think you should get no matter where you are shopping.
3,I think Champions is the only real bar in Gilbert. It's worth a trip for the clientele along - moslyt the Bud Light vs Coors Light crowd. Lots of pool tables plus 6 or so dart boards. This isn't an upscale establishment ... but is a great place to go for a few cheap drinks in a friendly atmosphere.
3,"Falafel was like eating sand.  Yes, real sand.  The outside was overly crispy and it reminded me of beach experiences when sand got in my mouth.\n\nFalafel plate comes with rice, salad, and pita.... yet no hummus or anything substantial to dip the pita into.  Tahini?  No, not that whole pita into a little plastic ramekin of tahini.  Dry, dry, dry and no relief to be found.  \n\nPlease, fellow yelper, stick with the falafel sandwich or other value meal.  No need for dry mouth syndrome at a greek pita place.\n\nAlso it's overpriced.  Falafel plate with soda is just under $12.  If you order hummus to remedy the dry mouth issue then you're bumping up to $16-17 for ONE person."
3,"So-so food but service from the strangest duo of waitresses I've encountered. \""Strange\"" here meaning \""bad\"" and \""off-putting.\""\n\nI'll not be back at this location; the experience was too odd to return."
3,Food was great. Service sucked. I even sat at the bar. The heavyset bartender would not leave his corner. I walked to the sports bar and got a beer before this clown even realized we were here. 6:30 on a Saturday.
3,"As a die-hard Milwaukeean staying at the Wynn, I had to try out the in house Bartolotta's restaurant, considering I didn't know they were a Milwaukee export.\n\nI did not get the full experience at this place mainly because I am not someone that eats seafood (it is flown in fresh from the Mediterranean everyday).  I think that is a little ridiculous, but considering there are no fish in the desert, I don't blame them.\n\nSo, this relegated me to a few pasta dishes and some pancetta.  The pancetta was tough and fatty, but I expected that.  Could have been better though.  The sheep's milk ravioli was delicious, but the spaghetti with ragu could have been better.\n\nOverall, not that impressed for the price,but I didn't eat outside.  That could have made the experience cooler.  The should take Bartolotta's Lake Park Bistro in Milwaukee and stick it in the Wynn, in my humble opinion."
3,Back in June I wrote an unsatisfactory review of this company due to them damaging our gazebo from the fallen palm tree branches. We've come to an agreement and they were nice enough to replace/compensate for the damages it caused. Thank you for that so I'm sure it won't happen again. They have been nice enough to work things out with us no matter what and has shown good customer service regarding the issue. It has been resolved nicely.
3,"I visted Edinburgh on my honeymoon in September. Our first full day of exploring must start with a bountiful breakfast so we had energy to explore all day. We strolled down to the Grassmarket from our hotel on Prince's St. Looking up and down, we chose Cafe Jacques because it had the most customers dining. A good indicator is how busy the place is, right?\n\nWe squeezed in, and I DO mean squeezed because it's tiny, and found a seat. I had a traditional English breakfast and my hubbie the American. The coffee was SO HOT and I made the mistake of trying to gulp my first taste as I tried to caffeinate my jetlagged self. My mouth was scorched for the next two days at least. Although we received a weird look, the waiter brought my husband two tall glasses of milk on request. Is that an American thing to drink milk with breakfast?\n\nAs my three stars indicate, this place was A-OK and got us going on our first full day in Edinburgh."
3,"This is one of my favorite breakfast places, solely because of the AMAZING corned beef hash.  I had to give them just 3 stars, however, because I had HORRIBLE service during my last visit!  I had arrived for a late breakfast at around 2:15pm.  I noticed walking in that the neon Open sign was on, so I walked in.  My boyfriend told me after we had entered that the sign on the door said they were only open until 2.  I asked a server if they were still open and told her that I had just noticed the sign, and the server, Cindy, said she asked the kitchen and her boss and they could accommodate us.  We realized that we had arrived late and were ready to leave, but Cindy assured us it was ok. Cindy was extremely sweet during our whole meal, but what made our visit horribly uncomfortable was another server named Carol, who very loudly and openly bitched about our being seated after 2!!  I couldn't believe it.  Carol was rude and unprofessional and made us feel unwelcome.  The food was amazing and Cindy was great, but Carol's attitude ruined it.   Lady, your boss approved it, so shut up and be happy you have the business!  If it's such a big deal, take initiative to turn off that neon sign at 2pm-- I noticed it was still on when we left at 3."
3,"I've heard so much good stuff for here so we came for lunch on a Friday afternoon on our way to Vegas.  Luckily, there was no line to get in and we go seated near the windows with a view of he strip.  The bad thing was, it was so far away from the food!  :P  No prob though, we needed to get the cardio in.  \n\nWe started in the salad line and made our way through the whole buffet.  I loved the way it was set up.  Lots of action stations and lots of variety.   \n\nHowever, I don't know, I wasn't impressed with the flavors of things.  The best thing I had was the beet salad.  That was really good.  Everything else was just average.  I'm not much of a drinker, but the unlimited beer and wine was cool.  The root beer on tap was really good too. \n\nThe service we got was average, some of our dirty plates were on our tables a lil too long though.\n\nI'd like to try other places again before coming back here.  I guess the $16 price tag for lunch was a deal for the variety to keep everyone happy."
3,"Yesterday I needed to meet a client from North of the valley and I had other customers to visit in Deer Valley.  There are not many places in the area open for breakfast that are not chains so I picked here.  Getting there at 8 I probably missed most of the folks getting breakfast or picking up a sandwich to take with them for lunch. The guy who runs the place has almost an attitude but you warm up to him pretty quick.  \n\nI ordered the Max burrito which comes with egg, potato, cheese and your choice of bacon, sausage or ham ($4.29). It was pretty tasty.  It is moderate sized.  Price per ounce is easily twice that of a similar burrito at most of the local Mexican fast food places.  Part of that cost is location (Deer Valley is not cheap) and employee cost.\n\nWhile I was there there was a steady stream of folks coming in but never really busy.  It is hard sometimes to get in the parking area because of the backup for the Dunkin Donut located at the other end of the building.\n\nI am sure I will go back again because it isn't a chain, the food was OK and the service was pleasant."
3,"I'm going to settle this once and for all, since everyone seems beyond confused about the three China Stars in town. I drive past both of the Murray Ave China Stars every day (both located across the street from a Giant Eagle, presumably just to puzzle us more) and based on the addresses have confirmed the following--\n\nTHIS CHINA STAR:\n-4219 Murray Ave, in Greenfield\n-At the old location of Yen's Gourmet\n-No affiliation with the China Star in the North Hills\n-Standard American-Chinese food\n\nTHE OTHER CHINA STAR (http://www.yelp.com/biz/china-star-pittsburgh-3):\n-1900 Murray Ave, in Squirrel Hill\n-At the old location of Pacific Ring\n-Affiliated with the China Star in the North Hills\n-Traditional Chinese food\n\nSo, there you have it. A guide to the China Stars of Murray Avenue. I, personally, have only ordered from this China Star and cannot comment on the other.\n\nFor Chinese takeout--and I mean cheap, greasy, fried \""Chinese\"" food--China Star is awesome. I mean, yeah, every Chinese takeout place with the infamous red menu is pretty much the same, and I feel stupid even writing a review of one on Yelp. But I get a craving for General Tso's Chicken, Pork Lo Mein, Cold Sesame Noodles, and Fried Dumplings about once a month, and now having tried several of Pittsburgh's Chinese options based on price and convenience, I gotta say China Star is my number one choice. Everything just tastes GOOD. I totally can't justify giving a Chinese restaurant more than 3 stars, but next time you feel the need to pig out on greasy takeout food, I'd highly recommend China Star."
3,"cooked food are ok. but the ingredients selection is not high quality. nice decor but services could be better. Got to try the fried bananas, which is the best thing I like in this japanese all u can eat restaurant!"
3,"Fish and chips typical irish fare, have some good bands that plays there as well great for happy hour and hang outs great staff as well. U2 tribute band Joshua tree usually plays out there."
3,"This place is cool, but it pales in comparison to the Foundation Room, which sits at the top of the same hotel.  The music here was okay and the atmosphere here is kinda cool, but get yourself on the list for the Foundation Room to check out the cool club at Mandalay Bay."
3,"I think that the Monte Carlo has seen better days. It was once pretty dang nice and one of the best placed to go on the Strip, but it is starting to show some wear and tear. There is a -5 Bar, but it isn't the better one. I can see that there is some renovation going on, so that might mean that the place is on the up-swing. It is right in the middle of the Strip which makes it prime for those that want to stay in a central location. However, I think that I would not likely get a room here and opt for one of the newer, shinier places."
3,"I do love Rugged Wearhouse, and this one is pretty organized. Why am I giving 3 stars, because I bought a pair of boots for $25, not a bad price, but the tag from the store was still on the shoes and it was marked $20.\n I still bought them, but why keep a tag that clearly states your selling something higher than what they are worth at a department store. Annoyed."
3,"I really like the ambiance of Beckett's Table, from the way the restaurant is set up to their water glasses and table settings. I just didn't fall in love with their food. \n\nI liked the bacon cheddar buscuits, but would have liked them more if the apple honey butter wasn't so rock hard and was easily spreadable. I tried to the green chile pork stew and the osso buco and I definitely wasn't blown away by either of them. Neither dish had anything special to it, not to say they were bad, but didn't overly impress me. \n\nMy favorite dish was probably the chocolate dipped bacon s'mores. I definitely went out on a limb ordering this, but I was pleasently surprised. The homemade peanut butter was excellent and all of the parts of this dessert complimented each other very well."
3,Didnt feel great after eating this. Poor service. But good veggie options as always. Too expensive.  When i went there they ran out of spring rolls. Definitely not filling either.
3,"Perfect location, fresh food, maybe-a-little-too-small-of-portions.\n\nJust outside of the Henderson Whole Foods, LYFE Kitchen is the ideal restaurant to be found. Before going on our weekly shopping trip today, we decided to walk a few steps over to grab a bite to eat. I ordered the vegan thai curry bowl and a hibiscus tea while my beau ordered the grass-fed burger and a cafe mocha. \n\nThe drinks: to die for. I found the hibiscus tea extremely flavorful and refreshing, and he found the cafe mocha tasty and (as he was hoping) energizing. The meals: small portions, decent flavor. My vegan thai curry bowl tasted great but was a little more spicy than I was prepared for. It also could have stood for more wheatberries and a little more tofu, as well, rather than so many filler vegetables. His grass-fed burger was good and had a slight hickory flavor. \n\nAt the conclusion of the meal, though, we were still kind of hungry and were left wishing there was more food on each plate. I was also left with two questions: Is the tofu organic? What about the grass-fed beef? If not, then I don't see the point of coming to a restaurant that is marketed as health-conscious to eat conventionally grown soy and meat - yuck!\n\nWe may return to try a couple of the other menu items, but next time it won't be when we're super hungry!"
3,"I've never been terribly impressed with the food. Way overpriced for the mediocre entrees they're serving up. But this is a great place to go for drinks & appetizers - sit on the patio around the fountain. The appetizers are decent and fairly priced and the ambiance is really nice. I like to take tourists here when they visit me. (Then if they're still hungry, we'll go to Los Sombreros for dinner!)\n\nDo try their homemade tortillas with flavored butter - they're better than anything on the menu."
3,"The food was really good, but the service was bad. The waitress was hard to find and they were far from busy. It also took like 5 minutes just to get a soda & the same amount of time for water."
3,"It's like Samurai Sam's, but not as good. \n\nThe prices are reasonable and the portions decent, but the steak is really too thin for my liking.  The sauce is ok.  It's actually not as sweet as other places in town (I prefer it more soy/salty than sweet) and they give you a small container if you want more."
3,"Good food, but a little expensive.  Their cable cars are delicious.  Food was good, but not great.  For breakfast, I'd recommend going to the buffet at the Bellagio instead - it was much cheaper, and the food was about as good."
3,"Gotta update this review unfortunately after trying the Thin Crust.\n\nIt was HORRIBLE. Absolutely they should just remove it from the menu.\n\nWe decided to give it a go, got a Sausage and Bacon, after being promised it would be better than Rosatis thin and Oreganos. No chance. We had to send it back and ask for it to be removed from our tab. The crust was like cardboard and you could barely bite through it.\n\nOn the upside, the Penne pasta with meat sauce was fantastic.\n\nIf you come for Pizza, stick with the Butter Crust Deep Dish."
3,"I'll leave my review at 3 stars for now.  This was my first visit to a Panera Bread to get sandwiches for dinner.  We needed a break from getting subs at different places and I chose to try something new.  This location opened recently.  It makes where I live about halfway between to Panera's but I decided to try this one.\n\nService was great at the counter, but the wait seemed long for the take out until I realized they had a number of people eating in who had ordered just before I got there.  I brought the sandwiches home and they were very good.  My wife had their Cuban chicken panini and I had the signature Steak and white cheddar.  They were both very good.  My panini had a fair kick from the horseradish spread on the sandwich.  With the sandwiches, I opted for the small bag of chips for each of us.\n\nThe order was packaged really nice in two small cardboard boxes.  My only complaint with this is there's really no way to tell which sandwich is which unless you peel back some of the bread to reveal the contents.  Some places put a numbered sticker on their sandwiches to match the items on your receipt.  The boxes at Panera have a place you could write the name.  I sent a suggestion to HQ and the responded that they'd look into it.\n\nI'll return and I think I'll eat in.  The dining room is very nice and there's outdoor seating for when it's cooler."
3,"A good club, no casino, no pool or extra whistles found inside nothing extravagant here. 54 it's strictly a dance club. Just dancing, drinking, chilling with friends and enjoying the tunes. 80s music is played a bit too much some nights if you ask me but then the DJ switches it up and you start dancing to the current tunes you like without feeling weird about it. One night, Floyd Mayweather hosted his official boxing fight Afterparty here. The dude made it rain\n\n54 tends to be frequent by an older good looking crowd, late 20s to late 30s with some just turn 21 hotties mixed in. But the best part of studio 54 is the gogo dancers, they're pretty cool, will talk and say hi to you and for what they wear, leaves very little to the imagination. So try not to get carried away!"
3,"Unfortunately, we didn't have dessert.  Instead, we had brunch, and enjoyed it, although the potato pancakes were weak.  If I go back, I'll try dessert or go late in the day and sit at the bar."
3,"Tequila selection isn't what it used to be, and the menu has a lot of inaccuracies (sorry sir, we don't have that tequila anymore either).  Food was alright but service was a chore, and it wasn't very busy either."
3,"Being that I lived in SC for years I wasn't expecting much from Hokkaido. Some of the seafood dishes were the normal overly cooked american versions of Chinese that you can get anywhere, but they did have some interesting and tasty food. \n\nMy BF liked some of the cooked beef. I liked the crab, and the sushi wasn't as bad as it could have been. The seaweed salad was better than expected. I LOVED the chocolate fountain! (who doesn't?)  \n\nI was overall pleased with the food, but I expected a different atmosphere (I don't know what I was thinking). There were screaming kids in seats and running around EVERYWHERE! Bleh. I know they charge an extra fee for wasting food... they should charge one for bad ass kids too..."
3,"Stayed for one night this week.  Furniture (even the couch) was dusty.  Dirty coffee maker, filthy hair dryer...I could go on...\n\nCould not get an itemized room service receipt or even a receipt for my stay emailed to me.  It is almost like they opened the hotel without being ready.  \n\nI would recommend this hotel for the location only.  If you are in town for work, I would highly recommend the HGV on the strip.  Very well maintained and amazing customer service."
3,"Rehab burger is your total local dive bar but has a cool vibe to it as well. They offer great drink specials, and have a great burger menu. I had there Hangover burger with the sweet potato tots and to me it was pretty mediocre plus I ordered my burger medium rare and received a well done burger so of course I am sure that had something to do with the taste. Would I go back and give em another shot? Probably not considering there are alot more great burger joints in Scottsdale."
3,"I've driven by the City Cafe several times, but I never had time to stop in.  The other day i was walking by and decided to try it for lunch.\n\nThey have a limited lunch menu right now, but the owner told me he was planning on expanding it.   I had a burrito and a marvelous glass of fresh brewed green iced tea.   It was great.\n\nI will be back."
3,"While I wish AYW was a little cheaper, they are a fun place for the kiddos to express their creativity.  \n\nThe staff is, for the most part, friendly and helpful.  A few times, the younger female staff have been more preoccupied with chatting among themselves, but that doesn't appear to be the norm. \n\nTurn around time on the pieces is quick, just a few days, which is nice."
3,"I love the food, location is great, love the rootop patio...no problems there\n\nBUT...the drink prices are FRIGGIN OUTRAGEOUS, as has been mentioned in other reviews. To get drink prices this high you either have to be drinkin' in a strip bar  or one of the ultra chi-chi bars uptown like Blue.....at least $2 higher on beer and $3-4 higher on drinks than ANY OTHER P-Wood bar. As I've worked in bars before I understand how drinks are priced and these prices are NOT gonna be popular around here. Everyone that I've heard talk about it has the same thing to say: \""great food, great location, plan on drinking tea or soda when you go unless you want to go broke..\""...C'Mon guys, you don't have to recoup your investment the 1st month by gouging folks on drinks; price them reasonably and you'll be around for a long time to make money..."
3,"Keep in mind their sign actually reads Taqueria Express.\n\nThis is a tiny little taco stand carved out of Fruteria El Pueblo just west of Woodlands on Albemarle. Orders are placed at a window overlooking a stuffed, hot kitchen. Food is quick and simple. Menu's surprisingly large - lots of tacos, quesadillas, burritos - didn't seen any Salva-or-Ecuadorian influences on there. Language could be an issue if you no tengo un pequeno espanol.\n\nI have a thing for tortas, so that's what I got - and it was good. A little pricey (6.50 for huevos y queso) but easily one of the better ones I've had in CLT. Soft, sweet teleras, Monterey-Jacky cheese, shredded lettuce, some jalapenos. A mess to eat, but whatevs.\n\nThis isn't the \""IT\"" torta, but it's totally worth a stop."
3,Just an average run-of-the-mill commercial donut shop. Very clean. Open 24hrs & housed together with a Subway.  Donuts were fresh. The devils food cake was moist & chocolaty and the glazed had good flavor. I think Winchells is a lot better then Dunkin Donuts or them nasty sugar holes from Krappy Kremes. Overall grade C. Selection was decent.
3,"I have always been an Outback fan. For a chain restaurant, Outback does a really good job. I typically sit at the bar and the bar staff is ALWAYS friendly and accommodating. Last week I decided to take out. I ordered salmon, broccoli and a sweet potato. The salmon and broccoli were very good - they were cooked the right way and seasoned well. The sweet potato however was so overcooked it was as if they had kept it in the oven for several months ;-) Just kidding but the po-ta-to was killed to be sure.\nA minor detail but worth mentioning."
3,"We headed to City Center for a late dinner before heading out to the clubs for the evening, and picked Julian Serrano because they had vegetarian options on the menu for me.  I have to admit, I was mildly disappointed in our experience at Julian Serrano.  We ordered the mushroom soup, Tortilla Espanola, Shrimp Ceviche, chicken skewers, eggplant/peppers, and mixed Paella (lobster, chorizo, chicken).  The paella was pretty good, but I have definitely had better...for $40, I was expecting it to blow my mind.  The other items were just okay.  The d\u00e9cor was great, the service was excellent, and their menu and wine list looked promising...but frankly, I have had tapas that were ten times better at my favorite dive tapas bar here in San Francisco, for about a third of the price.  \n\nI probably wouldn't come running back here the next time I was in Vegas, unless someone else was paying."
3,"Had lunch here for my birthday with co-workers and i liked the atmosphere so came back for the happy hour--had a great time with friends.  \n\nIs a little expensive, but had great service from our server-girl with robot tattoo--so nice!\n\nI think i loved the cocktails better than the food, POLYNESIAN CHICKEN SANDWICH was pretty good with the SWEET POTATOE FRIES!!  \n\nMost drinks were fabulous, need to try the Scorpion bowl with lots of friends!"
3,"We eat here occasionally and the experience is consistent and mediocre. More Arby's than Subway, because the ingredients are uninspiring. Nor is it a great value in that it is only slightly less expensive than real sushi. All that said, it is convenient fast and strangely satisfying"
3,Loved the set up..drinks. .and staff were friendly. .but the bald manager with the moon boot on ..totally had some kind of attitude. .even our waitress said he was a jerk..\nOther then that I would go back amd totally avoid this dick..prices are decent. .I only had appetizers they were ok..
3,For diner food it was good. As long as you go in expecting that you'll be fine. Got the Spanish omelet. Very tasty. Service is a little slow though
3,"It pains me to write an update for this place because I really had exceptional experiences before my last two appointments. It may be because my appointments were scheduled at 5:30 (prime time for working folk who go after work). I had at least a 30-45 minute wait both times and that was just in the waiting room. When I got to an exam room, had to wait another 15-20 minutes to be seen. \n\nI still love Dr. Langford because she apologized profusely for the wait. I understand 5:30 is a prime time but they could avoid the wait by not overbooking. I still got the same warm, undivided attention from the doctor so the wait didn't bother me so much after that.\n\nAlso I called twice prior to an appointment and spoke to someone who I found to be quite rude. She said she would check on something for me and call me back. I didn't get a call back so when I called again, she said she already told me the answer (when she clearly told me she'd double check with the doctor). I don't appreciate people who are rude  to loyal patients.\n\nEven though I had a bad experience, there are other staff members who are kind and are good at their job. I am still happy with most of the staff and with my doctor. I just can't give them 5 stars anymore. 3.5 stars."
3,"There are good things about this place.  It is a great place to watch a game and the staff seems to care.  The menu is good and the food seems flavorful for a bar. My problem with this place is the last few times we have been there, the food is cold coming to my table.  I hate cold food."
3,"First timer had breakfast. A little pricey but the food was very good and atmosphere was unique (in a good way).   We were there just before lunch started so it wasn't busy at all. The only disappointment was the young robotic staff. A genuine smile and \""good morning\"" would go a long way to making this a special place."
3,"Decent service, good food. However I have to admit seeing all this dust everywhere throughout the restaurant especially on my booth was pretty gross. I'm amazed how this went unnoticed. I took it upon myself to leave a little note. The server saw me and the dust and commented \""hahaha yeah there's a lot of dust here.\"" Wooooooow really?"
3,"It is not your average-Charlotte menu. Most of the food is fried and it is certainly flavorful, but I wouldn't say spicy or hot. \n\nIt is a decent casual place to grab lunch and I would certainly go back."
3,"Came here 15 minutes before closing and only had to wait 10 minutes for the chicken to cook.  This place is really small.  The pictures don't lie.  \n\nThe chicken was pretty good although it's probably only good when its served hot and fresh.  It is a little on the salty side as some reviews have pointed out.  I enjoyed the hot sauce alot.  \n\nThe lady there was really nice and gave us a free 2 liter of soda and 4 extra pieces of chicken bc they were cleaning up and we weren't able to sit at the counter.  \n\nThey didnt have any of their red velvet pancakes which seems common among these reviews but no worries as I have a 2nd groupon to redeem.\n\nFunny thing I read about Flavor Flav's failed restaurant in Clinton, Iowa just a year ago.  Hopefully this location will fare better over time.   This place is decent - take away Flavor Flav and I'm not sure if this place would have much success. 2 stars + 1 star b/c it's Flavor Flav"
3,"Ah the rare case of me randomly going to a restaurant with someone and checking Yelp only afterwards to discover that it's 2 stars!\nThe service was a little weird. First of all, the 2 of us had no idea what the host was saying at all. Later, my lunch companion got his soup at least 10 min before I got mine. He seemed to like his. I got the duck meat soup with rice noodles. I don't think the noodles were fully cooked. The broth was good, the duck meat that I fished out was good. There was questionable green stuff floating in my soup which was really salty and might have been seaweed or something.\nObviously, the place wasn't cheap (Caesar's Palace!). Walk out of the hotel and go somewhere else!"
3,"Russ suggested My Florist for lunch since we were in the area, but I said, \""well I always go there at night and while sitting at My Florist, see this cute little lunch place across the street that I've been wanting to try, so let's go there.\"" \n\nIt's good for a quick lunch and an alternative to fast food (anything is better than the F food).\n\nI got the chicken feta pita, it was okay, kinda boring.  I think I liked the design of the place better than the food. So, ++ for good marketing and design, now if they'd do something more interesting with the menu :)"
3,"Brunch on a rainy Sunday. Interior is nice. Service was excellent. Coffee- Meh. Our entrees looked nice- they appeared to be made with all fresh ingredients with good technique, but the flavors were disappointing. How could something that looks so carefully prepared be so uninteresting in the mouth? I mentioned to the waitress that my buckwheat crepe (which was cooked perfectly) was cold inside (I don't think they warmed up the ham in any way before filling) she kindly comped our coffees. I only ate part of my breakfast because I just got bored about 1/3 of the way through.  I would go back in hopes that the other dishes would have a more more interesting balanced flavors."
3,"Pink's, I don't know how you seduced me, but you did. \n\nA small group of us stopped here because we were hungry and have heard people rave about this place. I was feeling brave and got the Chili Cheese hot dog burrito with two dogs, chili and cheese wrapped in a tortilla. It did the trick for a drunken evening, but man talk about super upset stomach! Maybe if I ever ate there again I should just try the basic hot dog."
3,"After moving from Chicago to Scottsdale, this was one of the first places we tried  Overall, I felt underwhelmed.  After hearing that this was one of the best sushi places in Scottsdale, I expected something great.  Maybe my expectations were too high.  My Sapporo was great (and much needed in this July heat!) and the sushi was fine.  My favorite was a roll with fried fish skin in it -- not sure what it was called, but it was tasty.  I would go back, but it is not a favorite for me!"
3,"One of my favorite locations because it is conveniently located across from my work building. The parking is good - even better for me since I can walk. The concessions are cheap - $4 for a hot dog or soda. A combo pack of a hot dog, drink and popcorn for $11. The views are good and provides good access to players if you want to try for an autograph. As another reviewer pointed out, there is no outfield grass, which is a disappointment. Another thing that is down is the feeling in your ass after sitting on the metal bleacher style seats down the left field line  - but for $7, good parking, nice location and cheap concessions, I am a fan."
3,"I Was there from Thursday to Sunday. I cannot complain about the price - since the room was ordered from an agency outside of the country - and it was half price of what I found online. (Vegas.com, Expedia, hotels.com). \nThe location of the hotel - 5 stars - right In the best part of the strip\nCasino - 5 stars. Professional dealers and plenty of games. \nFood - 2 stars. No Starbucks in The hotel. \nNo 24/7 restaurant. You have to walk all the way to Bally's to grab a slice of pizza or subway at 3 am when you really need it . . \nThe room - 2.5 stars  - the bed - horrible. Springy and cheap. Felt really bad ony back. \n(I am 31 years old , not 75 - and still it was bad) \nFor some reason they decided to locate the tv away from the bed - so it's not convenient to watch from the bed. The room was clean and felt expensive. But I wouldn't expect anything else from a hotel that is on the strip. \nAverage - 3 stars. I would come back again because its a good value fort vacation. \nI must also state that I have been in Vegas many times and for someone who is there for the 1st time - the hotel would probably be amazing. ;-)"
3,"I don't have a complaint about the food.  I have a complaint about the location and the decor.  We had the lobster for two.  A much better deal than buying everything separate off of the menu.  For two, it cost about $150.  The food was tasty and the Chardonay was great!  The restaurant is not fancy and it is in a part of Caesars that looks like a mall.  The restaruant looks like a store front at a cheasy mall.  Very disappointing.  For the price, I would go to a fancier restaurant.  I was dressed up for a night on the town and was out of place at this bib-wearing cartoon pictures pasted on the wall restaurant.  The only thing missing were the peanut shells on the floor.  Too high priced for such a casual place in an ugly area."
3,"Recommend for DATE NIGHT or group experience\n\nSo I am a hiking, white water rafting, run on a regular type of woman.\nI am all about active activities, yet my experience at Victory Lanes was really disappointing. Riding in circles at high speeds and cramped in a kart aren't my idea of a good time. It just did not wow me, but I will give it another try if I had a group of friends.\n\nLocation: Easy to spot from highway, but use GPS or you will get lost \nPrice: we bought a members pass\nStaff: Able to answer questions; prepare to sign your life away\nChildren can act as spectators, but I wouldnt encourage driving\nBathrooms would get a 2/5 not big enough for dressing room.\nSuites are cool and help with excitement, the look awesome in pictures."
3,Food is ok...drinks or ok...beer is beer but I love pubs so if I'm at mandalay Bay I stop for a pint no matter what!!!!  My ex says it's the best shepherds pie he's had in this whole entire life so maybe try that!
3,"So the first time I went here, I don't remember a thing. Did I have a good time? I think I did.\n\nAnyway, I went to Rok again and it wasn't that bad. In comparison to other clubs, this place isn't that bad. The bar service was slow but the music was usually good.  \n\nGood: This place is good, if you get in for free.\n\nBad: Not my number one choice in Vegas.\n\nFinal: If you can get in for free or close to it, this place is the place to be."
3,"I love the food at Paradise Bakery, but this location can be hit or miss with the quality. I've given up on calling in orders to pick up because the majority of the time they are incorrect, missing items from my meal, or not even made upon my arrival. Recently they extended their business hours, but often are out of items near the end of the day. When the food is good, it is great though. Just gets frustrating with the quality when things aren't prepared right, especially since Paradise isn't cheap."
3,"A friend and I are on a quest to find the best steak in the Valley, so every time we meet for dinner, we choose a different steak place to try. Our visit to Fleming's was far below my expectations. \n\nI had heard wonderful things about Fleming's for their happy hour, and, indeed, the happy hour has some great options. I'll return for that. Service was decent; we remained at the bar. And there was a fantastic wine selection with reasonable prices. \n\nHowever, when it comes to steak: mine was overcooked (I ordered it medium) and not sufficiently trimmed (I got a filet). Sides were unmemorable."
3,"Great place for a quick cheap meal. If your new to Filipino food, I would start off with the barbecue and pancit. If you're feeling more adventurous, try the dinuguan (blood stew) or balut (fertilized duck egg), if available. My mom still makes better dinuguan and pancit but this place is pretty good for price and convenience. I prefer to get take-out because sometimes they play terrible and depressing Filipino dramas on their TVs. The constant crying in the background is not appetizing."
3,"Ok, I am not going to talk about the service too much because I think It's a cultural issue. their wait service is NOT friendly at all. The waitress and waiter do not know how to smile.\n\nHowever, I have to say that the service never detracts us from going there. The reason is the food is so good. If you are there during there lunch special, try the shredded pork pan fried noodles order it \""Hong Kong Style\""\n\nOur second favorite dish is the salt and pepper shrimps with the head on. Some people find eating the head weird, but it is so rich.\n\nThe third dish to try is the salt fish and chicken fried rice. Salty but really good. I know this is not the typical \""American ordering Chinese food\"" (i.e. General Cho's Chicken and Shrimp fried rice) type of order but trust me These are the best things on the menu."
3,"The fish department was good someone always there to help and didn't wait to long but they need to train \""Tyler\"" the cashier on good customer service :)"
3,"The service here is ok, depending on the time of day.  What is pretty funny is in the morning the first thing we always got asked was if we needed a drink to cure our hangover.   So on Saturday and Sunday I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak for breakfast.  It was pretty good. Anywhere I go, if a place has chicken fried steak, I'll try it.  This place did not disappoint.  On Sunday everyone at my table ordered Chicken Friend Steak accept one person, because I thought it was good. After they tried it, they were glad they ordered it.  It has the right amount of batter to meat ratio.\n\nI didn't like the coffee shake.  It didn't taste like coffee, and Jack in the box can make a better shake.  But I will go there anytime I stay at the Hard Rock and really there is either this or the Pink Taco. Pink Taco was good too, but that is another review."
3,"Not the best car wash on Bell road that's for sure. Two times I have brought my car for a wash and the keys were left in my vehicle. This scares me as auto theft is huge in Arizona. Customer service is so-so. I usually bring my vehicle early morning before 9. If you want to get the early bird discount be sure to pay before 9am as I learned from experience. Brought my car in at 7am walked across the street to work, picked it up at lunchtime and paid to find out I can't get my early bird discount because the hand written receipts are not time stamped."
3,"I want so much to love the Daily Dose.  It is in the perfect location for me to make it my go-to spot for weekend brunches.  But I just can't get 100% behind it.  Every time I'm there, I search the extensive menu over and over again for something that jumps out at me.  But every time, I find myself at a loss and just ordering an omelette or french toast or something equally banal.  I'll keep searching, but with every trip my hope dwindles."
3,"Been here a few times. Drinks are not really good. Service is great.\n\nTried a few of the cocktails, they tasted good, but were lacking in EtOh. Had to get a few extra to get the job done."
3,"It has a Vue Cinema, the entrance to Britannia, Starbucks, Bear Company, M&S Food-Court, H&M, Superdry, Fat Face, HMV, Boots, FCUK, Baxter, GAP,  Debenhams and a beautiful laid out Food Court - with Zizzi, Burger Company etc.. \n\nI do like the food-court,  with its view over Fife and new developments of Newhaven. (I compare those views with Blade Runner scenes..) \n\nNot my favourite shopping centre - as it is more like an main street shopping missing the charity shops (apart from the Superdry Store) \nI go shopping here when I have a few hours to spare on a Sunday. \n\nIt is clean building in and out and has got a straightforward layout  rectangular and 3 stories high. \n\nThere is a car park and a bus terminus for Lothian buses 22, 35, 34, 36, 11\nAlso the tourist buses stop here. \n\nThere are (still) plans to extend the (in)famous tram line to here but those are currently shelved"
3,"One of the smallest airport in the U.S.  Flew here for a short layover to Greenville (GSP).  Can't really stand small airport since all the planes are so small and me being 6'4\"" is very difficult to sit comfortably in my seat.  Next time I'll fly into big airports."
3,"When I was 12 my older sister got her first apartment. And she took me with her to Pier 1. I was in little boy gay heaven. And to think, she wanted my pubescent ass to help her decorate. Hmmm....do you think she knew something. Anyway, wow, all that great Pier 1 stuff. Director chairs, lava lamps, bamboo vases with baby's breath...if only I could replace my bedroom's Charlie's Angels motif for all this. But we were here for big sis. In those 25 plus years....Pier 1 hasn't changed that much. And that's cool. I just think they've gotten a little big for their britches and the prices are too high and don't match the quality of the product. A balsa wood nightstand? Hmmmm...not gonna work. But those cute little plates with the palm trees. Nice touch. And do you think you could jam anymore into this space? Word of caution to future Pier 1 shoppers: limit your pre Pier 1shopping cocktails to only two. Otherwise you just bump into stuff. And break a lamp. Or something. So I heard."
3,Tried it out last night and I have mixed feelings. It was busy at 9:30pm on a Tuesday.  The decor is nice and they made a good use of the space. We tried the sliders and they were good. We sat at the bar and a bar tender came up and asked my husband if he wanted a drink but did not even acknowledge me.  My husband was then served a beer he did not ask for. Two of the other bartenders were very nice and clearly knew what they were doing. The bartender who ignored me then decided to ignore both us for the rest of our stay. Never refilled our drinks and we waited 20 minutes after hitting the cash out button before anyone came to check on us. There was a forth bartender who was good at collecting plates and glasses but didn't ask if we needed anything else. I will probably give them one more chance since they are new.
3,"Lots of great beers on tap(Modelo Especial, Negro Modelo, Delerium Tremens, etc).  Great concept with the nachos.  Service could have been better.  Try the Flortentine Nachos!"
3,"We sat outside since it was a nice night. There was a party of 10 outside that immediately started doing shots. Add that to the fact that 5 of them were smoking and it took away from the experience. Our server did his best but was a bit overwhelmed from the large party. And was asked to take photos by 3 different tables. Tacky on the patrons part. He was clearly struggling as it was. The food was good, even though one of our orders was wrong. We chalked it up and took it. It was close. Fajita chimmichonga instead of just chicken. Still was good. Would definitely go back."
3,"This Whole Foods is the baby bear of the three in town, but doesn't skimp on selection or variety. I don't come to this one too often, but I do like the feel it has just because it is in a smaller space.\n\nI did notice they have an attractive produce section that included nopales! Their produce section is always really nicely put together when I'm there and very rarely do I see anything out of place-but again, I don't come in here that often.\n\nTheir meat counter is significantly smaller than the other two locations, but deli, salad bar, prepared foods section were about the same size as the other locations.\n\nAll in all, a decent branch of this chain."
3,"What's better than mini golf? Mini golf with drunk people! After DW we came here to pass some time before those who did bottomless mimosas red glow receeded. Thanks Anthony M. for treating us to mini golf. You're nice and sassy when you're drunk. \n\nI think the name Putt Park is accurate as it was more like putting course than mini golf with fun themes. So judging purely from the course though, I wish they tried to at least make a few of them more difficult and unique. There were some that was rather similar. Still it was a good way to pass time and have fun bonding silly time with some of the best people. We did try to play a normal game, at least I did since I was pretty sober, but the drunkeness took over. A few times it took everyone to get the ball in which was entertaining. Aayyeeehehe. \n\nFor $8.50 it is decent enough and at least your ball doesn't disappear into a hole that takes it like a lot of mini golf places does. It could have replay value I suppose if you really like to putt and get the most out of your admission, but once was good for us. \n\nBest advice - come here after being plastered at DW during brunch and it would be way more fun and be a great way to spend your afternoon like we did.\n\n(Yelp 100 Challenge 23/100)"
3,"hmm.. $20 lunch buffet (on a Monday). not bad. definitely cheaper than the Wynn.\n\nI pretty much ransacked the cocktail shrimp station and must've eaten half their supply when we were there. i tried the lamb, duck, turkey, pretty much a little bit of everything. all was decent enough.. but nothing amazing. the lamb with mint jelly was probably the highlight of my meal, along with the napoleon (dessert). dessert is my favorite part of the meal! i was slightly disappointed that they didnt have crab or lobster, but i guess for $20 wut do you expect. sushi was california rolls.. the kind i can make at home. the service (aka the person bringing us drinks) was good. \n\nhmm.. wut else.. nothing else i can really say about the buffet here.. i think next time i'll try the buffet at Paris."
3,I ate here w/my gal pal after a late night of poker and we sat at the bar where the bartender was very friendly and accomodating!  We shared a pizza and the dumplings (which come w/duck inside) and it was all pretty tasty.  This is your upscale version of the Cheesecake Factory...it all looks the same inside!
3,"The buffet is great, yet the downside is the changes over the years. There is only one station to get crab or lobster now. You can wait up to 15 min just for plate AFTER waiting to get seated. Obvious they are trying to reduce cost and make you wait a huge amount of time instead. This needs improvement. It used to be much better and they are seeing if they can get away with no one noticing. -2 stars for this."
3,"The lobster pot pie was fabulous, as billed, but the service was lacking.  Our waiter disappeared for a half an hour.  They could have sold us a lot of drinks in that amount of time, but missed out.\nI realize the pot pie is a signature dish, but they should set a better expectation of how long it takes to get it to table.  Perhaps if we three women instead of fifty year old guys we would have gotten more attention."
3,I had lunch at this restaurant.  The roast beef sandwich was good.  The other people at my table had the Thai salad and they really enjoyed that.  It was huge.  Another person in the group had the Mahi and liked it.  The staff was attentive and nice.  I recommend that you check it out.  It was not cheap though.
3,"Much like Jenny I have to say A-ok is this place in a nutshell.\n\nWas there on Saturday in an attempt to cure my hangover. Again being a lover of meat I was really hoping this place would prove to be an awesome burger salvation.\n\nI was ok, it jkust fails to hit the high notes. They get so much right it really is a shame, the service is fantastic - the girls interact with the customers and helpfully advise on their favourites and suggestions.\n\nI had the Pestorica or something to that effect, burger with relish, pesto mozzarella etc. Also had a side of onion rings with dips.\n\nThe burger when it comes is visually fantastic and seems huge, the pedto and mozzarella are great, the salad fine. To the burger - its just too thin. When you order they make a point of saying are you happy for the burger to be cooked medium, to which i smiled and said medium rare is fine by me!!\n\nThe burger is far too think to maintain a juicy redish centre that I was hoping to see and lacks a bit of seasoning.\n\nThe onion rings are dipped in corn flour and fried, i prefer a batter as it sticks to the onion better, these were crumbly and greasy and just not what i had hoped for.\n\nTo finish I had an oreo milk shake which was awesome to the max! \n\nThis place could be the best burger joint in town but for now sadly they are letting themselves down!!"
3,"Went for the brunch Saturday morning and the line wasn't too bad at 11am. I noticed upon exiting that they have some self pay kiosk terminals that would be beneficial when lines long.\n\nThey have an omelette station and I got two eggs over easy. I recommend this over the egg mix they use for omelets, or powdered eggs for scrambled.  In the other breakfast area they had potatoes and Portuguese sausage. \n\nI then found the salmon lox, capers, onion and made a killer croissant sandwich. No bagels? Finished up with some fresh fruit and Greek yogurt. \n\nA lot of stuff looks good, but it wasn't according to my friends. There aren't any high end items like prime rib, crab legs, or lamb.  It's a solid 2.5 stars or 3, but watch what you eat and you can enjoy your meal and not feel like a slug the rest of the day."
3,"I don't quite get this place. I see what they are trying to do,but the food is not as good as most high end steak houses in Vegas and he prices are way too high. The only thing I can figure is most meals are comped and it makes the ego driven gamblers think they are really getting a three hundred dollar meal, your not. The service cannot get any better its  just the food does not compare to Cut,Delmonicos,Del frisco ect. If you want old Vegas feel go to Hugos in the four queens the food is good with the same mob look but the prices are one third this place"
3,This Paradise location is one of the noisiest locations I have ever been to. Keep that in mind if you are planning a lunch business meeting. Otherwise the service is great!
3,"We chose this place because it was convenient for a Tuesday night show we were seeing at the Luxor.  Hostess reception was beyond rude and completely ridiculous.  There was no wait, but our party went to sit in the bar because we wanted quick service.  After sitting at what we thought was a bar table for about 5 minutes, the long-blond-haired hostess came up to tell us that we were at a dining table and escorted us back to wait for a table (apparently, there are no tables that qualify as \""bar seating\"").  We stood there for another 10 minutes, just to have her take us back to the EXACT SAME TABLE!  She then, literally, tossed our menus on the table and walked away before we had even sat down.  Disbelief is the only word I can use to describe this experience.  Thankfully, our server more than made up for this terrible first impression.  There was good teamwork between him and his busser as they both worked hard to accommodate our need for speedy service.  Food was good, but nothing to get excited about.  We enjoyed the steak quesadilla and steak/bacon tacos."
3,"If you want to stop off to see the worlds largest thermometer and have some food, then this stop is for you. The Mad Greek in itself is an ok place. There are two locations; one in Baker (near Death Valley) and then one near the entrance to LV. It's usually packed so if you like Greek food, then this may be for you. From what I remember, the falalel balls were tasty and weren't overly fried. A creamy Tahini sauce accompanies most dishes which is perfect since the weather here is HOT! The restaurant designed with roman statues and columns on the outside so you can't miss it when you are exiting. The inside is more like a greek cafeteria and is congested with a lot of seating space and people to match. The Baker stop has an option for a decent bathroom and like I said before, if you look to the left of the Mad Greek, you will see a large pole showing the temperature. This is the only one found in America and although it boasts that it shows the right temperature, its actually off a couple of degrees."
3,"Pretty standard for an Italian place. The food was good but not super amazing. The service was okay too, our waiter was really rushed and would walk away before we were done talking to him. The prices were a little high for what you actually get but not outrageous or anything. Overall the it's has a nice atmosphere and a consistent taste so I'd definitely give it another try."
3,"I really wanted to like this place - I live nearby and was happy to see that we had another locally owned restaurant in NE Mesa. But....the food and service just really weren't very good. The table was sticky, the service was VERY rushed (pressured to order, and then salads were brought out about 30 seconds after our appetizer) and the food was just \""meh.\"" \n\nWe started with the brushchetta - which was incredibly dissapointing. The toppings were good enough, but it was served on flatbread which was cold and tasted rather stale. I prefer it on sliced bread like its made at Postino or D'Vine. \n\nMy husband had the orichette with sausage - it was oversalted and the sausage was pretty bland. I had porcini ravioli with a tomato cream sauce, which would have been much better had the sauce not been so oversalted. \n\nThe ambiance is ok - large TV's in the bar, which I guess are fine if you are sitting in the bar, but they were kind of distracting from the dining room. \n\nI doubt we'll return, it just wasn't good enough for the $$$ spent."
3,"Great location, but make sure you check in early! I checked in after 11pm on a wkday in June 10' and they didnt have a decent room available. I was put in a room for hearing impaired smokers! I had to wait until 2 pm the following day to be upgraded to a nicer room. The upgrade was amazing, but i was annoyed that i had to make sure i was back at my room early afternoon to change rooms. Other than that the hotel was OK. \n\n-oh & the pool isnt anything too fancy."
3,"This mall is a lot smaller than the ones that I walked through in Vegas, especially since they don't have a huge number of stores for you to look at.\n\nWhile the interiors and decorations of the mall looked really nice, the stores that they had were super pricey.\n\nWell, if you want to take a nice little walk in a shopping area, then this place is okay to do so."
3,"Pretty polular chain. The service is usualy pretty good here, I've had more positive experiences than not.\n\n I usuay get grilled cheese with hash browns nearly everytime I go there, even in the evenings. I love the way the bread is crispy and the cheese is melted. One time I came here the sanwich looked as though the put the cheese in between, then put it on the grill for a few seconds and took it off. The cheese wasn't melted at all. I asked the lady if the cheese can be melted more and she replied \""that's how we always make them, but I'll have them melt it more.\"" I've been there enough times to know that is not the case. When my plate came back the whole thing was hot. She put the whole plate in the microwave. Not only did she put it in the microwave, she put it in there too long. The cheese was like rubber. And the bread didnt taste good. \nSomething else I like to get are the cheese sticks. They're really good when the cheese is perfectly melted on the inside. You have to eat them while they're hot. I use ranch and marinara dipping sauces. \n\nOther than that incident, the service is good. The food is good. Overall its a good place to just come, eat and converse with others. Or come have some alone time and eat, read the paper whatever."
3,"I saw the Blue Man Group last week with high expectations. It is one of the longest running shows in Las Vegas (although it is moving soon to the Monte Carlo) and is performed in a few other cities across the country. Understandably, I was excited.\n\nAnd while there were many great scenes, I thought the show lacked continuity. The three blue men would spend 5-10 minutes beating on drums and then for seemingly no reason start climbing the chairs in the audience. Then in the next scene they performed a very impressive marshmellow throwing trick (I won't spoil it) that seemed really random in execution. While everything they did was impressive, I've seen similar things done on the streets of Las Vegas Boulevard. I was especially confused with what each had to do with one another.\n\nThe show does get points for humor though. The comedic timing of the three blue men was terrific and there were at least a couple full laugh-out-loud moments. They also had some fun audience participation that would presumably make each show a little different. Plus it was very simple, slap stick humor, so it was appropriate for the whole family.\n\nUltimately, I enjoyed the show but it just didn't live up to the hype or the price."
3,Welcoming and cool inside. Had a wonderful and relaxing 90 minute full body massage for $40 including tip\n\nWill definitely come back again and tell all my friends and family.\n\nThanks to Ann Z for the recommendation.
3,"Came here with some work colleagues for a quick lunch. I've been for drinks a few times and I find it a reasonable local pub but wondered how it would be for lunch. \n\nThe Kilted Pig do a reasonable lunch menu of light bites (I think priced between \u00a33.50 and \u00a38) and includes soup, sandwiches, baked potatoes, fish pie, risotto and stovies. Plus you are still able to order off the normal menu.\n\nWe all ate off the lunch menu and although nothing fancy, everyone was impressed with their portions and enjoyed the food. We were just over the \u00a350 for 6 lunches, a bottle of wine and 3 soft drinks so we couldn't complain.\n\nI had booked a table a couple of days before. After explaining we needed a quick turnaround, I was given menu's away with me so we could phone in a pre-order before heading down so good service too."
3,Good.  Not great.  Service is quick as expected.  Too much coleslaw for my liking. Sandwich is good but pastrami was chewy.  Fries were a little undercooked. Asked for double meat but same amount as friend.  Don't go out of your way
3,"A-OK.  Please have better beer selection, that's my biggest gripe for a place labeled 'Tavern'.  The food was ok, nothing great.  \n\nTypical bar food grub.  My girlfriend ordered macaroni cheese and it was literally out of a Kraft box.  Her buffalo chicken though was pretty good, I must admit.\n\nI'd come back simply because it seems like a good comfy spot to watch a game or two.  Good friendly service too."
3,"It was spa day at the camelback inn spa. We had facials and massages, lunch, and then wanted to have some FaceTime since we don't see each other often. That's when the trouble began. The quiet police were after us! Finally, we escaped to the outside where there were no water spritsers. We found some icy towels to cool us. Andrea gave me a great facial and spent a lot of time with me answering questions about my skin, eyebags, and products that could help. If you favor silence to read and relax you will enjoy it! They offer lemon water, tea, and when you leave you can make your own sachet which was awesome. My sachet has lavender in it and really helps me get to sleep. A nice touch!! The food and drink offerings were very good and the attendants were always nearby to help or keep everyone quiet. Shhhh when you go there!"
3,"I give it three stars because their coffee was very indifferent to me and I think I should try their coffee twice before judging it. I will say the hours are bad for a coffee house, because they're only open until 7. I will definitely say there are better coffee places to go to then this."
3,"This is close to one of my offices and my co-workers enjoy enough that we are regulars here.  The lunchbox specials are pretty good, especially #1, the Short Rib.  I've also had some of their special sushi rolls.  The AZ Diamondback is pretty good.\n\nService is hit or miss, sometimes they just get over their head with customers and can never make up for the poor service.  Overall the food is pretty good and works out for lunch, sometime I will have to try the Koren Dinner."
3,"Ok I'm going to leave my rating at 3 stars because this place is a hit or miss. We were here the other night for happy hour and had such a great experience we came back on Fri for dinner. Not happy. My margarita was not good and my husband ordered the special - corned beef. It was over cooked, rubbery, and did not have any corned beef flavor. Highly disappointed. I ordered the pita pizza which was great again (thank goodness).\n\nI've had equally good and bad experiences here now. Not sure what to think. They aren't consistent."
3,"Bars on the Royal Mile are, if you ask me, pretty much exclusively reserved for tourists who don't realise how overpriced they are, and aren't looking for a 'local' with any sense of community.\n\nAnd to a certain extent, The Albanach fits all of those criteria: a cheeseburger and chips wiill set you back the best part of a tenner, and at every second table in the outside area there'll be somebody staring at a map of the centre with a slightly puzzled expression on their face.\n\nThat said, if I ever go for a drink with friends in this area we nearly always end up here at some point during the evening. House wine, although not exactly going to win any vintage awards, is only \u00a312 a bottle which isn't much more than the price of a glass of equally average wine in some George Street bars. Not too shabby at all. Also, I don't know if they've recently had a big refurb but inside it is really nicely decorated. Unlike lots of traditional pubs in the old town, where \""traditional\"" means it still smells of the pre-smoking ban days and is always full of old men drinking pints of real ale, The Albanach has lovely slate floors and new polished wood everywhere.\n\nJust watch the step up as you go through the door on your way in. It catches me out every time and yes, everyone can see you."
3,"Stopped in this morning because a friend started waiting tables here.  Obviously the service was stellar as hers always is but because I have a bias I am not including it in my rating.\n\nGot seated out on the patio and it was a wonderful morning to do so.  Getting there early it wasn't very crowded. I noticed over twice as many cars in the lot when I left.  Whoever ordered the patio chairs never had to sit in them for very long.  They are sorta ok for setting back with coffee but a bit of work to set up to the table.\n\nSpeaking of coffee I had decaf.  For breakfast I had scrambled eggs, sausage, pancakes.  Eggs apparently got plated first as they were only lukewarm as the rest of the dish was still hot.  They honored my request to cook the sausage well.  I actually liked the thin pancakes, they were not doughy or over crisped and were still warm enough when I got them to finish melting the butter.\n\nThe Good Egg is not my favorite breakfast spot but it is ok and consistent across the chain.  And it is an Arizona chain."
3,"I came to Todai for lunch with my boyfriend since he was craving some Shrimp Tempura. Needless to say, he got plates and plates and more plates of Shrimp Tempura. \n\nFor $20 per person, there was a pretty good variety of food, mostly sushi rolls. There was also Salmon and Tuna Nigiri, salads, an udon station, and some desserts. Unfortunately, there was no crab during lunch. \n\nMy favorite part of the buffet would have to be the udon station. Just ring the bell, and someone will come out to make you a bowl. You can add fish cake, sweet tofu, green onions, and a few other things. As a warning, the broth is on the salty side, so I wouldn't drink it if I were you.\n\nWith the plethora of other buffets to choose from in Vegas, I don't think I would care to come back."
3,"My friend swore this was the best place ever for breakfast, true it is good and it does have some signature breakfasts, but the service is hit or miss...  sometimes you will get quick refills on coffee, other times you will sit there with an empty cup...  I still go frequently\n\nMy biggest complaint.. the price.. 2 eggs and some bacon shouldn't be anywhere near 6 bucks in my opinion...  there are good deals on the menu and bad ones..   I guess it depends on what you are in the mood for...\n\nOh and military discount???  Yeah you have to be in uniform to get it.. who in there right mind is going to be wearing their uniform on the weekend, and what does it matter if you are in uniform or not?!?!\n\nIf you go on the weekend, make sure you get there early, all the late nighters looking to cure a hangover will get there around 10 ish and the wait will be long, early yelper gets the worm!"
3,"It's ok.  I think they survive more on presentation, big portions, and name recognition than actual taste of food.  There are a bunch of better breakfast/brunch options in Vegas in my experience."
3,I used to come here when opened at first. I didnt come here.for about 2 year but one of friends want to try buffet so i came here to try.\n\nService is decent as always and their atmosphere is nice. However i dissappointed to food taste.. almost everything is salty and some of food is not taste right.. \n\nit was way better before.  \n\n\nDessets are always good!
3,My kids love this place.  Cool shirts and gear based upon cable shows and rock groups.  Obviously for a youthful demographic.  Sales people certainly represent that.  Prices seem reasonable for licensed items.  Quality seems good too.
3,I found decent prices here and I did feel a little out of my element I couldn't understand the names on their packaging. I bought some bamboo spoons for 35 cents each. I love wooden spoons for my tea.
3,"This is a Colombian restaurant, not Mexican. Very different menu than you will find in a Mexican restaurant. All very large portion entrees but you definitely pay for it. Being in the part of town it is in you would expect it to be inexpensive but that is not true. Entrees range from $13.00 to $25.00 but are, for the most part, worth it. I can only review one dish here as it is the only thing I have had here all 10+ times I've been. I always get the #25. Shrimp in coconut sauce over tostones (crispy fried green plantains) it has been fantastic every time. Their juices are great as well. Also, try the fried Yuca, it has a taste and texture similar to French fries. \n\nService at the restaurant is decent. Friendly staff and relatively fast service. I have only been there on slower nights so I cannot speak for their service on a busy night."
3,"Being from India, we eat Indian food several times a week both at home and outside the house.  Persi's has a great reputation and they didnt let down on our visit. Good food for a lunch buffet overall.  The selection is not big but it was all pretty good.  My favorite was the chicken tikka masala with white rice.  The chicken biryani was also good but it was a bit on the spicy side.  Intense flavors are good but the heat was a bit overbearing.  The desserts lacked as they only had gulab jumun and fresh fruit.  It was good but I was left wanting something more."
3,"This our 3rd trip to Vegas this year but 1st stay at Mandalay Bay. The 2 previous times were at The Hotel. \n\nMy only major complaint is the room/bathroom: Too cluttered with furniture, and the bathroom wasn't very clean. Some stray hairs in the tub and shower wall, and spots on the counter. \n\nThe Hotel is way better. All rooms are suites. Bathrobes and slippers provided (without asking, like at Mandalay) and bathrooms are clean."
3,"I was really excited about this place based on personal recommendations and yelp reviews. I've heard the dinner is amazing, and with such a high rating level, knew this would be a great place to take friends from out of town. However, we decided to go earlier in the day instead of for dinner.\nWent for brunch with 3 other people. Now, I understand that Charlotte is still working on their brunch scene compared to other cities, but brunch is brunch!\nThe food was cold, and service was slow. Our waitress was really friendly but very relaxed. She was attentive when it came to our coffee, but would disappear in bouts of 10-15 minutes. It wasn't very busy. The food was good, not great. I got the Breakfast Burrito. It was cold, and the cheese was hard. My friend really enjoyed the Shrimp Omelette, but did mention it was luke warm. Could be an attribute to our waitress performing Houdini disappearing acts. \nOverall, this place is good not great for brunch. It would be a place that if I had to have a fourth or fifth option for brunch, I might think about trying it again during this time. As to other times during the week/night,  I'm not giving up on this place! I've heard their Shrimp And Crawfish Etouffe and Bloody Mary Bar are as authentic as it can get. I will be back for dinner!"
3,"It's a good concept, circuit training.  It's go-go-go from the beginning so if you're not in great shape then this will be an eye opener.  We did 6 sets of 4 reps lasting about 3-4 min each throughout the 1 hr we did. \n\nLiked: TV monitors tracking your heart rate and the trainer was really nice\nDon't like: that you're constantly comparing yourself to others, and it can be distracting as you're trying to figure out if you're in the \""zone\"".  Which is not really a big dislike......\n\nI had a free class at 6:30am and it was packed on a Saturday morning with just one guy, about 15 people.  The gym itself is small and confortable feeling, and orange is the color which is vibrant and inviting.  They had a few things for sale but a little expensive.  \n\nThe program itself I think is too expensive, but I think it can work for people who like to do different things in their workout instead of just sitting at one station the whole time.  Good luck."
3,For the food I would have to give 5 stars.\n\nThe only problem is the shaky service.  If you to during lunch rush except very bad service.  Not sure why they can't hire another part time server.\n\nThere have been times that we almost had to leave because of the bad service.\n\nI have to admit that I keep coming back for the matzoh ball soup!
3,"took advantage of the coupons and got the chicken fingers. fast service and friendly. the chicken fingers were good,just be careful ordering hot! I still have much to try here so the jury is still out,but so far so good!"
3,"I was a bit disappointed because the service was not very good. Even from first entering the restaurant the service was not good. The decor and atmosphere is nice, especially if you can get a seat outside by the lake of dreams. The vegan food was delicious but nothing to rave about. The show which is played on the lake is quite cheesy. So all in all it was just ok. I was expecting better."
3,"Been a fan of this place through several names and owners. It's one of the few places in town to get a cigar, a pint of beer, and enjoy it inside.\n\nThe staff is very friendly, and they have a pretty good selection in their humidor. They carry a small but solid lineup of beers, including some of the local breweries. You can sit at the bar, grab a comfy chair, or sit at a table and watch the TV.\n\nMy only ding is for the atmosphere. Literally, the air. I like a cigar once in a while but am not a heavy smoker, and the smoke in there was on the edge of what I can stand. I had to fumigate my clothes when I got home. So definitely not for the weak of nostril."
3,"In search for late night prime rib, my friend who lives in Vegas brought us here. It was only $15. The place reaked of horses but it wasn't bad enough for us to leave. It was a good deal. The meal comes with soup or salad and your choice of potatoes. We all ordered it medium rare but was served a more rare one instead.  When we sent it back, they gave us a new one cooked to our liking. That was awesome customer service!  Although it was slightly chewy, the flavor and crust was really good! 3.5 stars total and yes I would probably come back."
3,"We were out and about, having just finished a late lunch/snack over at Il Bosco Pizza and Handlebar-J did not open until 4pm so we wandered over here to get a drink.  It was clean and has happy hour daily from 11am-7pm .  There are plenty of TVs to watch whatever sporting event is on.  We didn't order any food but they have an extensive menu."
3,"Yet another Groupon alert. I just can't say no when I see a place in my area offer a Groupon. \n\nThe place was just ok. I ordered the spicy chicken bowl and although I like the heat, I wasn't a huge fan of the flavor. It had a sweet flavor that I disliked and I wasn't a big fan of the rice. The shrimp tempura we shared was ok and the orange chicken and chicken teriyaki I tried from both my fella and my mom's plate were pretty tasty. I liked the texture of the orange chicken, despite not typically liking the orange sauce most places use.\n\nAll in all, it's a good little fast food teriyaki place. I'd recommend it for a quick on the go meal, but it's just ok overall. I'd probably go back, but only if I had another coupon."
3,"Cool for children... Not so much for adults. I came especially for the mummy exhibit and I was kind of disappointed. I liked the little computer stations that talked about Egypt and the actual mummy. Other than that, it was mediocre. I wouldn't recommend paying extra to see it."
3,"Not the greatest ale house in the city but certainly not the worst.\n\nI like the food and I have tried all the beers.  They're just \""OK\"" as far as beer goes.\n\nLarge portions. Friendly staff."
3,"Some of the best thin-crust pizzas in town - especially the wise guy!\nPrices are very reasonable - Service is friendly and attentive, yet inconsistent."
3,"Great tasting food, really, it is.\n\nProblem, disorganized, rude, lack of management, long waits for no specific reason.\n\nWilling to give it a second shot because the food is really good, but would recommend to ensure you have nowhere to go to afterwards because you may miss that event or appointment and they won't care, will still charge you and give you now deal, boo!"
3,"I love this airport... whether your arriving or departing, you move quickly.  I love how well organized parking and taxi/shuttle service is.... the taxi lines move quick.  Tons of shops, food, and slots to pass the time. Free wi-fi is a PLUS!"
3,Just your basic burger joint..  They do have a few other interesting things on the menu which I have not tried.  For the money I would rather go to Smashburger if it were closer.  I would eat here again because it is the best burger nearby for sure.
3,"My friends and I got a deal here and I was expecting the worse, but we got good. :)\n\nWe got an adjoining suite and the kitchen was well stocked for what you needed in vegas. The pool was heated, which made me want to come back. \n\nOtherwise, the place was kind of old. I'd come back here if I ever had a family and wanted to do the tourist thing."
3,"Not a bad deal - $40 for 2 people with two mimosas.   My husband and I ate to our hearts content - we got there at around 11am, and ate for what seemed like an eternity.  Since it was lunch time, we got a mishmosh of things:  crepe with everything (YUM!); gnocchi, salad, grilled veggies, dolmas, hummus and other dips, pita, all sorts of dessert and breads.  \n\nSeriously we had the worst food coma - I fell asleep in the elevator on the way back to our hotel.  I woke up four hours later to go get married. =)"
3,"Three of us lunched. waitress gave us samples since we were first timers. The meals were prompt, and they were not so expensive. My meal consisting egg foo young w/ red chicken and black bean was so so. I have had much better chinese than this. My friends had red chiken, friend rice, and pulled pork. They said they were ok. Do I go back......maybe one year later."
3,"Drinks are decent price. Honestly it's not the most divey spot but its cool. There's a DJ and small dance floor. No services to remember. The bar back was pretty tall and handsome so I felt fascinated. I danced, shook my butt everywhere- 4$ cover: meh! \n\nSome of the people in it looked 15 years old which was weird but hey I'm on Vacation. 6,50 CAD for jameson, jack, most beer. If your into more of the I need to feel hipster scene come here. Its a great place just young for my lifestyle."
3,"We frequent this bar every couple of months. Fairly clean place, friendly staff and decent bar food. We almost always come for the maple hot wings. One of the best flavored around!  However, they are usually  \""tiny\"" pigeon or Cornish hen sized pieces....but delicious.  \n  Great place to watch a game if you prefer a little quieter group of patrons. Its so nice not to have \""that guy\"" screaming at the TV sitting next to you."
3,"Yes the grand opening special $16 for AYCE krn bbq is great and all but its still not worth it in my book. \n\nFirst off, parking. IF this place ever gets off, where will all the customers park? Is everyone forced to carpool? because there are literally only 20 spots and its a cramped lot. Gotta fix that.\nSecondly, service. Our service didn't suck as bad as everyone else's but it was still bad. I mean the servers try to be nice and all but they did forget a couple of dishes. I also don't mind them cooking for us, however  much of our food turned out burnt. boo.\nLastly but most importantly, the food was just not that good. I really like strong flavors and both the marinated bulgogi and galbi were too bland for my taste. The other meats were also too dry and chewy.. maybe an indication that stuff wasn't too fresh? There was also a lack of variety in the AYCE appetizers. Sure gyoza and the steamed egg are good and all but I wanted more. I mean you're up against all the other AYCE krn bbq places in Vegas.. step it up yo."
3,"Solid variety of options, on the pricey side. We had sushi, chicken lettuce wraps, and a shrimp noodle dish. The food was good, but not quite authentic the way pan-asian places often are."
3,My favorite thing about this comic store is the fact that they just about always have a copy of something I'm looking for. They tend to order enough of books that come out. Other stores might be out but they will usually have some left. They have a bunch of figures and tons of books. Deforest will continue Coming in and maybe even subscribe for a box!
3,"I've always wanted to try this place and finally did. I ordered the cast iron skillet cornbread, which was good, then I had their smoked salmon hash which was just okay. My fianc\u00e9 had a salmon burger which he said was pretty good and the portion was huge!\nAlthough, I didn't feel the welcoming vibe as we walked up to the front. There were four people at the host stand and they were all just too busy doing sidework and chitchatting with each other but hey, we were fed in a timely manner so whatever and our server was nice and attentive. I should've tried one of their humongous burgers but there's always next time. I'll come back and give it another shot next time I'm in town."
3,"Letzte Woche bin ich mit einem Freund im Kikeri essen gewesen. Ging so. Das H\u00e4hnchen (worum es in dieser Gaststube haupts\u00e4chlich geht) lag mir mittelschwer im Magen und ich hatte auch w\u00e4hrend des Verzehrs nicht den Eindruck, dass hier auf qualitativ hochwertige Fleischware Wert gelegt wird. 3 Sterne f\u00fcr den angemessenen Preis und f\u00fcr die leckere, sehr scharfe Reisnudel-Suppe."
3,"Pizza and salad is good, but the service is average. Good place to hang out in evening just before after the movie!"
3,"Saw \""Oklahoma!\"" here a few years ago and enjoyed the show.  We also had the dinner buffet, which was OK- nothing to write home about.  I remember thinking that the desserts were the only items worth trying...\nIf its location just wasn't so out-of-the-way (back then I lived in Chandler!), I'd have been back many times by now, but I've only visited that one time.  Even now, I have a chance to buy 80% off gift certificates online, but it's a 28-mile drive from Scottsdale, so I think I'll pass..."
3,"So my girlfriend and I stayed at Aria and had a reservation for 2 months at The Steakhouse and the bubblehead woman at check in sat us at a horrible table so we will never go back.   If you don't take care of hotel guests, what's the point?   A group of 4 walked in with no reservation and sat next to us and complained about the table, so although our waiter was good and the food ok the experience was soiled by an idiot woman who sat us in Siberia.   Bad job!!!!!"
3,I've been to Gilbert pizza many times. It delicious... However the girl behind the counter is the rudest person I've ever encountered in my life. Walked in she looked right at me didn't say a word. Just continued to wipe down the entire counter before slowly walking to the register and just asking me what I wanted... I placed an order over the phone... She snapped at me saying it would be 5 more minutes. Seriously bitch? How much do u care about your job? Let's try a little harder... I'll take my money and spend it else where. Who let's their staff treat their customers like that? She was rude to every single person who walked in after me.
3,"I lied. After saying I'd never go back to Sports Authority convenience won out and I stopped in for a new pair of kicks. David sought me out immediately and was incredibly helpful, taking the time to understand what activities I was really going to be using the shoe for before directing me to three or four of his personal picks. He even talked me out of a more expensive pair of New Balance in favor of some discounted Asics, which I love. Checkout is still a bit of a mess but David's exemplary service warranted this updated review."
3,"Beware of the EBAY MAFIA and their evil friends...\n\nIf you are going to Last Chance there are a few things you should know:\n\n1. They have the best deals in town.\n2. You have little chance of getting these deals, as bitchy women and evil sleazoids plot to keep these deals away from regular consumers.   There is a group of \""team shoppers\"" who go to Last Chance every day. Their mission is to scoop up every piece of good clothing the minute the store opens. They work in teams to keep \""outsiders\"" out. They even work with unscrupulous staff members to keep regular people away from the best clothing. Many of these people even sell the stuff they score at Last Chance on Ebay.\n\nWant proof? Go to Ebay and search for things like Marc Jacobs purses or True Religion Jeans in Phoenix. You will see TONS of items from Lat Chance listed on Ebay. You know it's from Last Chance because of markings in the bags, cut tags on jeans and other things Last Chance does to prevent returns to Nordstrom.\n\nSo in summary - Last Chance would be great if the Ebay Mafia and their evil friends would stay away."
3,"Love the Nola food, the authentic and delicious flavor of this kitchen is unique In Las Vegas, had the Shrimp and grits so delightful, the bread pudding outstanding, is a carnival of flavors melting in your mouth, the service is not that great, waitress get lost for long time, you can see them chatting with hostess and have to wave many times in order to get their attention, I have been here tree times the soft shell crab is so crispy and delicious, the jambalaya, the gumbo so much layers of flavor, once again, you come for the food not for the service. But the food is so great, I'll be back as many times I'm craving New Orleans Food."
3,"It's like Korean and Japanese fast food. You can get sushi (its hard to get good sushi in Pittsburgh so by those standards, its pretty decent). You can also get the usual Korean fare: bulgogi, galbi, and kimchi. My favorite is the galbi bento (although its over $8 so I don't usually get it), or the bulgogi bowl. \n\nThe bento boxes come with a little bit of chap chae (Korean glass noodles), kim chi, a salad with \""oriental dressing\"", japanese yellow pickles, a few pot stickers (not bad, not good), and of course, whatever entree you ordered. \n\nThe bowls are simple: rice topped with meat. Yum! \n\nThe space is small though so its okay for 4-people groups."
3,"We checked out Primebar for the Phoenix Magazine Grand Opening event and I left with mixed feelings. I will say that they put on a nice event, with a free open bar (woo hoo!) and plenty of food, all tasty but nothing exceptional. Also, the service was outstanding...we didn't even have to go to one of the three bars for our second round of drinks, as a server came by to ask what we were having and promptly returned with them. My big problem is with the design...bland, boring, and corporate (which it is). The whole place is done in neutrals, with wood-like walls, a few Edison bulbs with metal mesh around them to pass as light fixtures, some mosaic tiling (still in neutrals), large neutral-toned pictures, flat screen TVs all over, and a mix of modern alternative and rock music. It's certainly not the sleek and sophisticated bar I imagined when they compared themselves to places like Blue Martini, Sapporo, and Ocean Club...it's more like a Yard House than any of those places. Great for watching the big game but not as a sophisticated watering hole."
3,---------DINNER ONLY------\nKicked off a work event with my co-workers here. The food was good but it wasn't memorable. It's loud and a great place to get together with friends (typical Vegas place). It's inside the Cosmo hotel on the floor with all the other restaurants. All the restaurants seem to have waits but this one never does. It's an okay place but I'd probably try another restaurant before coming back here
3,"My bf and I weren't a fan of this place. It's very loud and small inside. I ordered a mushroom and cheese omelette, bacon and a biscuit. Bf ordered a spanish omelet with salsa and home fries.\nMy omelette wasn't seasoned at all and lacked flavor. The bacon and biscuit were great tho. The bf liked his meal. The one thing we both agreed on was that the coffee was awful!!"
3,"This review will be an example of how the service staff can ruin a dining experience.\n\nLet me start by saying, we love the Wicked Spoon!!!  We try to make it in for a meal everytime we're in Vegas.  The food is great and they always have a new suprise on the menu.  The way they set up smaller portions in those cute little crocks is perfect.\n\nUnfortunately, on this visit, we got a grumpy old server with a bad memory.  Everytime we ordered drinks, she either had to be reminded of our order or she'd put the drinks in front of the wrong person.  We'd order a couple of cokes and a cup coffee.  She'd bring back 3 coffees and tell us \""Oh, someone at the table will drink them\"".\n\nBut the biggest buffet party foul of all is not clearing the plates quick enough.  We literally had to stack our plates at the edge of the table, while we watched her clear an empty table next to us.\n\nWicked Spoon, there are a lot of good people out of work.  Review the quality of your people and bring back the \""A\"" level dining experience."
3,"The Garage was once my favorite little spot but they're starting to seem pretty basic compared to all the other creative options out there. Nonetheless, they have good food and friendly staff. I've never had to wait for a table either which is great when you're starving or on a schedule but makes me wonder why more people don't come to this place? I wish they still had lamb as a starter. That would win my heart back right away."
3,"I want to shop local .  I appreciate the fact that my local purchase support local people. But I am not sure Next  is really interested in my business.  \nThe line on a Wednesday was 4 or 5 people in , which first made me think it must be a great place. but then after watching , I am think it's just a matter of workers who are interested in being helpful . They appeared to just leisurely make the orders with  little enthusiam or interest. When  I got to the counter I had a few questions . I was wonderfing about their holiday flavor , if it could be blended etc . But I felt as though getting info or suggestions was like pulling teeth. I felt embarrassed like I was inconvincing him but I then I remembered I was paying them to make my order.\nWhen the equally apathetic barista made my order she also refused to intereact or say anything to me. As I gave her my sweetest Polly Anna smile  she may have even grunted at me. I hate grunters.   Guess the big chain will get my bucks next time.\n\nPlease NEXT  make an effort to engage the customer and try using those nifty words , thank you , please and your welcome ....maybe even , glad I can help...."
3,"Met some people for McKoys for lunch and it was a good decision.\n\nI had the pulled pork sandwich and it was tasty and well priced.  Also, with a side of mac&cheese fill me up perfectly.    \n\n2 things to be on the look out here for.\n1 -  They won't seat you until you entire party is there.  I was 2 mins late to the door and had to make everyone wait to be seat.\n2 - Beware getting seat outside.  The traffic noise is really loud.  They need to install some more bush is some type of sound barrier.  It was hard to talk one another out there."
3,"I used to live in So Cal & Vegas, so all Asian food gets compared to those areas.  As much as I wanted to love this place, it only gets 3 Stars. \n\nThe portions here are pretty big and the flavors are unique.  \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/republic-ramen-noodles-tempe?select=ksAFcidCv_BmBaBXB8aXzw#ksAFcidCv_BmBaBXB8aXzw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/republic-ramen-noodles-tempe?select=qmZ7A6n_Is96cBXnDNw6Tw#qmZ7A6n_Is96cBXnDNw6Tw\n\nTheir idea of \""spicy\"" is really mild though....so for spice lovers, you'll have to supplement it with Sriracha.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/republic-ramen-noodles-tempe?select=hfn4x4jMbFl8pF73iXVUgQ#hfn4x4jMbFl8pF73iXVUgQ\n\nIt's not like a legit, Ramen place you'll find in other cities....but it will suffice until I travel somewhere I can get the real thing.\n\nReturn Factor - 65%"
3,"I'm not sure why this is called the Beatles lounge. The night I was there, they did not play any Beatles music. Which was FINE! with me.\n\nThey played a decent mix of music, however, no one was dancing. Except the go-go girl on the pole. We received a \""free\"" drink voucher when we got in, when you take it to the bartender inside, she turns down just about any drink you want, and gives you the \""acceptable\"" free drinks. You really need to read the fine print on your voucher. But OK, no worries.\n\nThere was a girl walking around with \""free\"" shots, that looked like they had cranberry in them. We declined. This place is GREAT for people watching. There were two older ladies.... I mean, OLDERRRR ladies, who were chain smoking and trying to rob the cradle.\n\nHilarious.... but don't come here if you want to dance--or hear the beatles."
3,The host was very rude when I walked up although I wasn't expecting amazing service from an airport bar. I asked her a question about the seating situation and she just shrugged her shoulders. She literally didn't say a word. I think her name tag said Della or something starting with a D. Once I sat down my experience here got better. A young lady by the name of Jack greeted me and took my order. She brought me back the wrong beer but quickly offered to fix my order. I'm not one to let drinks go to waste so I didn't make her fix it.
3,"I like this place a lot, good food, good service. Only thing I do not like at ALL, is the fact that they allow minors to be seated in the bar area. There is a restaurant portion with plenty of seating too. Really kills the vibe!"
3,"YAY!  Cheap food!   Corn dog was super good! Now I was a little intoxicated both times that I got it, but at 1:30 in the morning you can't beat the price and location!  Grab a corn dog and go into the casino and continue on, perfect!"
3,"First off, the view of the bellagio and the water show is AMAZING FROM HERE!!\n\nThe food here is just decent. You're paying more for the view and the fact you're on the top of las vegas in a qausi eiffel tower. \n\nDef worth the experience. Not sure if they have a bar up there, but i'd just get drinks up there if I could instead of eating"
3,"I am a big fan of the Aloft chain and the room and lobby were identical to the ones I have stayed in before. However, this hotel is very close to a busy freeway and my room was facing it. I heard the traffic all night. I could also hear the drive through speaker from the In & Out right across the parking lot. Still, I'd recommend to my fellow yelpers to stay here BUT request a room facing AWAY from the freeway or bring earplugs.\n\nThis hotel was very convenient for my recruiting trip to ASU and is an easy drive to Ikea and airport."
3,"These cupcakes have the look of cupcakes that are looked at.\n\nThey're very pretty in a well-bred Martha Stewart weddings way. They would look fabulous on a tray in quantity and variety.\n\nI like the prettiness. I like the restrained hand with the frosting. I like the frosting itself, which is unusual. I like the clerks. I very much like the toys!\n\nThe cupcake itself is such that, if I made it at home, I'd dub that batch \""experimental.\"" This cupcake was having an identity crisis but had not yet fully transitioned to muffin.\n\nI'd go back, if I'm right there, as the flavors are interesting, but I wouldn't make a special trip."
3,"If you have a choice, stay at the one about one mile farther north. (14245 S 50th St) The rooms are nicer, and they have indoor corridors.  Might cost an extra $10/night, but it's worth it."
3,"Was this place good? Yes. \n\nAre there a lot of better places? Yes!\n\nI had dinner here and we ordered the Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail and the Shrimp Spring Rolls as appetizers. The shrimp cocktail was exactly what I expected, cold shrimp with cocktail sauce.The spring rolls were actually really good and if I came back here I would start my meal off with an order of these.\n\nFor the main course I got the Crown Cut Bone In Filet Mignon, 12 oz. This steak really didn't do much for me. At this price point, I can go almost anywhere else for a better steak.\n\nNext time, if I'm in the forum shops and looking for a steak I'll probably go next door to Joes."
3,"The service is friendly.. and the ambiance is cool!  I love the outside benches where you can sit, have a beer, shoot the shit.... and just chill.  On a nice night, it's a really nice place to just BE.  \n\nThe waitresses are friendly... as well as the patrons.... \n\nI do believe that they serve food... though instead of ordering food, I ordered beer.  Beer was excellent.  hahaha!\n\nPrices aren't to bad either.... what I really dig about this place is the outside seating area.  I just like being outside.  \n\nThanks for the good times Al's!  I'll be back"
3,The Northlake Mall is a fairly big mall with lots of shops. As a guy the only down side it they are mostly women's clothing stores. The book store that use to be in the mall shut down. The mall is clean and has a decent food court. If you need clothing this is the place to go. If you are looking for electronics or gadgets you are better off going to the best buy across the highway.
3,"We recently gave San Remo another shot. I scored a solid, inexpensive breakfast while JK had a decent chopped steak and salad with good house-made blue cheese dressing. Our waitress was competent, friendly and on top of refills throughout our meal. I'm not a fan of the flat screens in every corner, but that can be a plus when you're dining alone - also they reduced the volume on the one closest to us as we requested. San Remo will probably always be a bit of a dive, but that's not a bad thing. Hopefully we'll continue to see improvements here and there at this low-key diner."
3,"Can be hit or miss. The tacos are usually pretty good and fresh, as are the breakfast burritos. Salsa seems to be more of a hot sauce... I'd say pick up a tub from Trader Joe's and pile that on instead. (Haha.) Chimichangas are a big NO, especially for ye of sensitive colons. I always get a big ol' awkwardly sized styrofoam jug of horchata that I can barely hold in one hand. \n\nOverall, don't expect a gourmet culinary experience. Also, just park and order from the window when there's more than two cars in the drive-thru or else chance attacking your sleeve, your friend, or yourself out of sheer desperation and hunger."
3,The food had a nice flavor to it. And I enjoy the fact that they serve breakfast all day. On the negative side of things; the wait to be sat was way too long. The server was mediocre at best and the food was cold by the time that it got to us!
3,"Okay, so I might not be the best person to review Brew Lab as I don't do coffee. At all. The whole coffee thing is properly lost on me. So a place famed for this particular beverage probably has to work harder for me. \n\nHowever, I liked Brew Lab when I could finally get some space to sit down and soak up the place. It feels a bit like a train station with people constantly wandering around trying to find a spot to sit, and it's rammed full of rich student types. \n\nI like the decor, the staff were very pleasant and my peppermint tea was really very nice. Fresh peppermint leaves and all. Lovely. Couldn't fault the cuppa - would happily sup another one.\n\nHowever, it's losing the fourth star for me just now because it's so busy and I don't find it very relaxing. If I want to enjoy a pot of tea I'd rather go somewhere a bit less packed. But hey, that's just a testament to how popular the joint is :)"
3,Comfy couches & low lighting really had me excited as we were celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary.  The music was okay but as soon as we ordered with a groupon for two Headhunter drinks the server couldn't be bothered.  Even though we had planned to order more we couldn't even get her attention to get a bill which we would have at least give her a tip.  I read the other reviews and had great expectations - maybe we should have sat inside where we could have tried various drinks.
3,"Eh. \n\nThat's what comes to my mind when I think about this place.\nI came with my dog and just opened the door to ask how I could enter the patio with my dog, as I couldn't see any access to the patio from outside. \nAs soon as I opened the door the hostess freaked and said \""No, No you can't bring a dog in here!\""\n....Lady, I didn't step foot inside and my dog is sitting calmly next to me.\nSo we proceeded to the patio and had our meal, which was pretty tasty. \nThe servers were clearly flustered dealing with a lot of tables at once so we didn't expect attentive service. \nAll in all, food was great, service was lacking, so I'm on the border about coming again."
3,"I have to admit the TB is a guilty junk food kinda thing when you are vegetarian.  Pretty much anything on the menu can be made vegetarian which is pretty great when you are in a hurry.  This location seems to be about the same as the rest. I'm not sure I can bring myself to give them 4 stars, but the food is what you would expect from the TB nothing life changing, but consistent.  The staff at this location are younger people as are most fast food places who always seem pretty cheerful.  I usually go through the drive-thru and they are always very polite and pretty quick.  Not lightening speed or anything, but I have never driven by because there were a few people in line ahead of me.\n\nSo basically they have very nice staff running the drive-thru so if you want some TB then this is a good one."
3,"I totally agree with some of you Yelpers that came from Cali...cause I was a So. Cal gal myself. Your paying twice as much for a sandwich that doesn't taste as good as Lee's Sandwich in L.A., but I'm getting to know Vegas and this place is the only place I know to get my Vietnamese Sandwich fix. Everything at this place is expensive. Was curious about the rest of the food from this restaurant so I brought my hubby back to try, I had the Banh Cuon (a soft rice roll with ground pork filling served with Yam chips/Vietnamese Ham/Shrimp green bean cake and bean sprouts), my husband had the Rice dish with BBQ Cornish Hen and Pho Dac Biet. I have to say...their foods are tasty because they put TONS of MSG in everything except the sandwiches. There was so much MSG in their food that it gave me a headache and I was so thirsty for the entire day."
3,"Today I just didn't like the chai tea latte...tasted watered down...didn't even drink half if it had to throw it out, just tasted gross"
3,"It's a nice little spot for locals, but the Orleans nearby is better for the vibe, including a nicer alley imo, and a theater.  Gold Coast caters to the Chinese with PingPangPong and the Noodle exchange along with the bacarrat"
3,"They are priced like they know they're the only game in town. The food is too expensive - $49.00 for a child and two adults, my husband had a $5 Guinness and I had a metered pour of $4 Pinot Grigio, not bad prices, then came the food. They served  my salad in a styrofoam takeout container with plastic cutlery, the miniature size of the salad dressing container was warning enough that a steep price would be paid for a second. It was a good salad and dressing the chicken I got on top had a lot of \""gristle\"" , the bacon was fine. My husband got Stromboli , ordinary but good, he got a real fork and knife and was served on a pizza sheet. Daughter got a cheese pizza.   It was 15 to 20 mins before our drinks came about 15 to 20 more for food. I really wish the place had actual dinnerware and was more appropriately priced, the bar is a great addition."
3,"Pros: My best friend was here for a visit from VA, where they don't have this fast food restaurant. She has actual cravings for their tacos. She loved them. I haven't eaten here in over 5 years. Ordered the sourdough breakfast sandwich and split it with my sister. We liked the curly fries. Fast service. \n\nCons: My sister disliked the potato wedges. Greasy fast food. I prefer McDonald's fries."
3,"Worth the money, but not too great.  All of the dishes were less than 10 dollars, and the portions are really big.  However, what you get is basically a bowl of noodles with very few vegetables and meat.  If you're looking for a cheap, filling meal this is a great place.  If you want good Asian food, look elsewhere."
3,"I ordered Take-Out.  I got the Masaman Curry with Tofu & Vegetables.. it was okay.  Not very note-worthy, but not horrible.  I wish I had gotten it for lunch, it would have been cheaper and would have come with more stuff.  I would return for lunch in or take-out to give them another try."
3,"It's worth a visit. ONE visit, at least.\n\nA lot of activity here, which is nice. That alone makes it worth the visit. Bands playing, scantily-clad women dancing. Too bad they looked so bored.\n\nZip lines are available (expensive) if you like that sort of thing.\n\nWe ate at two places here - the \""gourmet hot dog\"" shop and the \""middle eastern food\"" restaurant. Both were disappointing. Not terrible, but neither do I have a desire to return to those establishments. (What kind of middle eastern restaurant serves cheeseburgers?)"
3,"Dave's Dog House makes unique, tasty hot dogs. They have a delightful, back-east bun that's more like a piece of thick, foldable toast. The dogs are high quality and flavorful, and priced well. The fries are alright, but sadly nothing to write home about. \n\nThey've since moved ON campus, just off the Gammage Parkway loop, so it's a bit trickier to get to from Mill during school, but they're a much better dog than some of the other options available on Mill."
3,"Not my favorite club in Vegas. But after a while, every club is really the same. Came on a Wednesday night. Good crowd. Our cocktail waitress in VIP was very helpful and attentive to everyone's needs in our party. I like that LAX has a mezzanine area for some of the VIP booths, but every VIP booth houses two different parties which can prove to be problematic if the two parties conflict (which happened to us). The security attempted to remedy this by dividing the booth with one of the couches. The DJ was ok. I guess I would come back if I absolutely had to."
3,"This Boca Park Target Greatland was remodeled last year and is now just a regular Target, but has the expanded food format, so it includes fresh food with a really big grocery section similar to SuperTarget without the services like deli and bakery. It is much more appealing now that it has been given a red face-lift, but I'm still a little bitter that they removed Taco Bell Express. -2 stars because the team members here aren't as available or as willing to help as a typical Target, and this location is ALWAYS insanely busy. This has to be the busiest Target store in Nevada. They do have a really nice electronics section now though. Target Cafe on the left enterance with Pizza Hut Express, and store services include Pharmacy, Photo, and Portrait Studio."
3,"I really don't know what to say about the food except it's very average. \n\nThis restaurant was solidly average in many ways.  I got two lunch boxes (which consisted of meat, meat, meat and a side of stir fried rice...with meat). Besides the fact that it was super cheap and they conveniently deliver, I don't think I was satisfied.  The chicken with broccoli killed it for me, the chicken didn't taste like chicken...but like a lesser, mediocre version of chicken.  \n\nI'd definitely give this place another go because I'm cheap and lazy."
3,I was so hoping I'd love Port of Subs because they have so many locations in Vegas but I concluded it's only OK.  The service was good.  Helpful cashier and quick sandwich maker but the product ... meats and cheese were freshly sliced and tasty but the bread wasn't as substantial and wasn't as tasty as some other sandwich shops.  The prices are good but not so good as to overcome the feeling that you're missing out by not spending a bit more across the street.
3,"Food was the best part.  I would have given a 4 if the service was a little more engaging.  Then I went to the bathrooms (gross) and had to drop to 3 stars...  Nice to have a free miso soup, iceberg salad and fresh fruit at the end of the meal.  Has the potential for 4 to 5 stars...!"
3,"Nice store, seems a bit outside my usual area of town for shopping, but found myself over this side today, so I stopped in for a few items. Found the store to be almost empty with just a few people shopping, a lot of employee's stocking. \n\nI didn't find what I was looking for, it was probably seasonal with school supplies but took a chance to see if I could find it. Since I didn't, I took a look around at the few things I usually buy, like cat food, and music Cd's and found prices to be good, stock to be plentiful, and the lines at check out not crowded."
3,"I came here to sell some vintage items.  I didn't see very many vintage items in the store nor did they buy much from me.  However, they have a good selection of clothing.  It's not anything you would find at Goodwill or Plato's closet.  The clothing is unique and in very good shape. I found myself wanting every piece I picked up. However, everything seemed a bit overpriced. I noticed shirts were about $15+ and dresses $25+.  The store definitely has a young college vibe."
3,"I liked it because it was hip and modern. Maybe a little too \""night at the roxybury\"" if you know what I'm saying, with the weird blue nightclub lighting in the elevators and stuff, but still pretty fun. It would be fun to go there with a lot of friends since the bar and lounge is huge and would accommodate. The room size was a little small. The food was terrible. The wi-fi didn't work in the rooms and it was annoying to have to go to the lobby to use my laptop. I didn't want to bother with the customer service phone number just to use the wi-fi...and the ethernet didn't work either. How does wired internet get so confusing? It certainly shouldn't."
3,"Ok first off let's get past the fact that I'm knocking on 30's death door and still going to see bands like My Chemical Romance, where the core audience is teens. Look at me kiddies, I'm old enough to drink, and I have a beer! Wooooooo ahhhhhhhhh.\n\nThis location seems like the slimier, dirtier, slutty sister of the Disney infused Anaheim location. There is only one level at this one, due in part I'm sure, to the fact that it's in Mandalay Bay. However, there are 3 full bars at all corners of the stage, and a sunken in dance, GA floor.\n\nThere was this one time, not in band camp, where my BFF and I were having a drunken girl's night with a stop here. Oh wowwie, after downing some shots to try and forget the fact that a couple in their late 50's wanted to have a \""party\"" with us, we ended up on stage doing the African Ant Eater Ritual dance from \""Can't Buy Me Love\"". You remember that movie right? The one with McDreamy, before he went all, dreamy"
3,"I would come back. \n\nI don't live in Vegas though. My sister and her family took me here before they dropped me off on the strip. It's not too far from the strip. The food is descent for the rice. We mainly ate the bul-go-gi and the marinated pork. They have jap chae along with all the little kimchi sides. I went during lunch so I'm not sure if they put more out for dinner. They have this rule where if you waste food, they will charge you $5 or more. So make sure you eat everything on your late or else you'll be paying more! You pay after so there's no way to avoid it. \nIf you want something asian and are willing to venture off the strip, I would say come here and enjoy some korean food. You get to cook on the table!"
3,"Went for lunch.  Had great,attentive service.  Got the artichoke sandwich and found it to be so-so.  Just not a lot of stuff on it - mostly bread. Monty's Blue Plate Diner has far superior artichoke sandwich. I really enjoyed the coleslaw side though.  My friend had the cubano sandwich and said it was good.  Waiter explained it was made of pig jowls so it's leaner. The description kind of grossed me out, but I was pleased that he was so knowledgeable about the menu.  I'm hoping to try it again sometime for dinner and cocktails. Overall, lunch didn't impress me but there was nothing specifically wrong with it either."
3,"My first time in Vegas, and its for a conference (work related).  \n\nConference area:\nThe distance from my room to the conference room was at least a mile. I thought I was doing a half marathon. I was looking for people passing out Gatorade. I really didn't have to go to the gym my whole stay in Vegas. Be sure to bring gym shoes.\n\nThe food that was available in the conference room was delicious. Breakfast was hearty, and lunch was basically dinner because the portions were so huge. There was a lot of choices so you weren't bored. Con for having good food was getting so sleepy after the meal, and trying to stay awake during the 2nd half of the conference.\n\nCasino:\nMy stay at the Rio was on a weekday, so it wasn't packed. A variety of tables and slots to choose from. I  didn't gamble much at the Rio. I went to the strip for that. Free Shuttles to the casinos that are under the same company as the Rio was nice.\n\n\nThe room was nice. I just wish they got rid of some outdated features. Had an old CRT TV, but who has time to watch tv while in vegas? No wifi in the rooms. Had to use an Ethernet cable. There was wireless in the conference area though.\n\nOverall, a good experience because it wasn't on my dime. =) Just the gambling."
3,"Good customer service, and they did a good job tailoring my suite. Parking is easy, you can be in an out quick, and the store does not smell horrid...But who the hell is going to read a review on Mens Wearhouse?? You know what you are getting with this place"
3,"I enjoy the food here. Straightforward concept like Chipotle and the like. I am a big fan of the nachos here. The three cheese sauce is delicious and has a little spice. I enjoy the salsa here, always seemed fresher than competitors. The burritos are pretty standard, and always consistent. My only real concern is that on veggie nachos or veggie burritos you have to pay more for fajita veggies or rice (only on nachos). Seriously? I am already not getting meat, which means that it is already cheaper to make. Other than that, this place will stay on rotation. \nThis Qdoba is always very clean, not really too busy, and the service is typically pretty decent."
3,"I wish I loved the food as much as the views and atmosphere. Breads were good, especially enjoyed peanutbutter butter. Shrimp cocktail had a fun twist. The beef tenderloin and cod were good. The MiX candy bar was a tasty dessert. Service was a bit snooty, but otherwise good."
3,"Does anyone actually shop here?\n\nMy husband and I were staying next door at Aria and wandered over to see what this mall was all about ... and it's all about High End Things for Rich People. Now, I didn't go there expecting to see an Office Max, a Lane Bryant, or a combo KFC / Taco Bell in a food court, but I hoped there may be -some place- I might feel comfortable walking in to and at least browsing. \n\nNope. It was all super high end, and I saw very few people actually in those stores shopping. Most people were just wandering through (like we were) on their way to somewhere else, or gawking at the fabulous architecture and art installations. The only place we found that looked like it didn't require an American Express Black Card to enter was a place humbly called The News Stand, tucked away downstairs under the escalator near a (presumably) rarely used entrance, like the fabled red-headed stepchild. \n\nThe only reason I'd ever go back would be to grab some bottled water from The News Stand, maybe get a coffee at Starbucks, or just enjoy the A/C and the art on my way to The Strip."
3,"Food is awesome the chicken and steak tacos are very close to Mexican street style maybe better and the chicken soup is the best. I eat hear alot but recently had a bad experience in drive thru and inside, employees don't know how to split orders and the guac sauce i asked for never made it in my bag and i didn't have time to go back as i was on a lunch break"
3,"I don't get what all the fuss is about. First off, figuring out where to order and where to get food is very confusing.  On top of that,  drinks are ordered in a separate line entirely,  adding even more to the confusion. They charge the same prices as a sit down place,  yet no one serves you.  And lastly, the food was just OK. I got the avocado pizza and it was just OK, nothing special.  The pizza was super greasy and I couldn't figure out what cheese they use,  but it wasn't mozzarella.  The dough tasted like it was sourdough,  which I'm not a fan of. I wouldn't come here again unless I have no other choice."
3,"Came here the other night for a friend's 21st birthday. I've been here several times and it's a bit hit or miss for me. I think it largely depends on my mood. \n\nPRO's: Awesome for people watching as there are usually a good combination of \""interesting\"" people mixed with beautiful people. Prices aren't outrageous and I've never paid a cover charge here. The atmosphere is fun and upbeat. A good place to amuse young (21-23 year olds) friends/relatives. \n\nCON's: A little on the douchey side at times. I don't know if it's more unique to Scottsdale than the bar itself but be prepared to be scrutinized openly by other patrons. Also, it's one of those bars where the music is loud but there's seemingly a lack of dance space. Most people congregate by the front to dance which is somewhat awkward. Also, be prepared to wait an eternity for a drink. \n\nOverall, this bar is okay if you're literally looking for an \""Old Town\"" experience such as a 21st birthday but not really one of my favs. I don't hate it but I don't love it either."
3,"Well, I really wanted to love this place based on the reviews, but it's a solid 3 stars.\n\nService: 5 star all the way, BUT the server totally screwed me on my wine choice.  I asked for a \""house\"" wine, which almost always means the cheapest, well, not so much.  Got the bill and each glass was $13.50.  YIKES!!!  So, he went from 5 stars to 1 star based on that alone.\n\nFood:  Good to very good.  I had the osso buco..not the best ever, but definitely nice.  The insalata bianca I had b4 this sounds great, but it was just okay....nothing to write home about.  My husband got sea bass special.  The flesh was chunky and beautifully grilled.  It was served with a bland spaghetti squash....WHY do people keeping pushing squash...people want to convince you it's good, but it really is never good.\n\nPrice:  Not bad, but we were definitely stung by the upsale of the \""house\"" wine.  \n\nOverall 3 is it, could be 4, but that was lost at $13.50/glass"
3,"With a large group you need to lower your expectation a bit since they are working on good service and they limit the menu.  Choice of Salad or soup and I went with an onion soup with Gruyere cheese that was very good.  The main course was a choice of Prime rib, herb Chicken or Salmon.  I really wanted to the Salmon but is was to be mostly rare and U like it cooked.  The Chicken was ok, but it came with string Fries?  Who serves string fries for a formal dinner group?  \n\nAgain service was good, drinks were over priced and the food was ok!"
3,"Stopped in for a pint and a burger after a Friday Night run with the Charlotte Runner's Meet Up group.  Place is huge, with an outdoor patio and three floors of bar / restaurant space.  Lots of beers on tap - at least six local brews - as well as just about any mixed drink you could want.  I tried the Ghost Burger with the sweet potato mash.  Actually preferred the mash to the burger - the bacon slices in with the sweet potatoes were quite tasty!  The Ghost Burger itself was spicy but not outrageous.  A bit overcooked, but the grilled onions on touch were a nice touch.  Waitstaff was not great, but it was a Friday night so they probably were just prepping for a long night.  Prices were high - spent $20 for a burger and beer.  Would expect to pay about $10-15 for the quality of the food served."
3,"After pigging out at the Wynn buffet for lunch we just wanted something simple and quick for dinner. We came here as it is my mom's preferred pho place in town. It was ok. Summer rolls lacked any mint, the veggie sides were only some bean sprouts, sad looking basil and a few slices of jalepeno.  But then we were in the middle of the desert not SoCal or Hawaii.  The broth was ok and overall just ok."
3,"I'll be perfectly honest.  I probably never would have gone here if it had not been for my husband's coworkers.  College bars just aren't my scene, living in Boston will do that to you.  But given it was the summer and we were in a group of 50 I thought it would be ok. \n\nWe took over the whole back part which was nice.  The drinks were well made and I'm assuming cheap.  They have two pool tables in the back, which are slightly awkward given their close proximity to the bar.  The music was fairly generic ranging from your classic drunk girl anthems (Pour Some Sugar on Me) to current Top 40 hits.  My husband enjoyed the bathroom attendant, whom he swears must have be related to Lil Jon, saying things like \""Get yo piss on!\""  \n\nThey have a \""no pictures\"" policy which I found to be incredibly lame.  You can't snap a picture of you and your friend having a good time without their written permission?  Really?  Guys, its not that impressive of a place that you have to try to keep it secretive.  I've actually never experienced something like that before and most of the places I frequent are a lot nicer than this.\n\nWould I go once classes start in the fall? Heck no."
3,"I was looking for a place that served Gyro's and this place serves them. I ordered mine to go so I cannot comment on the wait service but the taste of the gyro meat was pretty good. I was a little put off by the overall condition and cleanliness of the place, I did not see any bugs but would not have been surprised if one came strutting out of the back at any moment. It just didn't look clean and although I did like the Gyro, I have decided not to return because I have a feeling it is not very clean and that means the food is probably in nasty conditions in the back, I would suggest they clean and make the place look better with some nicer furnishing and maybe some paint and bleach. Just sayin'."
3,"Ugly exterior. Nicer than expected interior. Stay here as cheaper get away experience, does the job I suppose. Didn't stay here, visited a friend. That's pretty it."
3,"We ate at La Porte Grecque as part of a party of 40 (dinner after a baptism). The location of the restaurant and the ample parking made it ideal for group events. There were 2 indoor sections and 1 outside section allowing for lots of options. We were in the larger of the 2 indoor sections.\n\nService was good considering the size of our party. We were offered a nice menu and they happily accommodated any dietary concerns with off-menu items. \n\nThe food was just ok. The starters were small but tasty (choice of feta and olives (2 whole olives...), tzatziki or vine leaves (3). The mains were big but the food was pretty dull. Desert was a cake. \n\nThe restaurant is a BOYW joint which is nice."
3,"Service is seriously lacking... took 35 minutes at lunch to get a negi-toro roll and a philadelphia roll (and they weren't that busy!). Guests seated across from me who showed up 20 minutes after me were served first. UGH.\n\nService aside, the sushi is decent. Not great, but decent. It's definitely fresh, but the rolls were sloppy and big and didn't seem rolled up well. Prices were alright. I did find the lunch specials to be lacking. No sushi option (unless you count 4 pieces of a cali roll as \""sushi\"") and not much variety. \n\nSooo I love sushi has way better prices, fish, and rolls. However, I work near Sushi Fever instead of I love sushi. If I love sushi were anywhere nearby, I'd never go to this place again."
3,"So I had the Com bi cha suon nuong.  The pork chop was tasty, well flavored and not overly salty.  The bi was good although I didn't care for the meatloaf (cha) because the edge was too firm as though it was left in the oven a tad too long.  overall I had a good lunch."
3,"I've been going to hair pollution or about a year now and I like it, but I don't love it--i think it's probably time for me to move on. i love the atmosphere and most of the stylists are super-friendly. I love julia she reminds me of one of my best friends from home which is probably why i've continued going there as long as I have. \n\ni got a last minute appointment with megan after many weeks of out-growth and really stubby un-cute ponytails. julia was out in NYC being schooled on the world of bumble & bumble, which the salon is now exclusively using since june (which I think may have bumped up their prices because my cut was 50% higher than usual. that's fifty.) Megan was very friendly and easy to talk to, but i felt the cut was less meticulous than i have previously received at the salon and I ended up re-straightening my hair when i got home before i left to class.\n\n I think i like the cut, but styling was a little more soccer mom (which really surprised me) than funky, fun, 21 year old which I like to think is more me! I would say my main reason i will probably start going elsewhere is I keep waiting to walk out of the salon, feeling awesome & sexy, but I've never had that moment here, so I'm going to keep searching."
3,"I really wanted to love this place so much - love the concept, service was great, space is intimate, and the food was good.  unfortunately, the price point is way off here and is not aligned with the market.  this is not to say the food was bad, just that it's way overpriced for what you get.\n\nthe cheese and charcuterie plate was woefully tiny for $18, and did not seem fresh.  between my friend and i, we had the lamb bolognese and cassoulet.  both were good, but not worth $24 each.  also, the portions were on the smaller side.  we also had the russian honey cake which was good but would've been better had it been fresh - it was still a little cold from the fridge, and you could just tell that it wasn't freshly made.  for what we got, our dinner should not have cost as much as it did.\n\ni get that it's a small operation and a fairly new business, but they would be better off building a loyal customer base for reasonably priced, elevated comfort food, rather than overcharging to meet costs and discouraging some from going back.  another observation makes the point - the place is cheaply furnished and the utensils are cheap.  i have nothing against ikea, but eating a $24 entree with tin/aluminum utensils is incongruent.  there's a time to cut costs and a time to invest, the trick here is to figure out the right formula."
3,"Interesting Concept. Build-your-own sushi roll. I like that you can choose what goes into your sushi, but you're paying too much for low quality ingredients. They're also a little skimpy on the fish and meat. The rolls are pretty large but it's mostly rice. \n\nEverything is mechanized. They use machines to spread the rice, cut the sushi, etc. That's pretty interesting to see. This place is located in a college town and that's who they're catering to, so I guess you can't expect too much."
3,They nailed exactly what they are trying to do hear with Scandinavian food. Problem is that it's not the right genre for me. Poutine was lights out though.
3,"Meh. \n\nThe food was different, I will give it that. I ordered the reina and the chicken arepa. They tasted like a stuffed sopapilla (sort of). I guess I was expecting something else..HOWEVER, their orange drink was awesome."
3,This place is probably great for a lot of people but I didn't care for it. I had the enchilada omelet and it had nasty American processed cheese on it I guess that's what they use for omelets and that probably doesn't bother most people but It makes me gag.. Ew on the menu it says jack cheese but it should add that it's processed. Anyways enough of the cheese rant. The service was good and the coffee cake was really good.
3,"Was hoping for more.  Service was ample though kinda felt fake all around, and while most preparations were adequate, I would not laud the kitchen by any means."
3,"The food was okay.  It didn't send my tastebuds to another dimension, but it was good. I ordered the blackened salmon -which needed ask me type of sauce to make it taste better.  The waiter gave me maple honey to try, which gave it a little more taste. I asked if he had anything else....he gave me the marinade that they use on their wings.  It was a combination of soy sauce, pineapple juice, and orange juice.  This combined with the maple butter gave it what it was missing.  The fried okra was really good.  I also got Mac and cheese which had a little kick to it.  They stated that it was made from scratch so I was thinking that it would be something baked.  \n\nOverall, the food was okay, the service was good, and I would give them another try, but would want to try some other recipes of course."
3,"Wanting a change from the Half Moon for some Sunday Night Football, i sought out another sports bar in the 85016...  Teakwoods was the answer.  Lots of TVs.  Average service.  Extensive Menu.  Good drink specials.\n\nThe Good:  For bar food, nice menu... the Jess Jess wings were pretty good.\nThe Bad:  The beer list is dreadful.\nThe Ugly:  God only knows whose nasty fingers have been in those buckets of peanuts.    \n\nThe crowd was the best part of this place... it was absolutely eclectic.  \n\n5 drunken frat boys\n4 suburban gangsta's\n3 hipsters with the raybans \n2 goth chicks on a date\n1 TwentySomething daughter arguing with her cougar mom about how many martini's she'd had (\""mom, i swear thats your 4th one, why would i lie, i drove separate?!\"")  \n...And a partridge in a pear tree... Teakwoods has it all!   \n\nBeer: D-\nFood: B\nSports Watching: B+\nPeople Watching: A+"
3,"I find enough of what I need there, but it's smaller than other Whole Foods I've been to and their selection and variety isn't as good as other Whole Foods I've been to. \n\nThey have a good gluten free selection.  \n\nIt's hard to find stuff sometimes. Whenever I go in there, even though it's really small, it takes a long time for me to find what I'm looking for. Half the time, I don't find most of what I need, which is frustrating.\n\nExpensive...they all are. Overpriced, honestly."
3,"Watched a preseason laker game here against the sacramento kings and it was a fun experience as we pretty good seats.\n\nUpon arriving I told the attendant we had tickets and she pointed us in the line to purchase tickets which was rather long.  We stood in line for about 10 min before asking again to make sure and this time she said we didn't have to stand in line and we can just go in, wtf man what a waste of time!\n\nLines for food and drinks were rather lengthy and took awhile."
3,"The only street level spot for morning coffee on First Avenue between Fillmore and Monroe.   The lights were on, the OPEN sign too.  I had a few minutes before my appointment with a Very time-fixated appointment coordinator.  Coffee Time!\n\nOpening the door, I walked into a clean hive of sound and energy.  GaGa's techno pop driving busy bees making a sandwich tray for somebody's event, prepping for lunch, serving breakfast, and generally revving up for a busy Tuesday at the Hero Factory.  \n\nThe coffee was my style of Americano - Folgers or Farmer Bros.  Vacuum pots, sweeteners and stir sticks on a small south wall table.  Half and half and milk were in the cooler.  Help myself, pay my dollar, find a sunny table for sipping and dumping the chaff from my e-mail.   \n\nThe past three years a lot of downtown Phoenix restaurants have been raked from the streets like dead leaves after a dust or thunder storm.  Places I've seen for years and patronized occasionally stand empty, waiting for new  cheftrepreneurs.  Other places, pruned hard by the economy, live and serve. An energetic beehive like Hero Factory is great to have around.  Nicole invited me back for lunch.  I'll do that, and bring some friends.  Maybe I'll order a sandwich tray instead, bring it to work, invite everybody and goober up the conference room table with breadcrumbs, lettuce fragments, onion snippets, mayo and mustard.  I'll be back for a rewrite no matter what."
3,"My Husband and I took my Grandma here for the first time this past Mother's Day (I know sorry for the late review).  I was really pleased that they took a reservation for the day because I've heard there can be a long wait.  Upon arrival we were greeted and seated quickly (after they cleared the table).  Our waitress was prompt and nice.  Overall, I like the decor, but the atmosphere felt very crowded and overwhelming to me... maybe it was just because of the holiday.\n\nI ordered the crazy biscuits, which I didn't love.  It was very heavy, which was obvious that it would be, but the taste didn't blow me away.  The Hubs had pancakes, which were really good.  My Grandma had the hash, which I didn't try, but she loved.  Based on this experience alone, I would go back considering so many people love it.  I would probably try something completely different though."
3,As a true foody. I think fast food lobster does not gel well. Like reading a book in a rain storm........ But to my surpise it was actually very good I mean the bloody mary lobster shot was interestingly tasty and the lobster lolly pops are very nice. Price is about right. Conclusion- try it people and be surprised. Very surprised.
3,"Good food and service but very pricey! if your willing to spend then its a good place to eat , 30$ alll you can eat you choose your own side dishes which are alright. the Bulgogi is there best meat and the short ribs. Service was great very helpful and they love helping you cook the meat. The reason i gave it a three was that at the end of the meal after paying 100$ for three al you can eat , the cashier/server harassed me why didn't i leave a tip that it was mandatory ,which was very unappreciate i was going to leave the tip but the fact that i was told i had to made me not do it"
3,"Trevi is nothing extraordinary, but is quite yummy and only a litte overpriced. I got the cheese ravioli which was pretty delicious but didn't need to be $20. However, in Vegas, Trevi is quite affordable and nicely located in Ceasar's Palace. \n\nI do strongly recommend getting the Polenta Fries. I'd never seen such a cute, creative way to serve polenta, (shaped like french fries with marinara sauce to dip it)."
3,"Food was really good, as expected, but be ready to spend quite a bit. You really are paying a price premium for the reputation of the place. \nAlso, my girlfriend told me there was alcool served, so I was really motivated to spend a good portion of the night there, but they really offered only 5-6 beer types and all in bottles.\n\nI would recommend it if you are in the area, but I would not recommend you to travel a medium to long distance to go there."
3,I went in one time and had terrible customer service... Went in another and it was really good! Thanks Mariah. I think that's what her name was.
3,"Old school mexican restaurant.  Food was good,  no beer, A/C was marginal.  Not for those looking for the chain restaurant atmosphere.  Very traditional.  I'll visit again when the weather is cooler."
3,No doubt a popular venue as judged by our wait even after we had a reservation. \n\nAte my usual bone in filet and was utterly disappointed. In fact I was underwhelmed by every dish that came out.  \n\nI guess I should have gotten the seafood?
3,"When I went to BRGR, I got The Button Buster. I'll have to say, I was pretty excited because this looked like an awesome burger. However, I was a little disappointed. The braised short ribs on top of the burger were quite fatty and unappetizing. I took off the remaining short ribs and finished more of the burger. I wish that it would have come with a side as well. Overall, if I go here again I will definitely get a different burger."
3,"I've only been here for breakfast and I must say it is damn good. The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars because I'm not such a fan of the atmosphere for the morning. At 9am I don't want to hear techno music and I much prefer a relaxed atmosphere with a simple menu; not 18 different omelette!\n\nAlthough if you want a fancy breakfast and enjoy the hectic atmosphere, this place is definitely better than Eggspectation, so give it a try!"
3,Great service from Christian. The truth is sometimes I just want good old WT food. The food is greasy and good. To many people want to rate places by comparing them to one of the best steakhouses. I try to rate it for what it is. It's a good place to go for some good greasy food. I enjoyed everything I had there!
3,The food is excellent but the service leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  Definitely not a kid friendly place.
3,"Pretty good juice. Just make sure the machine is clean before getting your juice, or it will taste like the last persons juice. Yuck! Also the manager \""girl\"" should watch her mouth. She should not be yelling and talking down to employees in front of customers Rude!!"
3,"I think Bouchon probably deserves 3 stars based on my first visit, but I'm willing to give it another try. It is a very pretty dining room and the atmosphere was really nice. My boyfriend and I went for brunch on a Sat. We ordered chicken and waffles, steak frites, 1/2 dozen oysters, and cocktails.\n\nJust briefly...\nBread and butter: awesome soft butter...hard bread\nOysters: really fresh but specify what types of oysters you want to your waitress\nChicken and waffles: pretty good but nothing out of the ordinary\nSteak frites: good\n\nMy only compliant, which isn't really a complaint because the staff was really nice...is that I wish we were served by one person only so that's it's more consistent and timely. We had our waitress and different servers who delivered each of our items. Our items came at odd intervals. There was a big gap between the bread and butter and our oysters, our main dishes didn't come at the same time...and when I asked the waitress if my drink was still coming after we had started our dishes, she seemed genuinely surprised it hadn't. Maybe it's because the bartender delivers the drinks himself? I'm not really sure, but that would be my only suggestion, one person to take care of everything or better communication."
3,"Don't get me wrong, steiner's is one of my favorite places but, the \""hashed browns\"" served this morning were horrible!  It was like a paste that was smeared onto the griddle & cooked.  So sad"
3,"Say what you want about this place and shut up with the 'authentic' argument already- their chicken parm is BOMB! I don't care if purple people from china made this italian chicken, it doesn't lose it's credibility of flavor. at least not for me.\n\nhowever, they lose 2 whole stars for price and dumb menu. seriously $20 for two chicken breasts? and nothing else? stupiddddddddd.\n\nthere are no other options for dinner either, its like get this huge plate of chicken for an overpriced amount, or nothing else. i personally opt for the kids meal- 1 chicken breast and side of spaghetti @ $6. that's more like it.\n\nevery window has a light up sign that say things like 'italian dinner' or 'come eat' or something. one of them says 'health inspected'. that is the weirdest thing i have ever seen. it just makes me wonder why it is necessary to point out that it is health inspected???"
3,"Something is just missing at this place compared to other dim sums I've had. Service was pushy to start. They kept rushing us to order when we were still waiting for our entire party to be seated. I liked the custard buns, shumai and duck. Don't waste your time or money on the lobster pasta. The lobster was good, but the noodles were bland and forgettable. Not a fan of them having to take the food to the back to be reheated before serving, either. I probably wouldn't go back, there are better places to have dim sum."
3,"Feel like the food and drinks are overpriced, the food is good, but for the amount and type of ingredients feel it's too pricey. Have had inconsistent service so can't really comment on it, once it was pretty good, the other two times I've been it felt like it was a bother to them to serve and there were only two other people inside."
3,great for people watching or sitting with a drink while waiting to be seated at le provenal.\n\nthe gelato is refreshing but the food is on the junk food side. service is slow.
3,"My standard for Vietnamese food maybe a little high given the fact that I lived in SoCal about a 20 minute drive from Westminster/Little Saigon.\n\nWhile the service here is very good for an asian restaurant, and the restaurant itself is clean and modern compared to most vietnamese restaurants, the food was just OK. I ordered the Grilled Pork and it was too fatty and salty (even for me who likes to eat salty) :-("
3,"The chicken shwarma is quite good for the price, tucked into a large soft pita and filled with not greasy and better than average quality chicken. The owner is indeed a real sweetheart. You might want to get it \""to go\"" because the seating isn't that great, but it's a good bang for your buck. I'll try the gyros next!"
3,"I begged my husband to come here prior to returning our rental car due to the reviews. If I was only reviewing the maple donut, I would say 10 stars out of five. The maple donut is absolute perfection - crispy on the outside, moist and cakey on the inside, and everything a donut should be. Next on my list in order of flavor was the cinnamon crumb donut, which was also pretty good. I tried the apple fritter based on the reviews here but found it entirely too greasy, almost as if it had been double-fried, and way too sweet. I could only take one bite. The coffee was also pretty bad. I think one other reviewer described it as \""diner style\"" which I didn't realize was an insult until after I drank it. I'd come back here every week for maple and cinnamon crumb donuts, and maybe to try the old fashioned glazed, but I definitely wouldn't get the coffee or the apple fritter again."
3,I had a really bad experience back home with buffalo wild wings but we decide to give it another shot. Nachos were good the wings were ok they were a little dry for my taste. so compare to my back home experience I will say this is a better spot. One thing is for sure Sunday football this place is crazy crowed.
3,"Nice hotel, all the amenities you need, great complex of pools. Just make sure your room is as far from the Vista Lounge as possible; otherwise you'll be bombarded with crappy live music, fully audible from the lounge to all the surrounding rooms above it, for four hours a day. Horrible.\n\nThe Internet access is not free, which is lame.\n\nThe room service is good but overpriced by at least 40 percent. So it goes with resorts.\n\nOtherwise a very nice hotel."
3,"I came here for a networking/informational dinner. We started with cheese curds because this was my first and only time in Wisconsin, and I heard that you can't visit without trying the cheese. We told the waitress to surprise us, so I don't know which ones she surprised us with, but they were decent. A girl in the group said that they were the best she has ever tried, but I don't really have a standard to compare this with so I have no clue.\n\nI ordered the scandinavian style chicken dinner, which was a half chicken rubbed with cinnamon/cardamom/juniper, with mashed potatoes and stuffing on the side. Everything was decent but nothing about my meal stood out to me.\n\nLovely decorations"
3,"Cali-style men's and women's clothing.\nMen's tanks, board shorts, tshirts, jeans and shoes.\nWomen's dresses, shorts, tops, shirts, swimwear, jeans, and shoes.\nAlso, lots of brands to choose from like Brandy Melville, Volcom, Billabong, Quicksilver, Vans and some Nike SB shoes. They have cute accessories, too!\n\nThe store is pretty big and quality of clothing is pretty ok.\nDefinitely a store for teens, or skinny people (lol) .. \nI like a few things, but a little over priced if you ask me!"
3,"Not bad! Nice decor with cute serving dishes. I ordered the triple B burger, almost $20 (you pay for the name) but wasn't really worth the $20. Our hostess ignored us for while (with no one else waiting) before seating us and our waitress gave really poor customer service, however our runner was great and should've been our server! \n\nIf we want a great burger we'll just go to Bachi burger and get a grass fed burger for $8 cheaper! All in all, I'm glad we tried but we probably won't eat here again due to the high prices and not so attentive staff."
3,"The Flamingo is what it is:  one of the original strip hotels trying to keep up with the never ending crop of new, ultra-modern hotels.  The flamingo succeeds on some levels:  full amenities, clean rooms, recent redesign.  It mostly fails though.   Service is poor, casino floor is dingy, the rooms are not up to par with neighboring hotels, and dining/nigh life offerings are poor.  Margaritaville is a nice try, but it comes off as dated and cheesy.  \nFlamingo is centrally located though and the rooms are nice.  The value is high too (relatively cheap).  Not a bad choice and MUCH better than the Imperial Dungeon."
3,"Good food for the price, and one of the better places that is available late night. This location is in need of serious cleaning. Which is the ONLY reason why I'm giving  3 stars and not 5. The best food and great service doesn't make up for filth when it is dead in the middle of the night / early morning and there are employees standing around."
3,"I've been here a half dozen times or so, mostly because it's pretty inexpensive.  If you're looking to fill up after a long day of pressing the slot machine \""spin\"" button, you should probably give it a shot.  The champagne brunch is worth the price, and the servers I've had have all been fast and generous with the mimosas.  \n\nThere's probably not a single item on the buffet that you'll \""need\"" to go back for, but as far as overall value for your dollar, it's hard to beat.  \n\nI'll go back.  More than once."
3,"This place was ok I'm my opinion. We had to wait an hour to be seated then had to wait about another hour for our food to come out. I ordered the waffles and it was a good size, not sure i would split it since i don't think it was as much, however my hubs ordered something different and his plate was huge  it could easily feed to adults. Overall i recommend eating there at least once."
3,"Not as glitzy as the other hotels on the strip but it's a cheap place to stay and who doesn't love waking up to flamingos just outside the window. The buffet is cheap! Not great but cheap. Everything about the flamingo is like a flamingo, not as glitzy as a peacock but not as dull as a chicken?\n\nLive, Laugh, and Lunch\nPatty"
3,"We were in Southern Highlands, looking for a place with Wi-Fi... \n\nWe found one, Perk Up.. Since I'm always excited to try something new, we rushed right in. \n\nAt first when I looked up at the menu all we saw were coffees & teas. They also had a display case that had muffins and sweet rolls, and slices of quiche. \n\nI finally looked to the right and there was a stand up menu chalk board that offered some breakfast & lunch options. \n\nI ordered some tea then decided I wanted lunch.. I asked about a couple of the sandwiches and the girl at the cash register was great in describing some of the offerings and even mentioned how she had pumpkin muffins coming out of the oven. YUM! \n\nI ordered the quiche, which came with a side of fruit. Once served the quiche was good, but I've had better, the small portion of fruit looked as though it had saved from last week, perhaps so since it was a Monday. My friend had mentioned that the fruit did not look appealing and most likely was a couple of days old. They immediately cut up some fresh fruit and brought it out to us. \n\nNice, clean place with great service. It's not a place I am craving to go back to for lunch, but to meet for coffee or tea, you betcha!"
3,"We came here for lunch and a view of the strip.  There's not much of a weekday lunch crowd and getting a nice table with a view of the strip, Bellagio, and Caesars' Palace was easy.  I had a nice $16 burger that was cooked medium rare as requested.  Wife had baked vegetable crepes for $17.  Food was ok, but you're really paying for the view.   They also served complimentary bread puffs and a nice pistachio pudding.   Having recently gone to the Hancock's 95th floor Signature Room, I thought we might be going to the top of the Eiffel Tower, but this place is like at the 5th floor elevation.  Makes sense - they wouldn't have a whole lot of tables at the top of that skinny tower!"
3,"An update in my last review, since the improvements have been made. Unfortunatley I wanted to improve my 3 stars...but alas I cant. Yes the improvements have been made and you can see the results, but its still so bleak. Why are train stations always so cold even although they have an indoor waiting area?? \nThis is a well used station, more effort needed !!!"
3,Located at one end of the Miracle Mile Shops.   Plenty of seating and lots of help behind the counter.   You can look out into the pool area during the day.
3,Basic burger and onion rings were good not great. Decent meal if you're at the Mirage but otherwise I'd look for another option if I was inclined to go elsewhere.
3,"The events center was nice, but nothing special from a trade show perspective. Perhaps I would have liked it better if I were there for a concert or boxing event.\n\nI tried to get wi-fi outside, but it was $500 per day!!! PER DAY! I want to say it was a typo or a bug in the system, but I was so turned off I didn't even try connecting. There's taking advantage of an audience, and then there's straight robbery. $500 for wi-fi is ridiculous. The Las Vegas Convention Center has free wi-fi.\n\nAlso, I tried to get a cab afterward, and there were none. I was about the 10th person in line, and I had to wait 20+ minutes for a cab. I'm not sure why that area's not well served by cabs. I would have been better off walking to the front of the hotel which is about 10 minutes from the event center.\n\nOverall, I'd say go for the event, not the event center itself."
3,"Went here because it's associated with Floyd Mayweather. Cute spot, kind of a tourist attraction, but a bit pricey. Not a plus size store by no stretch if the imagination. I'm really into customer service and perhaps I may have bought something if it were a bit more genuinely welcoming. I'd give them another try I'm totally down for small businesses and #girlpower"
3,"Ever want to see a hipster Applebee's?  I've only come by for lunch during the week, service is usually decent but time to get your food always seems to take a lot longer than it should.  \n\nThey've also rolled out the new table side computers, I hate how distracting they are and how pushy servers are about using them. Honestly I dropped a star just for that and it will probably cause me to stop coming by as often as I do.\n\nFood quality is what you expect, Sysco food with way too much sodium.  Saying that the chicken tortilla soup and honey pepper chicken tenders are pretty good.\n\nLast thing is music, not that loud but everything they play is on a sliding scale from meh to truly aggravating.  Wow, after writing this I wonder why we go so much."
3,This place is funny!\n\nThey literally have a sign on the wall that says you can only sit and eat for a max of 20 mins!  So I hope you are hungry!!!
3,"Lovely location overlooking the lake.  Flexible with last-minute reservations (and we were a party of 7).  Not ideal for small children.  Had to flag down the server multiple times (more water, ready to order, ready for the check)...The food wasn't bad, but overly priced.  The wine and dessert lists were both extensive.  But here's why I won't return: two antipasta plates were brought out by the server and as we did not order/ask for this, we assumed it was a complimentary offering.  When the bill arrived, we were charged $72 for the plates ($12 per adult), which we naturally disputed.  On top of the server not removing the antipasta from the bill, he refused to assist us by separating the bill into 4 checks (which in honesty wasn't something we asked for upfront, but hey, it happens).  With Lake Las Vegas' Village struggling the way it is, you'd think the businesses there would bend over backwards to bring their patrons back, especially the locals.  Long story short, I've got a bad taste in my mouth after this experience, and won't be recommending this restaurant any time soon."
3,"If you're a gringo, than this is the place for you. The drink specials here are killer, but the food is better at Taco Bell..."
3,"So I don't normally expect a lot when eating at IHOP, but this one isn't that bad! And it's actually quite a busy location. I made the mistake of going here to eat during spring training season - it was insanely packed and we waited quite a while to be seated. However, once we were at our table the service was good and so was the food. This IHOP is open 24 hours, which may be good to know in case I get a midnight pancake craving."
3,"You always walk out feeling healthy. The thinly sliced beef and veggies in broth or sauce is enough to be filling without making you feel like you just ate a truck because it is light on carbs. You get a small portion of noodles but most of the meal is protein and vegetable. Good deal for the money. The sukiyaki can sometimes be a bit too salty, especially when it boils down. I prefer the shabu shabu."
3,"I LOVE this place and if I had a million hours to waste I would walk my lazy self across campus and pick up some sweet and sour chicken and have a free Styrofoam cup of green tea every day of my life. Unfortunately they do not deliver and I don't even think they know how to use a phone. The last time I was there the man was so busy he picked up the phone and put them on hold and never picked it back up. I found it funny, but I'm sure that customer did not. \nAnd, you know, if they opt out of delivery they should really clean the place up a bit. I get worried what the kitchen looks like and have peeked back there a few times to see complete chaos (mostly because there's 8 or 9 women cooking for too many customers to handle). \nI love the food, but this place is great to go to maybe a few times per semester. It's just too crowded for my liking."
3,"Hype precedes realty here at Chocolat Bistro. Unfortunately the Las Vegas tourist TV plug doesn't help matters... It is a good crepe by non enthusiast standards, however this is Vegas,  so giddy up and REALLY indulge at a 4 star buffet!"
3,"Poutine was high on our list of things to try in Montreal. Cafe Poutine was a clear stop given it's name and location in touristy, Old Montreal location. The restaurant was small and crowded...it was tough  trying to get between the tables. \n\nThe menu was promising - tons of Poutine options as well as sandwiches with a side of poutine as an option. My fiance had the poutine with smoked meat and I had the chicken, apple and brie sandwich- no poutine (I figured I could share). The portions were huge - I had a pile of fries on my plate (even though I had asked for no fries). The poutine was okay, not as mind-blowing as fries with cheese and gravy promised to be. My sandwich was so delicious. The baguette was perfectly toasted and the brie and apples were a great compliment.\n\nThe service was hurried and not very accommodating. i asked for no cheese on the sandwich, which they said wasn't possible. They also missed the no fries request.\n\nThe prices were also high- 2 waters, smoked meat poutine and a chicken sandwich set us back 35 CA. It makes sense for the district, but not for the overall experience.\n\nBottom line - if you're in the area and don't want to dig for poutine, this would be an ok stop. If you're looking for and awesome poutine experience, keep on walking."
3,A necessary evil in the realm of electronics. Service is so spotty - a few nice salesclerks but a lot who are either incompetent or pushy. Always good to know just what you want when you go in.
3,"Oversold flight... How exactly that happens? \n\nWas flying back home from an Iron Maiden concert in Phoenix and found, to my surprise, that although I'd paid for my reservation and checked in early, my flight was oversold. I was pissed to say the least. This review started @ 1 star. I raised it to 3 because the staff actually found me a very comfortable seat on the same flight... and I was able to get out quickly. The flight attendants were really nice and courteous.\n\nSo? I was happy."
3,"This theater plays all the recent and popular flicks. The prices are pretty much right up there with the other chains like Regal and AMC. However this theater could use some updating. The bathrooms are horrific; they smell terrible and are always trashed. I suggest going to the very back of the theater to use those reatrooms. The seats in the theater are sticky and have weird stains on them, and many of the arm rests are falling apart.  The best part about this theater is it shows indi films sometimes...so that's cool."
3,"It's Cracker Barrel. I haven't eaten there for years, at least 8 or more.\nWe ordered take out last week.\nHusband said to give excellent feedback based on the manager fixing a problem with our order.\n4 stars for  the manager\n-1star for the chicken fried steak"
3,"This was my first restaurant in Phoenix. I was taken here for a lunch prior to an interview I had. I was pretty nervous about the whole situation so I don't remember too many details, but I would recommend this place if you're a sushi lover or on the go and need a quick lunch to eat at your desk. Service was great too."
3,I don't eat fish but my family does. My husband & daughter said the fried catfish is awesome! I got a steak which sucked. Everything on the menu is fried & there isn't one healthy thing offered. It's basically a heart attack in the making. Even the salad came loaded with cheese & bacon. If your even the least concerned about your health you will leave feeling guilty.
3,"what i haven't reviewed this place yet and iv been here 100 times ...no serious at least, it is the best eatery in the east valley but my friends at Corbin's could really help spice up there menu. the food is good here but once you get use to the menu it gets old quick. there pasta dishes are over sauced or buttered chicken wings are some of the better ones iv had pizzas are good ect all the times i have been there and the owner has seen me he has never said hi,thanks for coming,good to see you AGAIN.........get out......... oh this place is usually packed between 5ish and 8ish again because its one of the few and far between better places in the east valley....they do have a great beer slection"
3,"I'm not going to deny one bit, the food was pretty good. I got the barbacoa burrito and the meat was really tender and sweet. Nothing was too dry, but that could also be the result of the wet beans and sauce they put in the burrito. The problem with that is that you cannot pick up the burrito and eat it with your hands, you're going to need a knife and fork. That was one downside of the food and it's not one of the cheaper places either. \n\nThe food is quite pricy for the amount that is given. Chipotle is slightly cheaper and quite similar. That being the first time i went to Cafe Rio, they knew i was a beginner and asked tricky questions. When you order, they ask after they form your burrito if you want it enchilada style. I said no as well as my friend behind me and they did it with his and they charge you .95 cents more for it! Is it really worth it? i highly doubt it especially since it's just sauce and cheese. They don't even tell you these things cost more money, they just ask you and make you fall into their trap. Tricky people.\n\nBottom line, food is good, kind of pricy, and the people are tricky. Not an everyday kind of place if you don't have the money to spend and it's not so bad if you know the menu and style of the place and how you order food."
3,"We went earlier in the week because my aunt just totally loves the fried soft shell crab appetizer there.  I think I will have to beg to differ on this point.  Don't get me wrong.  It wasn't bad, but I think I've had way better at other comparable Japanese restaurants.  In addition to the average fried soft shell crab, we ordered two different boats, which was wayyyyy too much food for four people, filled with various sushi rolls of spicy tuna, california, eel, soft shell crab, skewers of chicken teriyaki, sashimi. \n\nConclusion:  Average food.  Definitely not my first choice to go to for Japanese food."
3,"If there was a button that said \""not for vegetarians\"", I'd click it.\n\nThat aside, my carnivorous friends really like the comfort food this place serves up, and the bar staff is quick and friendly for their happy hour.  A large chunk of the crowd in the afternoon and early evening are lawyers, as this is where they head after work in the nearby buildings."
3,"This is a secret lifesaving gem in Planet Hollywood. Reasonable priced food, sort of fast depending on when you go, in the middle of the Strip.\n\nNot the best sandwich ever. Not even very good. But it does the trick.\n\nAnd it is 24 hours, which comes in handy after a late night in Sin City."
3,"Three Stars because the staff was incredibly nice - and - rooms are a nice size.  \n\nExperience:  2.5 stars\n\nRoom was not available until after check in time.  Had time to drop off bags and head out.  Hit the strip, had dinner, came back to resort and hung out in my friends' suite. Arrived in my room 12 hours later ...  4:15am.  Bed linens are dirty.  Staff came and replaced everything with sheets pillows comforter just recd from cleaning company.  \nOther minor things occurred but staff was \nalways pleasant; not sure if I would stay there again."
3,"The ambiance/decor is really great. It's fun and hip. You can sit on the balcony or step out to the balcony during the Treasure Island pirate ship show and have a great view.\n\nBAD: prices are high.\n\nBAD: stir-fry shrimp with sambal sauce. Way too salty, had to send it back.\n\nBAD: kobe beef sliders were way too salty. came with an untraditional ketchup, mustard, and good onion rings.\n\nOK with major potential: Lychee beignets. These arrive in traditional round beignet form but are filled with a substance that tastes like batter with chopped lychees. I guess the chef doesn't know that beignet are supposed to be light and airy. These are more like doughnuts and are too sweet because they're covered in sugar crystals. I loved the lychee taste when I could taste it.\n\nOK: the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno preparation was tasty but the slices were really thin and the fish could have been fresher.\n\nGOOD: edamame. served warm with some salt.\n\nGOOD: sushi. Hubby is very picky and he enjoyed his nigiri and hand-rolls.\n\nGOOD: hubby really liked the steak yakitori in the sauce that has a long name starting with a K."
3,"I visited on 10/26/11 for lunch. The girl working at the counter seemed almost annoyed we came at an off-peak hour. I asked if they served coffee and she there's two coffee shops next door. A little sarcastic, not very friendly. Had I not already paid I would have just gone next door for coffee AND lunch. The bread for the caprese sandwich was good,  warm and slightly toasted. I understand that caprese salad is generally served chilled but on a sandwich, it tasted off. Like warm and flakey on the outside, cold on the inside. Decent but not enough to entice me back anytime soon."
3,"Second time visiting this burger joint, I do have to say I really like this place the burgers rock! They are real juicy burgers. You will definately walk out of there full and happy. They have burritos and bowls too,but I just can't get past the burgers. Its always clean and the workers are always nice and helpful. They never look to busy though, hope they stick around."
3,"I used to order almost weekly. I like their pizza but their ravioli is always overcooked. I like it Al dente. Their lasagne is ok. I always have to ask them not to overcook the bread knots because mine were burnt several times.  They were late with my order at least three times even though I live 5 min away. This was after the lunch hour and before dinner hour, not what I would consider to be a busy time. I probably won't be back."
3,"GF cakes and scones :-) Or so I thought. I had heard great things about Mimi's so I was keen to go and with a fellow GF amigo, we headed down to the Shore. We had told Mimi's we would be in so we knew there would be some GF products available.\n\nIf you are coming for GF cake, then there are better options. We had great tasting scones, however, they crumbled into little bits and we ate them with jam and cream with a spoon. Our cupcake was just a normal iced fairy cake, so no lavish creations like those at Cuckoo's. \n\nI know fellow Yelpers speak highly of Mimi's and the cakes do look amazing, but for us GF gals, it was really disappointing and there are better cakes to be had around town, without shlepping to The Shore like we did..."
3,"This is not the most authentic Ethiopian food, but it is one of the better ones in AZ. The food was full of flavor and spice. The sour injera (spongy bread) with alicha sega wat (beef stew) is delicius. I also enjoy getting the combos which includes three different stews. It's a great way to find out what you like."
3,"The server was excellent. Never left the drinks empty and everything came out in a timely manner. I ordered the chili cheese fries and 12 wings honey BBQ style. The sauce was a little over powering and the wings didn't stay warm long. They were cold within five minutes. Same deal for the fries. \n\nAlso, because I used to bartend I am picky about how drinks are made and my Shirley temple was made with the grenadine on the bottom. This made it difficult to mix and a little too sweet. \n\nWe sat outside which was really nice and the TVs were ideal for watching the Carolina v Duke game. I'm guess food is one of their last priorities, but id still come back to watch the games."
3,"I really wanted to like Tao. It was my first clubbing experience in Vegas.\n\nI love the decor and theme.  The buddha, the girls in the bathtubs, the restroom doors you have to lock to make opaque are all fun.  \n\nUnfortunately it gets wayyyy too crowded and the crowd was just ok.  We won't be back.  Head over to the clubs at Encore/the Wynn instead."
3,"There's good and bad here.  \n\nGood = Happy hour is pretty solid.  There's always a good crowd.  The atompshere is as good as it gets for Chandler.  Staff is pretty nice.\n\nBad = The tables are packed in tight.  Tight like a fat kid's waistband after a no-holds barred Golden Corral session.  Parking is bad.  You'll probably have to park by the other businesses in the complex and huff it over.  The food is mediocre at best.  \n\nAll in all if you're looking for a happy hour spot to start the night, you could do worse.  If you're looking for a meal, head elsewhere."
3,"this is a pretty cool little, unasuming pit stop if you're in downtown phoenix...\nthe gallery also houses a bookstore and bakery/restaurant.\nthe gallery is HUGE, with brick walls and concrete floor, it's a cool little historic building that stays true to its origins.\nthe art tends to be of the ridiculously overpriced, nothing special variety, but, like i said, it's a nice little meal/book browse/gallery pit stop if you're in the are and have time."
3,"Not all barbecue is created equally. I'm from Chicago and grew up eating barbecue NOT pulled porked sandwiches or beef brisket, but pork barbecue ribs & rib tips from the south side of Chicago. Ya know, the kind where white bread and french fries are saturated in sauce at the bottom of the basket. Where you have to work a little bit to pull the meat off the bone. Where you smell the charred ribs a few blocks away. Now that's barbecue to me.\n\nThis does not mean that I cannot appreciate other types of barbecue. We spilt the pulled pork sandwich and slab of ribs. It was good, but I packed the leftovers for my husband's lunch today. When something is really good I don't share and sadly, the ribs we just okay. \n\nI gave an extra star for the customer service. The hostess and waitress were polite, attentive and nice. Too bad more establishments are not as well run as Bobby Q."
3,"Gotta love Groupon....Sometimes. This time, the buzz wasn't ready for the flood of people. They were too slammed for their own good. Service WAY SLOW. Wrong stuff delivered, but we were too hungry to care!! Our neighborhood sushi joint couldn't handle the pressure, but, we will still be back..."
3,"Went to a Rutland Bar with friends for some drinks one evening.\n\nPrices here are a bit high for me but it has great atmosphere and nice staff. A very classy place!\n\nIf you're thinking of chatting while in a classy place with a street level view of princes street, it's not a bad place to go for some drinks and just chill out."
3,"Rudy's is a pretty decent place to get a BBQ Sandwich.  \n\nPros:  -There is sauce a-plenty and they are all pretty tasty\n            -Creamed Corn is OUT OF THIS WORLD \n            -Big space with plenty of seating\n            -Location is easy to find and near lots of shopping\n\nCons: -Service is a bit unprofessional flirting and weird comments abundant\n           -There are no french fries (BBQ without fries is kind of un-American)\n            -\""General Store\"" is pretty lame.  Nothing like a Cracker Barrel.  \n           \nI say try it.  If for no other reason than that freaking amazing creamed corn!  I know this sounds weird.  As a rule I am not even a big fan of creamed corn, but WOW!  This stuff is GOOD."
3,"Went here for an \""employee meeting\"" today and was pleasantly surprised. The host and waitress were really nice, and we had some good service. Ended up ordering a Bleu & Black burger and it was good - fries were okay, a little soggy from the huge ass pickle with all its pickle juice but I didn't mind all too much... probably because I was so hungry. \n\nI won't go out of my way to come back to BW3, but I also wouldn't object either. So this place gets an okay from me. If anything, I can always update my review!"
3,"Honestly, the food was probably 2-star quality, but I'm giving it 3 because it was late, and we were hungry, and it was open. That said, it was very generic quality breakfast/diner food, and while it satisfied my hunger, it didn't quite hit the spot."
3,The ultimate skillet was more like vegetable skillet. Barely any sausage. Pancake is good. Food is decent too. Overall just an average.
3,I came here around 4 times and the food is amazing\nI tried many italian food and I am really picky about taste but  this is best among vegas italian restautants.  One thing that i did not like is Service from server.  I hope server check customer more often and give nice smile at least
3,not a bad place for a pint before a game.... but it can get packed!!!  i also found out that they don't have a food menu... you get your food from a different part of the bar and bring it back to your seat.... \n\nthe large outside area is awesome because it is so big...
3,"I applaud the look of this place and the artistry of the setup at the sushi bar. My primary goal was to relax for half an hour or so between professional obligations and grab an appetizer and a beer, and Fujo definitely accommodated those needs in a timely fashion.\n\nBeing in the Carolinas and craving something with a bit of heat, I opted for the Cajun Roll which featured crayfish with shrimp and crab. It was nothing mind-blowing, but neither was it repulsive. Since moving the South I've learned that one was must accept, I've learned to be thankful for what I can get in the sushi department. However, I was really not a particularly big fan of the hot-and-sour soup. The ingredients were not particularly fresh, and the un-nuanced broth was just on the verge of being genuinely unpleasant  to get down.\n\nThis place still has a certain charm to it, but it's probably not Charlotte's best work from a culinary standpoint."
3,"Food was ok. Never expect amazing food from any of the India Palaces and Taj Mahals. There was a private party going on and the kids were running around, yelling and misbehaving. The restaurant should have closed admission to general public or have asked the private party for courtesy.\n\nService was good, food was mediocre. We went because this was the closest place and everything else had waiting. Rightfully so."
3,"Went to Fuel to grab lunch.I had two slices of The Extreme Fuel Pizza which is pepperoni,Italian sausage,meatballs,ham and ground beef for the uninitiated as well as the Garlic Knots.There have been several restaurants in this particular spot over the years but I believe this one is gonna stick around on a while.The pizza was great and the service even better.Call and order ahead if you can because this place gets crowded really fast.This is a definite step up from your local corporate pizza fare.Enjoy."
3,"Not as good as the sign says, but for the price its not so bad. Old dinner feel in glendale. If u have the time, check it out once."
3,"I cannot speak to the food here, but drinking beer in a church seems so wrong and so right at the same time.\n\nWe sampled 3 or 4 of the beers brewed in house and they were all wonderful. One of the Belgian Style Ales (I forget the name) was absolutely delicious.\n\nAlong the same lines as many other reviews the service left a bit to be desired. Oh Church Brew Works I wanted to give you 4 stars but servers that get salty because we aren't ordering food? Minus 1 star. I mean c'mon the name of the place has Brew in the name. Maybe we should've stayed sitting at the bar...\n\nRegardless, an awesome place to check out simply for drinking beer in what used to be a church!"
3,"This used to be the closest pub to my old flat, so we would often pop over for some afternoon relief. Its your standard pub, nothing out of the ordinary here folks. The prices are quite good, at one stage they did a 99p glass of wine. Although with ever changing licensing laws, that probably doesn't happen anymore. I used to get a Kopperburg for \u00a32.85 which was pretty reasonable for Edinburgh.\n\nThis pub is located just along from Edinburgh bus station, so its a good stop off if you have time to kill before you hop on a bus. Just a relaxed pub which is good for a quick after work drink or a catch up with a friend."
3,"We decided to try a new spot for sushi this last weekend and the rain made it undesirable to travel far from home. We pulled into this small location not knowing what to expect and was happy with our experience.\n\nWe ordered 4 sushi rolls and some Goyza / edamame as appetizers which tasted perfect. The diamondback roll was the best of the three and would be a definite the next time we stop in, absolute lightly fried goodness! the fried cali roll was great and the dragon as well. My wife liked the spicy shrimp roll as well, but that isn't my type of roll. \n\nWe would love to come during happy hour to save some cash and my only real con's about the place would be the decor and space. Other than that the Sushi is great and there is plenty of room for a nice quiet date night for two, but not a huge party setting for sure.\n\nSushi Rocks overall here though!"
3,"It is what it is!  It is still cheaper to mail stuff here than it is with UPS and FedEx, so they are doing something right! \n\nThis post office is ok.  It is big and has a lot of room to wait in line, which you will be doing, which makes the wait in line a little better.  It makes it less claustrophobic like many of the older locations around town where you feel like you are in a cattle car.   There is always a line here though, no matter what time of day you come., so always give yourself some extra time when you stop by.  They never have all of the windows open for some reason, which slows everything down.  They also recently removed the stamp machine, so now everyone needing stamps have to wait in line as well, which also adds to the line length.  \n\nThere is a self service machine for mailing smaller, regular packages, which is really quite nice.  You can get in and out quickly if you don't need to talk to a desk agent.  This is a huge plus for me, since I rarely need a desk agent.  I am a DIY kinda girl, so I just love it!\n\nAnother plus is the huge parking lot.  The post office by my mom has about 15 spots, so having 100 or so is nice, especially if you are mailing a lot of items.\n\nOverall, it is a decent location."
3,"Not the classiest  or fancy-est hotel, but it's good enough. I stay here alot, and always have a great time. I LOVE the Toby Keith bar here- so much fun! There is also a good chinese restaurant.  The casino itself is a good size and the staff is average- never had a problem or complaint. The location is also pretty good.\nHarrah's has great deals and promotions on rooms so make sure you join the club."
3,"My sister and I went out in China town on a Friday night craving sushi. Not wanting to wait 90 minutes for a spot, I asked her if she had ever had Korean BBQ, she said \""Yes!\"" and this is where we ended up.\n\nThe reason I ask is because I am not one to opt for foreign cuisine when I don't know what to expect and I want someone to tell me what to do. Once I've been gone, I can fly solo and introduce friends to something new and exciting.\n\nWe walked in and there were little booths set up in rows, all with big, circular grills as centerpieces to the tables. It was BBQ-ing indoors. There were several types of beef (tongue, rib, etc.), there were fresh shrimp, and a few pork options. It really is carnivore paradise.\n\nThere were few veggie options in the form of a salad bar, there was some other prepared Asian food, sweet and sour pork, sushi, tempura veggies, and various other salads (along the lines of macaroni, but Asian, not sure what they are called).\n\nMy drink glass was never empty and they made sure to clean out our grill when it got too messy.\n\nThis was definitely different and I love it! A must try!"
3,"We just sort of ended up here.   This one is full of the old folks with coupons and oxygen tanks from Sun City. Dinner here starts at 3:00PM.  We usually sit at the bar and just enjoy some appetizers and drinks.  They have some decent mixed drinks and some tasty apps.  The bartenders are great and appreciate when young'uns like us show up.    There's always better seafood out there, but in a pinch Red Lobster is solid and will suffice."
3,"Not one of my favorites...too much shabby chic and country store new stuff...real antiques are hit and miss, and prices vary wildly.  More often than not staff seems  aloof - either that, or I feel like me and my kids are being followed.  Sometimes you'll find a bargain, and some of the new dealers have created some space with real ambiance, so I will keep trying!"
3,"I had a Papa Kelsey's Special Pizza while my wife had a Calzones with extra toppings  like tomato, green bell pepper, olives and onion. We both ordered two Italian salad with blue cheese and ranch dressing. Can't believe I had so much root beer.\nOver all the food was alright. We had a good lunch. One of their booth seats, the upholstery is torn. Not a good thing. But, Folks like what I said we have to continually support our local restaurants."
3,"Go here for the strong margarita's to escape the heat of the strip. .\n\nThe margaritas we had were great.  Try them on the rocks or frozen--doesn't really matter.  I was pretty surprised to be honest, as they just make huge batches of the stuff and pump it out en masse. \n\nThe food wasn't anything spectacular, but you most certainly could do worse on the strip for your money.  You are really paying for the atmosphere here.  Everything is tacky and very Vegas, but that's why you are there in the first place.\n\nDefinitely would go again, just nothing incredible or mind-blowing in my book."
3,"I actually visited the original location in DC Ranch. I stopped here with some friends for a late night snack and drinks. This was my first time here so one of the guys ordered a couple of Tootsie Rolls for the 4 of us (well 3 of us since my boyfriend doesn't like sushi) and a Berry White martini (It's blue) and it was fantastic. Don't remember what was in the Toostie Roll, sorry, but I love sushi so I usually just inhale it, but it was good too. There's a cool sleek vibe to this place."
3,"Love the setup, love that they have pool tables, love the big screens, great music, great atmosphere, great servers, good food.  Ultimate Grilled Cheese is indeed ultimate...it's a stand out dish that put a smile on my foodie friend's face; not a fan of the veggie burger tho.  But overall, I can dig it..."
3,This Target location is like any other Target location.  I literally cannot think of anything that stands out about this place except that it has hybrid car charging stations in their parking lot.
3,This location is quite busy. Had a good deal on Big Mac's. Quick and easy food to pick up for the kids on the go ...
3,"I have been to three locations of this establishment and have been prettty pleased with my visits. I always opt for  breakfast here... The Acapulco express omelette is excellent..chorizo, avocado, green chilies and onions, melted cheeses, sour cream and their fresh made salsa.  I also love their french toast, which along with pancakes and waffles are made from scratch. The Floridian french toast used to be Arizona french toast and had the most delectible prickly pear butter with it, but it's newer incarnation is covered in berries and kiwi and is tasty nonetheless. I have never had bad service here. I've mostly received 25% tip worthy attentiveness.  I like how there seems to be delightful little bowls of fruit on the side with most entrees. (And not just crappy melons and grapes) Also, the coffee isn't bad and they have the courtesy to leave a fresh caraffe full so I am never caffeine deprived when leaving. All in all its a solid joint for breakfast in my humble opinion."
3,"I was so disappointed. I'm still disappointed. This place was supposed to be the best Italian food ever and quite frankly it wasn't. I like the layout of the place, its beautiful and the people that work here are awesome, but my expectations were so high for the food to be so low. I would come back though. I dont know when since there are so many other restaurants to try in LV, but if this was one of the only places open on a certain day then yes count me in. I don't even remember what I ordered. THAT is a bad sign. Their bread was tasty though."
3,"Good pub with a great selection of beer. Food was pretty damn good but our waitress was a little slow to start but on Point after we got our beers. I definitely will come again but maybe not for dinner. Over all, I was happy with my visit."
3,"Wasn't the best buffet. The shimp tasted like rubber, the Chinese food was overly salty, the sushi was tasteless . The crab legs were really small. Nothing like the king crab that were in the other pictures. Only thing good was the deserts, prime rib and open bar. Very pricey $30."
3,"Okay overall - nasty burnt garlic in sag paneer (big points off) but naan was good.  Mango lassi was great.  \n\nThe sign on the door about beer & wine was confusing - I thought it meant they had only beer & wine and no cocktails.  But it actually means there is no alcohol - you can bring your own, but only beer and wine.  \n\nThe decor is very nice."
3,"We were just in Vegas and saw 4 shows: Mystere, Le Reve, O and Criss Angel-Believe. While theatrically beautiful and some amazing moments, it's definitely not all that it's hyped up to be. Way too expensive to make it worth it and a lot of boring moments. Mystere was by far the best! Maybe not the most theatrically intricate etc, but definitely the most entertaining."
3,Went to shoku ramn about 3 weeks ago. I ordered the tonkotsu ramen and the potstickers. the potstickers were good they were slightly burnt thats usually how i like it. its a lot crunchier when you bite into them. the ramen...now the ramen needs work the broth was extremely salty and the noodles were way too overcooked. basically when you bit into the noodles it was mushy. i definitely did not like that. i felt like the broth was so overly seasoned i couldnt taste anything but salt. i wouldnt go back to shoku unless i was really hungry and i was extremely close to it. i wouldnt drive out my way to go eat there again.
3,"For a pharmacy on the Strip, the service was terribly slow and all checkers had long lines.  This is on the boring side on the street; there is a Walgreens on the other side.  Once again, no one offered me or asked me about a their ExtraCare discount card."
3,A bit pricey. Portions are rather small but the food is good. The decor is beautiful. The ahi tuna is my favorite. Unfortunately I never had the opportunity to have a cocktail here. :-(
3,"A very nice spa pedicure that made my day!  Heck, my week!  They are clean and friendly but need new massage chairs.  Will definitely go back again and again, new chairs or not!"
3,"I gotta say, I do not see where the rave reviews for ATS come from. I get the niche vegan group but, aside from the chain being named best carne asada by a local paper, I find the restaurant underwhelming. Don't get me wrong, it isn't bad -- the place is clean, has its own style, and has found success with shops all around town now. But I find the menu limited, the prices high, and the food just okay.\n\nBut when out of towners visit looking for the Best Mexican food, I steer elsewhere."
3,"Came here to meet a friend for happy hour today.  I arrived 20 minutes early so thought I'd grab a drink and play Draw Something on my phone while I wait at a table by the bar.  I normally experience prompt service here, but it took someone 15 minutes to say, \""Hi, can I get you something?\""  It was a bit strange to wait so long for someone to come by.  \n\nAfter that the service was good.  I had their happy hour wine Cabernet and my friend had a Sam Adams.  She got the blackened fish tacos and I got the chicken and shrimp lettuce cups.  They were very good, but greasy.  I wasn't sure what was causing the grease, but it made my lettuce cups rip easily.  I normally like the food here, so it wasn't the biggest deal.  They were very tasty, just hard to eat.  I would come here again and get the flat bread and sushi!"
3,I am not the biggest fan of fast food ever. But I really like Five Guys and this location is superb! \n\nThey have really yummy fries and they give you so many! Like your bag overflows with the greasy buggers. Say what? Yeah they are really greasy. But good!\n\nThe burgers are really quite the bang for your buck too! Not the best burgers in the world but it is fast food not gourmet burgers. Be considerate for what you are eating and enjoy it for what it is. \n\nThe pop machines are radical. You can pretty much have flavoured any beverage you like. \n\nThe staff here is really friendly and that is a plus anywhere you go!
3,"I love the food at Noodles. Always delicious, portions are faily large, selection is great. The service leaves a bit to be desired. The last time I was in, there were approximately three occupied tables in the dining room. Every single other table, aside from one small 2 seat table had dishes and food left on them waiting to bussed. We had to ask to have a table cleared for us before we could sit down. Maybe if the restaurant had been busy at the time, it would be a bit more understandable, but the place was dead."
3,"I came here around 8:40pm on a monday night and there were around 3 parties already there. I went to the bathroom before sitting down and, low and behold, there was a humungous cockroach staring back at me while I was peeing! Ew\n\nMy friend and I both got the AYCE dinner for $22.95 and the appetizer labeled \""THE SHIT! must try,\"" which was more shitty than the shit in my opinion. My friend really liked it though. We also got the 2-for-1 sapporo deal, which was pretty awesome because we got 2 huge bottles that was enough to fill 4 cups. \n\nThe sashimi salad was hooked up with sashimi, which is good because I don't like eating a bunch of rice at AYCE places, as it gets me unnecessarily full. I also ordered salmon, yellowtail, and albacore sashimi, which all tasted pretty fresh, but definitely not the best fish. Really thin slices too. The sashimi roll was good too, stuffed with assorted raw fish and rapped in cucumber (no rice). My friend ordered a spicy crab roll (basically a california roll but with spicy crab), monster roll, baked lobster roll, and baked scallop roll, which were all pretty good. \n\nThis place kinda smelled like clorox, but it wasn't anything too overbearing."
3,I'm giving this place a 3 stars because of the food which is really good like the bb wings are really spicy but tastes good. The flavored soju is really well made too and we tried almost all the flavors. Now for the rest of my review of this place. The environment is nice but the service is not that great. I have done karaoke before with friends didn't have a problem. I go there again to karaoke and while I'm in the room singing the guy owner comes into my room with a group of people and starts doing a tour and actually had the nerve to ask if it was okay for him to do so....... I thought that was the rudest thing ever especially if the room is occupied. Ever since that one time I never went back just because of the crappy service and rudeness I got from the male owner of the place.
3,"I seriously can't bitch too much about this place....it was Comp'd for being a Platinum Player. Of course this hotel is older and not as \""hip and trendy\"" but for the little time it's used I honestly didn't mind it.\nIt was a little creepy though with house keeping...we had out \""don't disturb\"" door hanged outside the door and it was around 3pm we were trying to quick-nap and she didn't even knock and just tried making her way in...I was like \""No No Please leave\"" I was so hungover I couldn't really bitch but yeah total creeper haha\n\nAlso if you happen to stay on the strip side with a view HEADS UP!!! \n\nThey have this shitty band that plays from 11am until 2am it's HORRIBLE and on the last day when I wanted to SLEEP I couldn't I seriously almost went to the local grocery store just to buy a few dozens of eggs and throw it at them (I know classy right) \nAnyhow overall not a super bad experience be cautious on their Chapel hours as well my buddy tried to marry some random and the chapel on the 3rd floor was already closed (not sure who lucked out on this one) but anyway Enjoy your stay :D"
3,"I like the idea of interacting the least amount possible when ordering food and this place has it down to a science. You walk in, look at the menu, choose the bag that corresponds with your sandwich, pick your toppings and hand it to the cashier. Done. They make your sandwich and you're on your way. I had the turkey with cole slaw and thousand island dressing. It was ok. The bread wasn't my favorite. It was crusty and didn't feel fresh. The turkey was very salty. Not sure if I'll try them again on my own but would be willing to try another sandwich if someone wanted to take me there:)"
3,"Fatty, tasty food.  I wish the salad did not have a huge tortilla to make it filling.\n\nThe drink station never seems well stocked at lunch.\n\nThe staff does a good job moving people through line at lunch, but I always have a difficult time waiting 20 minutes to order this food."
3,"Hof Kelsten is the latest addition to Mile End's boulangerie scene, and it instantly became recognized as a city-wide contender.  Baker/owner Jeffrey Finkelstein built up a reputation supplying many of Montreal's top restaurants with their bread before opening up to the public.  The approach leans towards Central Europe (caraway rye, rugelach, babka, etc.), but Hof Kelsten bakes some French loaves too (including my favourite Montreal baguette at the moment).  \n\nThey also serve meals (lunch, brunch), but so far I've stuck to the baked goods.  The pastries are generally good, and they're definitely refreshingly different from the kind of fare one tends to find in Montreal's bakery scene, but I've encountered problems with undercooked items from time to time, so now I just focus on their bread."
3,"So many great reviews I had to try.  First try I didn't check and went on a monday and they were closed boo....\n\nI had their regular burger with bacon, eggs, lettuce, tomato, ketchup, mayo....and....drum roll....the Bacon was really tasty.  That was the only thing that really stood out.  The presentation was good too...But the burger itself was pretty bland.  Maybe ive been spoiled with so many gourmet burger joints in california and vegas....but the bachi version was ok.   I didnt try any of their other specialty version as im not too fond of some of the items.\n\nThe seating arrangement was nice, i liked the decor, and service was good as well.  Looked liked they may be able to some outdoor seating?  shrugs...perhaps it is too hot in vegas....\n\nI would come again if i was hosting an out of towner who wanted an away from the strip experience...\n\nwe ordered 2 versions of the fries...and both were just a ok.  the truffle fries and some other ones with cilantro in it.  \n\nI think they tried to get a bit too creative ... at least for my taste."
3,"You get what you get for this price. The check out time was 11:00am and I called at 11 and asked for late check out at 1pm since we arrived late at the hotel and we're all tired. I've never had a problem w late check out since I'm not asking for like 5 hours extra. The lady said no 1pm, only till noon. And this pissed me off lol. Out of 100 other hotels I've stayed at(not exaggerating) I've never got turned down for this kind of little request. Especially in Vegas you don't want to get an experience like that. The room itself is decent and modern but not the service."
3,"An unpretentious, good ole' fashion bar that provides drinks, pool tables, and a place to just socialize with your friends. The only thing missing is a mechanical bull and chicken wings. They blast gay club mixes all night. And it attracts a diverse crowd of chubby lonely gays, twinks, bears, old-timers, and fag hags. Just to refute the idea it's a bear bar. (If you don't know what bear, twink, fag hag is, I'm not telling you. Urbandictionary.com) So it's all inclusive, y''all. They have drink specials on the daily and is a good pre-drink if you're going to the club across the street. However, smoking is permitted and you leave smelling like an ashtray. It does have that old Vegas vintage feel, I guess. But with the lack of options for Las Vegas gays to visit, I can't really complain too much."
3,"I have worked at planet Hollywood for years but have never been up here. Someone suggested that they had a pretty good variety of meats so we decided to give it a try since there was a groupon. So for 79$ you get all you can eat surf and turf( meat and seafood) the consisted everything from sirloin to lamb. Then the surf part which consist of mussels, shrimp salmon and tilapia? Comes on a separate plate. I can't rave too much on the food because some of the meats were quite dry but I did like the shrimp and sirloin. The salad bar was decent  with a variety of vegetables and hot dishes. \n\nSo an alcoholic beverage is included in the deal, I got a chinahuia (sp?) with pineapple, lime and tequila. Not too bad; definitely my  kinda drink. The hunny had a rum runner and it was poured much heavier than my drink. \n\nSo overall, it's an okay restaurant but for the same price I would go to texas de brasil. They have much better meat. Marcile was our server tonight and he was running around because his section was split, which I understand because I've worked in restaurants.  I was hesitant coming here because of all the bad reviews that I saw. But it wasn't as bad as anticipated."
3,"Every time I've gone here, usually week nights, there's always an initial and pungent smell of vomit possibly from last nights lets-go-have-dinner-turn-crazy-night-on-the-town vibe I get from this place.\n\nOnce I overcame the smell and was seated from the strangely under-dressed hostess, our waiter came to get our order in an even stranger bandana jean look that was very curious.\n\nWe started with the pretzel Gouda fondue appetizer.  Very gooey and delicious as expected, maybe too much salt, but gooey and delicious.  He had the salmon and I tried the French Dip.  The salmon was delicious and none was left on the plate.  I'm a sucker for French Dips, the one's that melt in your mouth and have a great au jus.  I was sadly disappointed here.  To start, a strange mayo based dressing is applied liberally giving the, what I would assume is the most tender and juicy, roast beef a strange creamy taste and texture that is not pleasant.  The au jus is a strong french onion soup that does not go well with the sandwich. \n\nOverall I felt the place tries too hard to be different, too hard to be the cool place in town.  The food was a 4 (the salmon was truly excellent), the environment was a 2...I split the difference."
3,"I can't decide if I like this place or not. They have really good happy hour and brunch specials on drinks, but I'm still undecided on the food. I've been here three or four times, and I've tried a variety of their foods...I just don't know. I can't really point out anything that was wrong with it. The first three or four bites are always delicious...but then it just gets boring. It's just the same flavors repeated over and over again. \n\nI've never experienced good service while I was there either. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't good. Today, I had to ask the waiter to bring me another iced tea after I had been sipping on empty for a few minutes. He got side tracked once he started waiting on some cute gay guys who came in and never did bring me another drink. \n\nOn the flip side, we went there for happy hour once and they accidentally charged my friend only $0.03 for 2 drinks. When we pointed it out, they said it was their fault so not to worry about it. \n\nAll in all...it's just okay. It will never be my choice as a restaurant, but if someone else wants to go I wouldn't be upset."
3,"After reading the reviews (and being from the East Coast), we needed to try In-N-Out Burger on our recent trip to Vegas.\n\nI will give it to you guys - it's a good burger, but people seem to go insane for these things!! LOL. Fries are good too. An average fast food chain. Quick and dirty - more emphasis on the 'dirty'.\n\nA note to the guy at the Drive-Thru Window: when you ask someone if they want ketchup, and, they reply 'no thank-you' - DO NOT stare at them blankly for 10 seconds like they're from another planet.  I guess you really like ketchup - don't you buddy - LMAO!!\n\nIf you've never tried, go for it, but, don't go too far out of your way. A hamburger is a hamburger......"
3,i found this place on yelp just went there for dinner ordered chow mein and thai tea.thai tea is absolutely great.this is the best thai tea I had.but disappointed on chow mein... its different type of chow mein than other thai restaurant.its just a Little thin than lo mein.(the fat noodle)\nfood was good EXCept too saltY.  service was alright.will come back try pad thai sometime and definitely will get thai tea too go A lot since im just 5min away from them.
3,"A great place to cut your teeth if you've never tried Thai before (although I can't imagine many people not having tried something). This place seems to trying to sway you towards a buffet rather than giving you things straight off the menu. My waitress seemed very adamant that we give that a try, almost like her life depended on it.\n\nI understood as soon as I got the bill, \u00a321 a head. The buffet was good, but I certainly didn't eat \u00a321 worth."
3,"Not great but not terrible. Just run-of-the-mill quality food at typical prices. The food isn't bad tasting, but it surely isn't the highest quality. On the flip side, it isn't trying to be. Egg Works embraces its mediocrity and prices appropriately.\n\nI will almost definitely eat here again because eating eggs is surely healthier than being lazy and eating donuts, for example, but the food is just okay, and the 3-star is labeled \""A-OK\"" by Yelp! so that must be the one I have to pick."
3,"Dear Breadfruit,\n\nYou would be worthy of four stars if you were not so utterly overpriced.\nI will, however, always take you up on a slice a dat sweet potato pie. \nAnd coffee, if you insist upon it.\n\n\nSincerely,\nRachel"
3,"It's not the best, not the worst. They do t advertise their specials, however they are good. The prime rib unlimited use to be to die for. Since they removed it I haven't been back. In reality, the price wasn't all that good for what the food taste was. All in all its on par with Denny's."
3,Really average food in buffet for lunch. It was a good selection but food was a little less than I would expect.
3,i cannot belive this place has not been reviewed this is a smalltown cafe with great and some times tweeky service not bad service just tweeky help but the breakfast here are very  good standard breakfast fair the interior is old cowboy john wayne/gene aughtrey kind of kitch fun breakfast place
3,"I need to per-qualify this rating by saying that I'm rating this off one dish. Unlike other posts here our server was very respectful and nice.  OK, let's get to it. I had the chicken Madeira. I cook a fabulous chicken Madeira but when I go to a classy place such as this I expect to be wowed. The anticipation was great as the build up came from the surroundings of such a modern restaurant with a very balanced darkness which completed the experience with atmosphere lighting.  You certainly felt upscale. Seeing the rest of my party being served certainly had an impact as their orders were very visually appealing. However, when I was served I found their chicken Madeira leaves a lot to be desired. It was definitely  a let down from first sight which unfortunately continued until the last uneventful bite.  The sauce was bland and not seasoned at all and carried none of the tastes you would expect from such a dynamic dish. While the sauce required more flavor for sure, the three chicken pieces I received were so small I almost laugh out loud, but managed to keep it under my breath. The only thing salvageable were the homemade French fries which I'm convinced you can't really mess that up having deep fried many homemade fries myself.  Didn't justify the $17.00 charge.. no way.    Just saying... stay clear of this dish..."
3,"Arrived to the Wynn pretty late at night, I was tired and wanted something quick to eat so, I checked out The Cafe.\n\nThey offered some great sandwiches, salads and desserts.  I orderd their Chicken Portabella sandwich.  I was a little put off that the sandwich was not made fresh, rather it was refrigerated, popped in an oven and served to you.  For $11.00 I would've expected a little more freshness.  But, I spread some of the Garlic Aioili it was served with, took a bite into it and it was very delish.  Add a bottle of Coke for $4.00 (ouch!) and I was good for the night.\n\nThe Cafe gets pretty busy in the morning for those that need that caffeine fix so, early bird gets the worm.  (IMO, take a morning stroll and walk over to Starbucks across the street at Fashion Show Mall.)"
3,"I have to admit I first came across the Krispy Kreme fuss about a decade ago in Canada and was kind-of put off in principle by the assertiveness of the guarantees that I would LOVE these doughnuts. \n\nA generous colleague arrived in this week with an enormous amount of doughnuts from Edinburgh's latest purveyor and, yes, they were very nice. The team was quite taken with the gesture and resultant greasy joy. The Krispy Kreme fuss had truly arrived in multifarious, sweet and doughy form. Everyone was entranced.\n\nI have to say though that despite the generosity of the free donuts, etc, and the pleasantness, I just don't see a hole big enough to require filling with so much sugar and grease. \n\nI also can't help wondering if we're back in the early 90s!\n\nSo, 3 stars for good taste. But that's it."
3,"Eh, the server seemed too busy to actually take care of our needs. The food was kind of dry. I ordered the Steak Gorgonzola and the pasta was dry. We also ordered the Pappardelle Pesctore. Didn't look anything like the picture and was very \""fishy\"" smelling. The Norther Tour of Italy was OK too. The salad was also lacking in dressing, like it was coming out of the servers pockets! The calamari was also bland tasting. We asked for more lemon for the calamari but didn't get it toward the end. The \""new\"" Italian style buffalo wings was dry. Why a three, because we are loyal Olive Garden people! We come here once every other month and normally we\nget EXCELLENT FOOD AND SERVICE. Maybe it was an off day?"
3,Nice place to eat on the cheap.  You'll get full or drunk off of what they have to offer for sure.  I believe they still provide free donuts and coffee for gamers in the early mornings.  This place is really old but why not try your luck?
3,Good food but sloooooooooow!\nTo start- we weren't seated until 20 minutes after our reservation time.  The waiting area/bar is tiny so there really isn't anywhere to wait- but in the pathway of people coming and going. \n\nWhen we were seated our waitress was also the hostess- I think it's time for them to get a dedicated hostess (along with about 3 more servers for the restaurant).  She was friendly and explained the menu to us.  We got mussels to start- they were delicious.  They were smaller (which I prefer) and the white wine sauce was great.  I would have preferred bread to the French fries but the server had told us the fries we out of this world- but they aren't; they are actually a little soggy.  The mussels were good enough though that I can overlook the fries.  \nI had the special- bouillabaisse for my entr\u00e9e- it came out piping hot (which I appreciate) and was loaded with delicious seafood and had a thick saffron sauce.  It was pretty awesome.\nMy husband had the brie stuffed chicken.  He said it was OK but not great.  \nOverall I was very impressed with the food- but the dinner for 2 with app and entr\u00e9e only lasted 2 hours!  If I came back it would have to be during the week and I would never consider going here with a group.  They definitely need more people working so that they can get more people in to eat the delicious food!
3,"I have only ever had the wonton soup here.  I order it without noodles and it is some of the best I've had.  I love the slightly sweet, aromatic broth and the dumplings are very good.  I've heard the other food is just so-so and I haven't tried it.  But I am a repeat customer for their wonton soup.  \n\nCheck out the Crown Bakery upstairs from this place - it's great."
3,"We had a great dining experience, however the food was just average. Great cocktail specials from 3-6pm! Wish we would have gone for an earlier dinner."
3,"This was my first time here. We sat in the bar and caught the tail end of happy hour. \nApparently that have complementary hors d'oeuvres, although I did not have any. \nWe had a few cocktails and ordered some Salmon and Yellow tail sashimi and nigri. I love good salmon and I must say their salmon is pretty good. The Yellow tail sashimi was cut too thick for my liking. \nMy biggest complaint was the smell of the restaurant. It smelled like a mix of disinfectant and cheap cologne. It was really strong and made me a little sick to my stomach..."
3,"Golden Phoenix is the kind of place you visit when you want a decent, inexpensive lunch. The place is rarely full during the week, especially if you arrive closer to 11am, so be prepared to eat your meal while the (slightly creepy) waitstaff sits at a nearby empty table and watches you eat.  The food is nothing spectacular, but it's decent quality, flavorful (although \""very, very spicy\"" is really closer to \""my tongue has a slight tingle\""), and dirt cheap.  Today I paid $16 and change before tip for myself and my friend, including soft drinks.  I'll keep coming back for the reasons I listed plus its close proximity to my office.  You can't beat a good deal!"
3,"I have made a couple visits over the years (I don't live in Champaign). Located along a major thoroughfare for the city and near campustown. The donuts are pretty good. Quick service. However, not all the donuts are in stock at a given time. I was just there and didn't even see glazed yeast donuts (the classic).- just glazed cake and the glazed minis. I appreciate having someplace to grab a snack with early morning Black Friday shopping."
3,My first visit. Wings were good. Service ok. Catfish not good but it is a wing place. I had the ATL seasoned wings. They were tasty but a bit salty. The cashier had a unwelcoming demeanor but she stayed on top of everyone's orders. I would go back for the wings and fries.
3,"Come here if you need a bit of southern flavor in the midst of all that is \""sin city.\""\n\nVENUE: Located inside treasure island hotel and opened SUPER late. So if you're not done partying and have gotten kicked out of every other place, this is a pretty good consolation prize. They play country music so if you like two-stepping and line dancing, come here. There's also a mechanical bull that you're able to try and ride if you've got the courage.  But watch out for, or just watch, the hot blond cowgirl. She'll put everyone to shame when riding the bull. Dance floor is pretty big and the place is relatively clean.\n\nFOOD: I did not have the pleasure of trying their food since the kitchen had closed by that point.\n\nSERVICE: Bartenders were funny and helpful. Drinks came out pretty quickly but because it wasn't that crowded that may have helped. The demographic of people that were there were a bit older than my group - maybe in their late 30s to 40s? Some were way over that. But regardless we had a lot of fun and most of us are huge country fans."
3,"I come here just because my friends like it. The food is not bad, somewhat pricey - except the pizzas, which are a good value. Beer is also a good value, but wine and other drinks are not. I'm personally not a fan of their beer - I find it too heavy and sweet, but if you want to get a group and get happy, this place is clean, geared to please, and its dishes are easy to share."
3,"Had lunch here and found it to be tasty and a good value.  I chose an albacore sandwich (tuna salad) and the pecan dijon salad for the 1/2 and 1/2 for $7+.  The salad was more like a warm compote made of chopped pecans, chicken, crunchy veg and a dijon cream dressing.  \nFriend chose an egg white veggie omelet and was able to make up a meal to fit her stringent diet."
3,"I went there with the kids. They wanted an \""ice cream\"" place that we haven't been to before. It was good, but the girls working there were a bit rude. They had a boyfriend there that they were talking to when we went in there and the girls were laughing the whole time we were trying to order. My kids and I liked the frozen yogurt though. We will probably go again."
3,"Pretty good, but I can think of other Mexican places I prefer. The service here was ATTENTIVE but a bit disorganized. I asked 3 different people to bring water for hubby and I (we were the last in our group to arrive) and we wound up with one water glass. However, they were quick to bring refills of chips and salsa, and checked on us frequently throughout the meal. The water glasses may have been a fluke because it was a pretty crowded table and we didn't have any other issues with the service.\nThe food was decent, if a bit spicy for my taste. Yeah, I know it is Mexican and I'm a wimp. No one else seemed to mind, so take that with a grain of salt. It did seem to sit a bit lighter than most Mexican food, so that was good. The margaritas were STRONG and a pitcher was more than enough for the 4 of us."
3,"Good enough for fast asian style food. Clean place with friendly staff. what the heck it is what it is and it is not horrible by any means. Fast, convenient, good price, and decent."
3,"Surprising there was no assembly required, no special tools and no missing parts to our meal. However it also lacked the value I would have expected from such a venue.\n\nJust to be clear this is the \""fancy\"" upstairs cafe not the food stand down stairs.\n\nThe selection is wider, including wraps, salads soups, and a hot tray line of what I assume are sweetish classics. \n\nMy wife had a veggie wrap, that was almost a chicken wrap as the shelves and labels were in disarray. It was neither great nor terrible at $4 it was acceptable.\n\nThe smoked fish plate for $7 was quite good, creamy horseradish sauce and mixed greens with a few beans accompanied the well smoked fish. \n\nThe nice touch was the vegan sweet potato soup.  Flash your ikea family card for some free stuff and you have a meal. at $14 for the two of us it was not pricey but we were eating in a self service furniture store. \n\nIf you are looking for some mild food in a kid friendly environment with great views of furniture this may be your spot."
3,"Other than the lack of an apostrophe there's very little wrong with this establishment  service was good (although the thought that we might have wanted food after having longer to study the menu whilst our teas were being prepared seemed to get lost somewhere), decor is pleasant (some very comfy chairs to stretch out in) and it benefits massively from the large expanse of window facing onto Frederick Street.\nFood and drink-wise there is nothing on the menu that you wouldn't expect from a cafe of this kind so if you're after a surprise or a new taste sensation you'll probably be out of luck but, whilst not breaking any records, they do what they do well.\nHaving not checked out the toilets on this visit (or the food for that matter) I'm hedging at 3 stars but would expect on current evidence that either of those things would easily push it to 4 the next time I pop in."
3,"I went here today feeling a bit meh. I was going to meet some clients, and they had chosen it - and I kept thinking of all the other groovy places in the area that we could have gone to instead. Cafe Grande just seems a bit old school, and the menu was all burgers and paninis...\n\nBut, in fact, i did have a pretty good lunch. The fishcake was small but tasty, with chips and a little salad - and the cheeseplate afterwards was good, with a choice of Scottish cheeses. Various desserts round the table looked decent too - the banoffee pie got a rave review.\n\nOther lunch choices weren't quite as good - the soup and sandwich in particular seemed a bit dull and \""like something you'd make at home\"", while the beanburger arrived looking forlorn on a plain bun.\n\nSo - a nice enough lunch if you're in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way."
3,"In my gluten-free quest, I crossed paths with Nello's.\n\nI had a ham-pineapple pizza. Super good for a g-f dough.\n\nThey have a list of ingredients (and toppings) that have gluten which narrows the options pretty bad.\n\nGreat service.\n\nIf you don't have super high expectations, this is a good place.\n\nCheers"
3,"The eyebrow threading used to be $8, but recently raised to $10--the typical price for threading around LV.  She does a good job not taking too much off and maintaining the natural shape of your brow.\n\nFacials are good here too, but they don't stay true to their coupon deals:  The usual facial is 1 hour full price.  My mom got a coupon for 50% off, but instead got 50% off of the time!  30 minutes for half the price = NO 50% DISCOUNT"
3,"I am just looking to my right... as I write and I just saw \""better that Roscoes\""... Not a chance...  But is good no doubt.  The problem is the chicken.  The chicken at Roscoe's is what one would describe as an addictive experience.  It's Crack... Once you have it you can quit.\n\nBack to Lolo's.  Nice place.  An improvement over Roscoe's in terms of the place.  Very colorful and big jars of Kool-Aid.  The chicken and the waffles are good... That is if You have never been in LA and had roscoes.\n\nThe breading of the chicken is dry and different.  The waffles and the syrup are great.  Need to improve the chicken thing.  I sure will be back as is definitely better than some fast food chicken but it ain't no roscoe's.\n\nOk in case you are wondering about Roscoe's.\n\nhttp://www.mixiaosblock.com/twin_cities_lunch/thats_some_darn_good_chicke.html"
3,"Just okay.  Service was good.  Beer was cold.  I'd prefer a good IPA though, which they didn't have.  \n\nFood was just average.  Standard chicken wings.  Sandwich bread was a little stale, fries not very crisp.  Ho hum.  \n\nNice decor inside, and lots of televisions, so it's a good spot for a beer and a ballgame.  Wood smoke from the pizza oven creates a great aroma, so maybe a pizza is the way to go next time."
3,"I unfortunately fell into the trap pf ordering chips and salsa first. Way too much food. But other than that, it was exactly what you would expect from a Mexican place. Big serves, as often happens in Mexican, and fresh ingredients. Nothing earth-shattering but reasonably priced. I would go back, next time I am in the area and in the mood for Mexican."
3,"I came here with my mom because she has an insatiable sweet tooth. She asked the girl behind the counter if the coffee flavored gelato had caffeine in it. The girl replies, \""I don't know. I don't make it.\""\n\nWe kind of laughed it off but then when I asked her if they had anything that was dairy-free she says, \""I don't know. I don't make it.\""\n\nAfter complete shock we just shook it off and ordered our gelato. My mother attempts one more time to get something useful out of this girl. She asks her to suggest another flavor to go with chocolate. The girl replies, \""I don't know. I don't eat it.\""\n\nI couldn't believe it. I mean sure she's probably in high school and it's true...she doesn't make it and most likely doesn't eat it. But hello....CUSTOMER SERVICE!\n\nBesides that the gelato was amazing and pretty okay priced. Banana Yum!"
3,The food was average and everything is overpriced. My friend and I were playing video poker the whole time yet only 1 drink was comped. Kinda disappointed because I was hoping to find a good hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint with video poker.
3,"UMM, can you say overrated? Either the people who rated highly of this buffet had not eaten at any other buffets in Vegas or they had a really off night when I came in!\n\nTHEY DEDICATE 1/4 OF THE BUFFET TO BREAD FOR GOODNESS SAKE! A $40 per person buffet that does this, really? The best thing I had here was the california roll and that was only because they used real crab meat in it! The service was also very good but that was because we sat at the bar. \n\nCan someone tell me what's so special about this buffet? If your response is prime rib, cold shrimp or crab, I have news for you  - EVERY BUFFET IN VEGAS OFFERS THESE ITEMS! & THEY WON'T CHARGE YOU $40 TO GET THEM!\n\nHere are some buffets that definitely tops the Bellagio: #1 Rio Carnival World Buffet, #2 Rio Seafood Buffet, #3 Wynn Buffet!"
3,"Holy crap, people actually eat here?  The last several times I've been to this RA, I can gauge my level of intoxication between pretty buzzed to blackout-absolutely wasted.  As you can tell, neither I nor any of my compatriots make it a point to actually dine here, mainly drink.  That's right, awesome happy hour and on Sunday night it's Service Industry Night (aka happy hour on Sunday night).  The happy hour menu is pretty extensive with appetizers ranging from the standard california roll to gyoza, seafood dynamite, and coconut shrimp skewer things.  However, where RA truly shines is it's specials on alcohol.  Food may be ordered when the hunger arises concurrently with inebriation, but at that point it doesn't matter if it's just so-so or even sub-par (it's like having beer goggles, but for food, not chicks).  However, I can't give this place a complete crap rating because of all the wonderful drunken memories I've had here (the few times I actually remembered the outings/the first half of the outing)."
3,"Hubby and I came here with friends. We had been exploring Luxor with them and wanted food so T&T was suggested.\n\nThere is a great amount of options on the menu and we had difficulty in deciding just what to eat. It seems though that whatever you order is great as we all loved the food. The food was a solid 5 stars!\n\nHOWEVER, the service. 2 stars. I had asked about the virgin margaritas, the waiter was snarky as he had supposedly read them out to someone else on the table. Had I heard him I wouldnt have asked. If hubby and I had been here alone then we would have told him to forget it and gone elsewhere seeing as his attitude was terrible. It seemed he just didnt want to be there at all. Not great for the restaurant at all.\n\nIf the service had been good then I think I would have been in a better position to give a great review opposed to just an ok."
3,"a good tho not great buffet. peel n eat shrimp and the dessert variety were the standouts. prime rib not very good, but oh they do get an extra star for the tequila-infused watermelon, you could get drunk off that stuff. also rice krispy pops & candy apples. i would have liked to see more salad variety to at least create the illiusion that I was eating healthy but i did like that there was a wide array of breakfast options even at 2 pm. I would probably go back but then Aria and Paris have much better choices on their buffets, I would probably chose those over Wynn. Sorry Steve!"
3,"AAAAAA...Excalibur is in a great location.....We checked in on a Saturday and we had a rooom in the newly remodeled tower 2. So we get to our room and we notice something funny the door isnt shut all the way, We just push our door open and the room is all clean and ready to go but apparently something is wrong with the door and it won't shut all the way.So we call and they say we'll be moving next door. They bring the keys up and everythings all good , room was nice remodeled flat screen nice beds etc......But what do you know the next day the same thing happens with the door in our room it wont shut all the way. What a joke we call and the send someone up to fix it.Pool area is nice, windy  as hell why we were there. Walls are paper thin could hear the tramps next door discussing certain things. Check out time is 11 am which sucks when youve been out getting intoxicated the night before. We called down and they extended our checkout till 12...so generous ......so to sum it up stay here if you want some place cheap in a good loacation with ok rooms."
3,"This buffet is more in line with a Golden Corral/Hometown Buffet than some of the higher-end buffets you'll find on the Strip. We came for brunch. It has all of the staples: salad bar, carving station, dessert bar, pizza, pasta, corn, mashed potatoes, roasted potatoes, green beans, fish dishes, sushi and a few Asian dishes, and bread. Nothing very imaginative, but you can certainly leave very full. Price isn't great, but better than others, and the line wasn't long. If you're just looking to fill up on a decent meal for a relatively low price, go for it. Foodies should head elsewhere."
3,"Food was decent- nothing that blew us away. Rice on the sushi seemed soggy.  Service was so-so. We felt rushed, timing of food was bad, and staff wasn't as knowledgable on the menu as I would expect for a place that has a lot of hype in this area."
3,Waitress was very friendly and provided great service.  Steak boxty was tasty and filling.  Went well with a pint of Harp.
3,"I think Abuelos is very good for a chain Mexican food restaurant. They are pretty consistent with nice servers and decent food. I remember a time when there were huge lines out the door and hour long waits, but maybe that was in spring training season because the last time I visited, we got right in with a party of 6. I will go there again with out of town guests because they seem to love it but i prefer to frequent local establishments if I can."
3,"I haven't had a chance to eat the food yet but I came on a night where there was a frat-party...I was a little skeptical about the age of the kids allowed in, during the frat party they did allow people who were underage in, and those who were of age wore wristbands...however that really didn't seem to stop kids from drinking; remove that and it was a fun atmosphere. They have beer pong, and the drinks are good. The design is really fun and alternative and my husband and I enjoyed watching the music videos, dancing around and having a few drinks."
3,"Good for a hangover.  It's a little loud however.  I've thrown up in the bathroom many times, not due to the food.\n\nThe fries are thin and kind of disappointing.  The food is good.  Not spectacular. It's decent.  The specialty drinks are strong, and that's a plus."
3,"I came here for a haircut because I was near here and needed a haircut.  I just get a standard men's regular scissor cut, so most places are basically the same.  I just walked in and there was no wait for one of the stylists, so I got my hair cut quickly and efficiently and everything was pleasant and pretty much what I expected.  The haircut was a better than average, and she clearly cared about doing it correctly, so that's nice.  But at $20 for a men's regular and no rinsing or product or anything it's a bit pricier (25% more) than other places in the area that produce similar results, but  it's still not a bad deal for a decent haircut."
3,"I should start with the positives.. The food here is excellent. I have been here many times and the bruschetta is out of this world..the best I have ever had. The service is here is awful!! We went on a Friday night and even with 3 bartenders behind the bar  and a near empty bar, it was impossible to get service. They were very interested in talking to eachother though. They take empty glasses away without offering refills and when the food arrived I had to retrieve some silverware and plates since the bartender(s) didn't even acknowledge that we needed anything. No joke, it took almost 10 minutes to get the attention of that bartender to get another glass of wine or a beer.\nThe food is what keeps us going back and they do have a great happy hour with $5 glasses of wine. We will try the other location next time to see if the service is any better there."
3,"My review is pretty much in synch with everyone else's.\n\nGood:\nThe food (when you finally get it)! Standouts: Lobster and Corn lawd jesus. The Gin drink named after royalty. Can't remember the name but it was great! \nThe varied menu - So many cool things to try. \nThe drinks - Delicious, inventive, tons of them to try and MANY weekly specials (see below).\n\nThe Bad:\nThe service...I mean I saw 3 people in black shirts standing around, and TWO hostesses. Do you need that many people taking you to your table? I mean, it's self seating...for the most part.\n\nLastly, the bartender was working her BUTT off. She was hustling like she was in that movie about having Flow. Get it girl. I just think, Management needs to talk to the rest of the staff. It's almost...irritating to see so many people just standing around. \n\nBottom line: Really good food, really great drinks, poor service.\n\nHere are some of the daily drink specials:\n\nMargarita Monday-$3 off specialty margaritas from 7pm-close.\nGuys Night Out Tuesday-1/2 off whiskey, bourbon, and scotch from 7pm-close.\nPaper Bag Beer Special Wednesday- random beer in a bag for $1 from 7pm-close.\nLadies Night Thursday-$3 off glasses of wine and $3 360 vodka drinks from 7pm-close.\nFireball Friday-$2 shots of Fireball from 7pm-close.\n$10 Mimosa Carafes Saturday-Get a mimosa carafe for $10 from 11am-3pm.\n$10 Bloody Mary Carafes Sunday- Get a bloody mary carafe for $10 from 11am-3pm."
3,"Solid & nice place for Italian food. Lovely atmosphere & good location just off the Square. Portions are huge and prices are reasonable, especially given portion size!"
3,"Friendly service, dated rooms but it's well worth it for the price paid.  The adjoining rooms are a big plus when traveling with kids"
3,"Not the best burger by any means, but passale   Horrendous setup by the drink machine almost impossible to get by because it is so crowded and tiny aisle to go past"
3,"Friendly staff...young crowd...everybody seems to be desperate to get laid....the underground area is pretty boring....there is a \""dance floor\"" where nobody dances, it lacks ambiance, no mirror ball, no lights, no laser beams...if you want people to dance and have a good time spend a bit of money and create some ambiance."
3,"Champaign is a great restaurant city, but the options for Middle Eastern food are rather limited, so I'm glad that Holy Land Grill exists.  It isn't the best Middle Eastern food I've ever had, but it's pretty good.  I was there yesterday and had the falafel and a Greek salad and enjoyed both.  Service was attentive and friendly, which was a welcome change after the last few times we'd been there.  They started our meal with complimentary bottles of water, which seemed odd and wasteful (but I suppose washing water glasses wastes resources, too.)  They also serve Mexican Coca-Cola, which was an interesting change of pace.  Dessert was baklava-very good but came topped with a simple syrup that didn't do much for it.  Serving the baklava plain or with a drizzle of honey would have been better.  One more thing;  I know I'm always complaining about loud music in restaurants, but there was no music at all at Holy Land. Some soft Middle Eastern music would have been a nice touch.  All in all, I enjoyed my meal at Holy Land and plan to return soon."
3,"The Golden Nugget buffet is under construction so we were able to use the buy-one-get-one-free coupons at Carson Street Cafe.  Sweet.\n\nAs a Golden Nugget guest, I loved that the Carson Street Cafe was located so close to the elevators.  After a long day walking up and down the Strip, it was nice to be able to grab a bite to eat and then head back to the room.\n\nThe food is decent.  I would recommend sticking to the basics.  My BLT was fine and the chicken in the Caesar salad was really tender and tasty.\n\nThe customer service varied from person to person but it did seem to be on the slow side overall."
3,A kind of cool place to get a drink and a snack. Pay with cash to avoid awkwardness. Don't go there for customer service.
3,"Update: Too much of a good thing is a bad thing. For the last two months we were probably at BIg View twice a week. The service and food seemed to trail off during the holidays, and just after Christmas we were even sold extremely stale and old cookies from their bakery. Because of this we haven't been back in the New Year.\n\nPrevious Review: The hubby and I eat here about once a week. Have had a ton of things on the menu and everything has always tasted great. Breakfast plates, french toast, pancakes. Shrimp & grits, chicken souvlaki, spinach pastry, greek salad, crab cake. All tasty! And we love their bakery. The service is generally very friendly and on point. Don't recommend eating at the bar in view of the kitchen because it gets chaotic, but otherwise enjoy dining here. Definitely recommend."
3,"This location was right across from the campus theater, and we were in the area for a show, so this was definitely a convenient spot.  We walked in and were seated right away and our drink orders were taken really quickly too.\n\nIt was a little rough in the middle of after drink orders, since it took about 15 minutes after that to have our orders taken and to get our drinks. The hostess ended up stopping by our table to take the order - which we guess was due to the fact that our waitress probably was a little overwhelmed. \n\nThe food came out about 15 minutes after ordering and we had to eat quickly to ensure we didn't miss our show time. I had the Turkey Dinner and he had one of the pancake combos (the white chocolate raspberry I believe was the name). My turkey dinner was just okay.  The turkey was cut into small pieces, and definitely wasn't the long cut strips like it was in the picture on the menu (but it never is right?).  His pancakes were a good pick - the Egg Nog pancakes looked like they would have been a good pick, too!\n\nI paid our ticket as soon as I was done eating so that we could take off as soon as my fiancee was done.  \n\nOverall: B-\nService was good.  Food was okay - definitely an \""A-OK\"" visit."
3,"Was at the W last night for a Bachelorette Party.  Clearly, I don't get out much... well, at least not to hoity-toity Scottsdale spots... so I was floored by the ridiculous $16 drinks.  No, thanks! Water, please!  \n\nThe people-watching was topnotch.  The girl prancing around the lounge in her tiny turquoise bikini is still making me laugh... seriously - cover it up.  You are inside and the sun isn't shining!\n\nThe pretty waitresses that are all stuffed into teeny, tiny black dresses were very friendly and happily separated the check into smaller tabs for our large group.  \n\nCertainly, the W is a good place to go and drop tons of money... and do some hilarious people-watching of the Scottsdale crowd... but it really isn't my thing."
3,"I am subtracting two stars here based on an experience I had this week.  Was here for drinks on a Tuesday night, the place wasnt packed so my friend and I sat at the bar.  There were two bartenders but obviously their friends were at the bar and they had zero interest in serving anyone else.  It took 15 minutes to get the menu, the bartenders could not have been ruder!!!  When i asked for a beer they didnt have she threw the beer list at me and didnt come back for another 15 minutes.  It was probably some of the worst service I have seen in Charlotte!  Take some midol beotch!!!"
3,"We came down to the buffet since it was the closest place to get some breakfast food on a Sunday morning. It was pretty good for taking the elevator down and have a choice of just about any kind of food you want. I don't think you can expect lobster and crab at 11:00am in the morning, but you will get some things like prime rib and other nice cuts of meat. \n\nIf you're not gambling then you're probably going to pay full price at like $25 or more. Coming from Chicago this is a pretty steep price. You're only in Vegas so much, so why not right? I would probably go back here again if I could eat twice as much or if I had a huge amount of comps. If you got money to blow, you're really hungry and don't want to go far from the hotel, then you can get away with eating here and being happy about it."
3,"The Yard House, for me anyway, is strictly a happy hour stop.  The beer selection is first rate with too many on tap to count.  The food specials during HH are great.  The entrees are ok but if you're in this neighborhood you have dozens of better options."
3,"The Big Dogs on Sierra was closed, we always went there when we were in town at least twice for the beer and Nachos so we trekked over to the Draft house on Rancho.  Nachos were a disappointment compared to what we used to get.  The beer is good but we were sadly disappointed in our favorite nachos."
3,"Good food, but overpriced  The wait is long during peak hours, but that is to be expected for most buffets in Vegas.  If the price was half the price, then I'd give the buffet at Bellagio 4 stars.  Unfortunately, the quality of the food does not justify the price of the buffet.\n\nBottom line, your money would be better spent elsewhere for the same quality of food at a lower price.  You can gamble your savings away at the slot machines and maybe win a jackpot instead."
3,"Close to my house so I like to go get their vegetarian or supreme pizza and enjoy a pitcher of cold beer with wings while watching sports on their numerous tvs.  The place has gotten a little pricier with the food quality not staying as good as it was, but I like the atmosphere, service and take out.  Big selection of pizzas available and this is what you come here for.  The other foods are just for those who want variety."
3,Love Grand Lux. Corned beef hash is excellent.  \n\nOne big problem during his visit was the Mrs found a hair in her fries. Waiter and manager handled it properly tho. Took it off our check and profusely apologized. \n\nDesserts r fantastic.
3,"Here's the thing: The service at Tea Lite (i swear it says Tea LIGHT on the sign, but maybe not) is great, everyone is super nice, food comes out real quick and it's also real healthy. You also get a great meal for your dollar. What is keeping me from giving them a higher rating is that it's too safe.\n\nI love to come here for a quick, healthy, inexpensive lunch, but if I want the real stuff I'll go to the competing restaurant a little ways away. The ph\u00f4 at Tea Lite Caf\u00e9 is sorta gentrified, a product of the neighborhood that it's in. There's no tripe or tendon in the broth, and there's no option to add it in if you desire a dish a little more adventurous. There are plenty of options if you want to spice it up, but not if you want to add more general flavor to the soup that i expect to enjoy when i go to a Vietnamese restaurant. Maybe it's because their specialty is a quick lunch and therefore a more streamlined menu? I am however super grateful that's one of the few places in the Airpark vicinity where I can get a boba tea!\n\nNow, I am no way condemning this restaurant, and in fact I recommend that you go there for lunch and support them, and if you like, request some of the omitted goodies for your ph\u00f4 so that someday they'll change their menu up and I can grant them a couple more stars."
3,"I went here based on a couple reviews and I was expecting something fabulous.  The food was really good! Four stars for the food but two for the service equals a three star review.  What went wrong?  It took about 45 min's for a couple of pita sandwiches and we were the only ones there, and when the order came it was wrong!  My friend had to get his to go while I ate mine.\n\nDon't get me wrong the food is really good and I would probably go back but come on people please get the order right, and speed up the service a little! Maybe somebody should tell them or leave a Yelp card to let them know that we love the food, but the service needs to be improved!"
3,"Ive been here a handful of times and it is always packed and a good time for me.  We had a VIP table which always helps getting in and enjoying the time spent there. The DJ music was good to dance to, but the dance area is tight. They offer a platform pole where several women get up and dance on so that is fun to watch. This time the large private back room area was closed....renovations?! The private area last time is separated from the main area and offers private tables and dance areas for larger groups and a separate DJ.  Not a bad place to come with a group, but not so great for just a couple guys. There are better options in Vegas."
3,"I bought the onion and mushroom poutine and a Montreal smoke meat sandwich.  The sandwich was very good.  The meat was warm and so moist.  Very good.  \nThe poutine was ok, I wish I bought something with bacon or something also meaty to enhance the flavour.  I did like the onion and mushroom though, but just thinking about the possibilities.\n\nThe weird thing is, maybe because I was in a hurry, I under tipped.  The waiter asked me if there was something wrong with the service but honestly there was nothing wrong with it but nothing exceptional either.  I happened to go early on a Saturday morning, right when the store opened.  So after I told him nothing was wrong, he informed me that in Montreal the tipping is 15%.  So he asked me for $1.50 more.  I felt embarassed because I wasn't paying attention and I just wanted to give him a flat $30 after eating $26 something. Maybe I am cheap.  Before entering, my brother and I wanted to see how much their poutine was, and already they were shouting at us that it was not opened yet.  So the food was good, but I'm not sure about the service.  I still gave it a chance after being shooed away."
3,one of the nicest view rooms ive stayed at nothing to go crazy over but liked how it was located right at the miricle mile shops
3,"I like how large this place is and the different seating options to suit your needs.  This is a great place to meet up with people, close to the freeway- I see business men meeting up here, I've had study groups here and I meet with my tutor here.  Coffee and tea is consistently good.  Free wi-fi - make sure you ask for the password when you grab your drink.\n\nThey lost a star because it's kinda dirty in there - messy tables and trash on the ground."
3,Good drink selection with some interesting cocktails and was pretty empty when I was there in the afternoon. I didn't try any food but it looked pretty good.
3,"3.5 stars.\n\nLike others say, it's better than airline lounges in US in terms of food and beverage offering. Cookies, cheese, some vegetable/hummus/cold pasta salad, cous cous and spring rolls and mini quiche. And full bar with wine, liquors and beverage. Also soup...\n\nSitting area can get crowded and it's closed after morning around 10:30 am and re-open at 2:30 pm.  Well.. better than sitting in the hallway.."
3,The calamari was fantastic. The tacos were nice but there are better ones around. Our server was very funny and definitely enhanced the experience. Worth checking out.
3,"It was a fun time and very much like the amazing race.  However, I was expecting more brain teasers that wouldn't be answered just by using a smart phone.  Must be in shape and ready to run if you actually want to win! They did forget to give the winners their 100 dollar gift certificate, but when brought up, the workers said they would mail it to them."
3,"Four of us went for breakfast.  2 of us had the $5.99 steak and egg special, which includes house fried potatoes (which are amazing) and toast.  2 of us had the veggie omelet, which was packed with fresh veggies, smothered with cheese, and also served with potatoes and toast.  With coffee and tip, total bill was less than $35. Great deal.  \nService was very good, servers were really friendly and refills of coffee/water were abundant.\nWe returned for dinner the next day.  2 of us had the penne al forno, which was creamy and delicious.  2 of us had the burgers with no complaint.  The best part-- $2.25 20 oz. beers that are brewed in house.  Both the Hefe and the Light are very smooth.  Total bill for 5 beers and 4 entrees was $45, a steal for being walkable from the strip."
3,It's a small hole in the wall place that my boyfriends co worker told him about. We went for his birthday dinner . The place is small with a few booths and tables but clean. The service was good and we didn't have to wait long to get our food. They have happy hour all day everyday so the price is pretty good. The food was good but not great. I really like the baked salmon and baked  scallops and the fried tofu appetizer. Do not get the fried calamari! No flavor and it just tasted like tempura batter
3,"I bought a Groupon for cut, all over color and style. The services I received were great, my stylist listened to what I wanted and delivered on my vision. The reason I am giving this experience 3 starts was due to the following two issues:\nThe stylist had my color mixed in her bowl and just as she started to do my hair she informed me that if she ran out of color and needed to mix a second bowl I would have to pay an additional $15. I was shocked and felt cornered as at that point I could not say no nor change what I wanted for my hair. I would not have had an issue if this was clearly explained to my either on my Groupon or when we first started talking about my hair. \nThe shirt I was wearing was ruined because my hair color bled through the robe. When I showed this to the stylist she spoke to her manager who just stated it should come out in the wash. I have not tried this yet but I double it will."
3,"Going to  keep it simple. \nPro's \nAtmosphere- very good job. TV's everywhere.  \nService-friendly-pretty ladies\nBeer is definitely cold!\nMenu is limited. We ordered a variety of stuff that came out ok(bar food).Portions, price ok . We had sandwiches which were fine and a Cobb Salad.  \n\nCon's\nFor lasting power in an area with lots of bars and competition they need to cater to the locals-\n- No Happy Hour\n- limited menu\n- No advertised food or drink specials\n-Not open 24hrs\n- Pricey for drinks\n-UFC $10 per person- but they carry it.\n-limited wine menu-really not much at all and horrible selection.\n-No pitchers of beer or bottles of wine for purchase.\n-Football season will be interesting because all other places offer specials during the games. \nThe splash is now since its new however, I'm confident someone will consider a few of the above. With that said it's worthy of a visit."
3,"This review is long overdue! I honestly find myself at Miller's very often.... there is always someone at working promoting a happy hour and since Miller's is close to the office and convenient for most, we always end up here.  They always have drink specials and the beer selection is good. The food is ok, bar food and nothing that stands out as a must try item. There are lots of tv's to watch filled with the sports events of the day.  The staff can be hit or miss.... I have had excellent service here and then I have had some horrible service.\n\nBut when you have a great group of friends with you- you can always have a good time here!"
3,"Decent coffee. Pretty nice place. I like the \""back space\"" they have - it's usually crowded with student who wants to read book or work on homework in a relaxed setting. \n\nBring cash; they don't take credit card. There is a ATM machine inside if you don't mind withdrawing your money with $2 fee.\n\nBy the way, the barista guy is so hot."
3,Looking for old fashioned soul food? You have defiantly found the right place. The fried chicken and cornbread was really good. Lots of sides to choose from.\n\nThe service was good. Defiantly a good place for lunch if you are downtown!
3,"I hope they fired the idiotic valet driver that almost ran me over just to beat a red light, and ended up smashing into another hotel guest's Hyundai. \n\nDisregarding the fact that they hired a psycho maniac driver, I can't complain too much about The Mirage. Rooms are offered at a decent price, but have been noticeably steeper than what they were in the past. The exotic gardens located at the main entrance make a great photo op. Every dining venue in this building is a tasteful experience and not one to be missed. I especially recommend Japonais, Kokomo, & Samba. And last, but not least, there's a considerable amount of tables scattered amongst the casino grounds. I've seen the basic black jack limits start from $5-15, so it's not a bad place to start off if you're a small gambler. It's a shame they don't pay out for quad aces in the poker room. I've hit some of my biggest winning  pots here, yet no extra cash for the rare obtainable hands. \n\nBased on a great location on the strip and being close to all the nearby hot spots, I'd recommend staying here. Just remember to look carefully before crossing the street..."
3,"The rooms are dark. They should have more light in the room. Also there's no fridge or microwave. I understand not having an microwave. The LCD TV is small, I think it's a Phillips 32\"". The hot water is not hot enough when you take a shower or bath. The big negative is that here's a Resort Fee (about $20). They should just add this to grand total not try to hide it. \n\nI watched the Pirate show in front of the hotel which was okay. My room was in the back on the 8th floor and I was surprise that we can not hear the sound from the pirate show which is a plus.\n\nThe good part about Treasure Island is that the hotel is in the middle of the strip. Well, to me the hotels between Wynn and Paris Paris/Bellagio (maybe Planet Hollywood) are the central of attraction. Anything beyond it you're not missing much. You might want to visit Fremont Street also."
3,"What can I say about Panchos... its a buffet with lots of mediocre Mexican food. Upon first entering the strange multiple sectioned building with lots of loud colors on the walls, you must enter a cafeteria style line and pick what you would like. Here, you have all kinds of stuff to choose from: greasy chili rellenos (aka cheese sponges), several types of enchiladas, tamales, small chimichangas, flautas and taquitos, rice, beans, tacos, and tostadas. The cost is pretty reasonable for all the food you can get and if you like non authentic greasy Mexican food made with lots of trans fat, this might be an ok deal for you. Once seated, you can obtain more items from the buffet simply by raising a little flag at your table. I will admit, this might just be the best idea ever! You raise this flag and the waiters are standing at your table literally seconds later. If only all restaurants would get on board with this! All in all, Panchos is an alright spot for a large unhealthy meal. The service is always good thanks to the flag system and it actually seems like a fairly clean restaurant. Also, who can resist fresh hot sopapillas after your meal? I know I can't, which is why I reluctantly agree to go to Panchos when the hubby asks (he loves those cheese sponges)."
3,"This is one of the newest Starbucks located on the strip, but it's not a real one, but a Starbucks in name only. \n\nYes they except the Starbucks gift card, but they also except the total rewards cards which makes it not an official Starbucks. Another giveaway is they jack up the prices!\n\nI ordered a passionfruit iced tea with a splash of strawberry. Normally my drink would cost me about $2.85. The young lady told me my drink cost almost 6 dollars. I did not question them, I just gave them my Starbucks card and took my drink.\n\nThis place is pretty big, plenty of outlets to plug-in, and plenty of selection of other items including the \""you are here\"" Vegas mugs, juices, sandwiches, etc. \n\nI'm giving this place three stars because of the outrageous price increase. I understand it's a business, but doubling the price for a drink that normally cost me less than three dollars is insane."
3,"There is a long hallway to get in so it is definitely pretty secret. There is not much seating inside, about 6 seats. You have to wait for your pizza, atleast 20 minutes so I would call ahead. \n\nThe pizza was alright, I honestly like Slices in Dublin, CA so much more. If I were in Las Vegas again I would not come by here but it was a nice expierence."
3,"Food was really good,  I've been to other Popeyes and was nOt impressed but this one just may change my mind...it will take more than one visit to determine that. I do wish there was a menu prior to the order menu in the drive thru, just because I'm not familiar with their menu and felt rushed once I was at the order menu. Also I given my box of food....no bag just my box of food which I thought was weird, would've liked a bag to carry my food from my car back to work (along with my purse, drink and other stuff).... and no straw for my drink (that's always annoying) but food wAs good so next time I'll walk in and check it out"
3,"This is a solid three. I'm still not sure how I feel about super thick pepperoni as I do prefer the thin sliced stuff. Overall, the pizza wasn't bad, but not exactly what I think of when I think of New York style thin crust. I tend I picture something a little different, maybe more like a Villa or Verrazano.  I'm not a fan of black edge crust either, a dark golden brown is my own preference. They definitely spent a bunch remodeling it from the old Atlanta bread Company that was there.  That being said I'm not from New York although I have been there and have had a couple different slices of pizza.  I will probably go again, but not sure if this will make it to the regular rotation."
3,"They no longer put the chicken back on the grill when you order. The chicken is not big chunks of white meat anymore, it is stewed chicken sitting in a broth all day and I'm not even sure it is all white meat anymore. Another issue is the woman who was making the burrito used her gloved hands to fill the burrito with all the toppings. That is fine for rolling, but when your sticking your hand (gloved or not) into each bin of lettuce, corn, tomatoes, cilantro, etc, it just doesn't seem normal. They need to use spoons on thongs for the fillings."
3,"Oh nostalgia! I was always confused, is it Lu-Lu's Noodles or Yum Wok? \nBeing a Pitt student you didn't have the best variety of food to choose from for what your wallet could afford. I remember them being cheap and close. They didn't deliver though which was a bummer on those cold days when there was brown slush to walk through. \nStill, for me and my friends, it was worth the wet jeans and laughs as we tried not to slip, fall, and drop our food as we trekked back up cardiac hill to our dorm."
3,"Nothing special, but a bank. \nThey have a convinient, safe on-location drive thru and walk up service. Of course, personal safety is always an issue so just be 'aware' of your surroundings. \nThere is a Smith, Nail place and other business in this corner. Definitely a convinient location."
3,"I don't normally go into American Apparel. Mostly because I like vintage and things that are skintight don't look good on me. But, I was dressing up as a mermaid and found myself in need of a top to wear under my shells so I didn't expose too much skin. Of course, American Apparel had all the selection of shiny, skintight (and skin colored) tops I needed. While I feel like I way over-paid for what I got, at least I got what I needed."
3,"The Saloon feels very corporate and a bit overpriced.  However, the service is also good, and the beers are always cold.\n\nI do not like the set up of the Saloon and the Comedy Zone.  I don't like how you have to go through the Saloon to get to the Comedy Zone.  Poor design lay-out.  I have been here on more than one Saturday night and had my night somewhat interrupted by huge crowds waiting in line to get into the Comedy Zone.  It sucks for everyone that is in the Saloon chillin, having a good time.  The bathrooms are packed and there is literally a human traffic jam towards the rear of the Saloon.\n\nI usually go to the Saloon when looking to pregame before a show at the Fillmore, or before heading to another location within the Music Factory on Friday and Saturday nights.   \n\nIt is what  it is.  The live music and DJ there on Saturday nights are a huge plus.  Its still your standard, corporate, expensive bar in Charlotte.  With that being said, I would definitely go back again."
3,"I'm begining to feel slightly bafffled as to the point of video / DVD rental shops these days. In HMV, new DVDs are down to about \u00a35 within a month or so of release, so why you'd bother spending almost that amount just to borrow one for a night is a bit of a mystery.\n\nOn the plus side, they are aware of the onset of cheap DVDs themselves, and a rake through their bargain bins often uncovers a fairly recent, or fairly excellent  film at a bargain \""to buy\"" price. They do good deals on video games too."
3,"I wanted to give this five stars. I really did. \n\nLast year, my fianc\u00e9 and I attended the festival and had an absolutely wonderful time. The food was wonderful and the music was diverse. Then we went to the jousting match, whose host turned out to be one of the most despicable people I've ever come across. \n\nHe first humiliated a spectator by asking her to bounce for him (then offering her money to do it, then telling her daughter not to grow up like her mother when the mother refused), before using the event to espouse his political ideologies.\n\nRenaissance festivals should be fun, family-friendly events. Furthermore, all cast members should be held to the expectation that they will operate in character throughout the day. I would love to give this a second go come October, but if that man is going to be present, I will have to decline."
3,"We went for the breakfast buffet which is at $ 20. There was a queue outside but when we got in there were empty tables so don't understand the queue. The server was good kept topping up our orange juice regularly. The ambience is not so great though. There is an omlette live counter which is quite good n they have crabmeat and shrimp as toppings. There was also salads, pizza, softee machine, fruits etc. What we really liked were the omlettes, danish, almond croissants, turkey sausage,waffles. Most stuff was good. Pancakes weren't tat great though, there was a guy making them but I guess the backlog made them cold n not so fresh. The muffins were dry. Not bad overall though. Definitely worth a try."
3,"I was really looking forward to this:  A burger.  A nice, BIG, juicy, fresh, yummy burger at a sit down restaurant that specializes in burgers.  This was going to be my first visit to Fuddruckers and I had high expectations.\n\nWell, eh.\n\nYeah, it was a burger.  Good but not great.  Not bad, just not exciting.  Nothing special to see here--just a burger.  I thought In n Out tasted a good deal better.  They're a lot cheaper too.\n\nIf someone suggests Fuddruckers to me sometime again as a place to eat, I'll go, but if you ask me for a destination if you're looking for a patty between two buns, there are a number of other places that I would suggest instead of it if you gave me the chance."
3,"First, let's be clear. The Mickey Mouse mural came with the restaurant (it was on the wall before Pho Nhat moved in). OK, now that THAT is out of the way...\n\n#42, how I love you! I love you for your barbecued beef, shrimp, and eggroll all lovingly plopped onto a giant bed of vermicelli noodles with leafy greens beneath! I cannot help but adore your fish sauce, and I will keep coming back for more. I shall not stray from you, #42. You are the only one for me.\n\nUpdate: The last time I went here, the staff didn't seem very happy to have my (and my friend's) business. Maybe I will try some other pho. It's a bit sad that they haven't upgraded anything in this place either. You would think that a bit of paint wouldn't cost TOO terribly much?"
3,"Rehab was okay.  I went today around 1pm expecting extreme lines and expensive cover, but it was only $60 to get in and the wait was less than half an hour for a single guy with no females.  The security is also not as bad as others have mentioned.  It lasted only 3 seconds since I only had a car key, credit card, and ID.\n\nWhen I walked in, there was a lot of people and most of them were attractive.  However, it wasn't as packed as it looks on video and in photos.  Even at 4pm it wasn't that packed, which I guess is a good thing.  Not a lot of people were dancing and only two people were making out.  In other words, Rehab is NOT as crazy as you're thinking it is!!\n\nFinally, the drinks are extremely expensive, and I'm talking $28 for a single drink, but buckets of Heineken Light were only $25 (5 beers).  Honestly I wouldn't come back here though, because it really wasn't that crazy."
3,"Been to this place for bday parties and although many prefer such a place to celebrate a birthday, I am not one of those people. It smells and the people who work here aren't the friendliest. I only gave it 3 stars because it's quite entertaining for kids."
3,"I only had the beer, but I was very happy with this brewery's take on a wheat beer. The bar is very nice and designed in a square with the tvs and bartenders in the middle. There's a nice litte fishtank in the middle as well. The crowd was pretty small for a super bowl night, but decent. There was also an adjacent bar with table tops for two and stools. If you are staying in Middleton and are not trying to travel too far into Madison, this is a good stop."
3,"My recent breakfast at Perk was OK.  The food was good, but the lackluster service will make me think twice about coming back.\n\nMy mom and I both enjoyed our breakfast burritos (mine with bacon and hers with ham).  They were smaller than I anticipated, but tasted good, especially when topped with the side of cilantro jalapeno sauce.  However, our waitress was pretty brusque - no interaction at all after taking our orders.  It would have been nice if she could have managed to come by to check on us, refill our water/my mom's coffee or even make eye contact at all.  The restaurant was NOT busy - less than half of the tables were occupied.  \n\nI had to ask the hostess for both a water refill and our bill.  When our waitress finally showed up with the check, she slapped it on the table without even breaking her stride, all while looking out the window.  Hello!?  No 'thank you', or 'have a nice day'.\n\nEh...  I can make my own breakfast burrito, thanks."
3,Me and the boyfriend decided to stop by this spot one night for some cheap drinks. This was my boyfriend's go to spot for a cheap drink when he lived in AZ. I already knew it was a dive bar when I pulled up so I'm not going to complain about the ambiance and restrooms... it's a dive bar! It was pretty low key the night we went so I ordered my Tokyo tea and asked the bartender for the gadget thing so we could play the trivia game that shows on the screen. I also ordered the honey hot wings which were surprisingly delicious!! On our way out we peeked in the karaoke room and it looked like people were having a ball! A good no frills spot for cheap drinks and wings!
3,"Loving anything that contains phyllo and/or spinach so I'm up for trying any Greek restaurant at least once for the Spanikopita or Baklava.\n\nSpanikopita was nice, used the feta from my salad to help flavor the dish even more, which I ususally do anyway, even when I make it at home.  \n\nNice portion size, great price, quick and freindly atmosphere, just a cozy neighborhood lunch/dinner spot, came back a second time for lunch, will return whenever I visit Madison."
3,"Beerarita?  Um yes please!!!  The quesadilla was totally stuffed with chicken, however could have used a little more flavor.  The chips/salsa was yummy and the salsa was exactly what the quesadilla was lacking."
3,"I thought this restaurant was just okay. My rating is based on the food vs price. The one thing I didn't like is that everything is a la carte. I ordered the Caesar salad which was good. It was pretty big and I didn't finish all of it. My husband ordered the basic hamburger. It was just okay, nothing special for the price with no sides. I would only dine here again if the other restaurants were too crowded."
3,Good coffee & tea. A little loud on the radio and blenders constantly whirring... But good wifi and now that I know how to get there will use often...
3,Service is good. Was kind of hard to find bc it's located in a strip mall facing rural north of Guadalupe. Food portions are huge but taste wise just ok. I had the everything omelet and hubby had the Scottish eggs Benedict. The Benedict sauce was good but bread a bit tough. Omelet was just ok w home fries and English muffin.
3,"I came here with 2 of my girlfriends after stopping by some stores in the mall. The place is ok, your average BBQ type place. They gave us jalape\u00f1o bread to start with which was pretty good. I ordered a turkey sandwich that had stuffing and cranberry sauce on it (thanksgiving on a roll pretty much). It was good but very dry. Although I do not drink myself, my friend was very upset that she couldn't get a PBR because they don't carry it. And the waitress said most people want one considering it's the name of the ace, but they don't serve them. \n\nThe waitress was super sweet and when one of our burgers wasn't cooked enough she quickly took it back. The place is average, but the decor is nice, the service is good and after a long and tiring day, their food hits the spot."
3,I had the 'Juan Turkey Wrap' and was sadly very disappointed in it. I am usually not one for healthy food but thought i would give this place a try.\n\nIt was just tasted like mush in my mouth and was no flavorful at all. You could not discern and of the different ingredients and just didnt taste very good. Ended up just dousing it in hot sauce.\n\nI am going to try and give this place another try and perhaps try ordering from the 'happy' side of the menu
3,"Stopped in for breakfast and tried the Mediterranean Omelette (it was JUST ok). I wouldn't consider this food 'gourmet' as they advertise. The prices are fair for the amount of food you receive; I spent $22 on three people. There is not a huge variety of items, what you see is what you get. \n\nI SO appreciated the plastic utensils; most restaurants use 'dishwashers' and you just NEVER know. What irks me is that most restaurants--this one included--give you one napkin. What can I possibly do with one napkin? I'm far from sloppy, but if you're not going to have a dispenser of sorts on the table please leave more than one on the table.\n\nThe service was mediocre at best. But the appearance itself is nice; nestled in Old Downtown Chandler across from the park (it was easily accessible and there was plenty of parking. \n\nOAN...they have one bathroom, which creates a ridiculous line in the narrow hallway.\n\nMy overall experience wasn't horrible, I just can't say that I'd be back anytime soon."
3,"Considering the location, it's not too bad. Not the best Chinese food I've ever had but not horrible. It's somewhere in between Panda Express and real authentic Chinese food."
3,"Juicy Pho off the strip\n\nThis place is pretty good for Vegas Pho. Vegas Pho is not the same as SGV Pho. \n\nOrdered the pork chop rice. It wasn't that good and the amount of pork chop there was very small.\n\nAte some of  my friend's korean bbq ribs, it was pretty good. \n\nAte some of my friend's Pho, it was decent. \n\nWhat was really good was the Egg Roll wrapped with lettuce. It was delicious!!!!\n\nKinda far from the strip, was driving at least 10-15 mins to get here."
3,Cheap burgers for a fancy price. Reminded me of those rubber burgers you got in grade school. Not worth the $10 I spent. I won't be going back soon.
3,"This place was \""OK,\"" but I probably wouldn't go back. Food was kind of low end Chinese although service and atmosphere were fine. Not really bad, just not good either."
3,"I come here to play poker and occasionally watch a movie.  If you come here you will reek of smoke.  This is worse than the Korean BBQ aftermath when you smell like kalbi.  I end up washing my clothes immediately after I'm here because I smell like an ashtray.   \n\nThe poker room has tons of tables and lots of action  - mainly senior citizen.  I'm usually the youngest at the table I'm in my 30's.  \n\nFood options are decent - Fuddruckers, Subway, and then their oyster bar is decent but obv not as good as Palace Station."
3,"Colectivo is a pretty neat and new-ish coffee shop right on the north east corner of the Capitol square.\n\nIt's got a pretty rustic and hipster kind of feel. Cool music, great decor, plenty of seating inside and outside (as well as the \""porch\""? area).\n\nGood variety of coffees and teas, and even some beer and food. Free wi-fi, but not on the weekends."
3,"Now I can see why I was told to stay at the Westin...but heck, I didn't want to walk far to work.  \n\nFirst, when I first got the room, I kept hearing and noise, but didn't think anything of it.  Dropped off my stuff and headed to the office.  When I got back, the noise was still going...found out it was the toilet that wouldn't stop running.  OK, went downstairs to ask someone to fix it...then headed out to grab some food.  1-1.5 hrs later, came back and wasn't fixed.  Got ready to head to the YMCA and went back downstairs to remind them.  45 mins later, it was fixed.  Cool, right?  Not quite yet.  Found out that the toilet was leaking water...pool of water behind the toilet.  Called and had them come fix it.  Glad the guy was close by...didn't take long.\n\nOne pro is that most check-ins are around 3pm.  I actually switched from the Hilton Garden to this Hilton super early one morning.  They let me check in at 8am.  =)"
3,First time here! Food was ok! They were fresh but not so many choices 4 lunch. Good breakfast section & salad bar! No fish only fried fish & chicken. I was kinda of disappointed when I figured out no salmon!!!!!!!! Not a good dessert either! Definitely i am not gonna spend $65.00 there!!!! Customer service was good
3,"2.5 stars.\n\nStopped by tonight after having dinner at a pizzeria nearby.  Never been, but had prepared myself to expect a smaller location compared to that at Ray Rd. and the 101 (my fave!).  Was surprised to notice an unpleasant smell (akin to what Asian supermarkets tend to smell like with their stocks of rice and the odors that emanate from their meat shops) just as I entered the market, which continued as I entered the produce department.  \n\nThis place is small!  The \""olive bar\"" consisted of maybe 8 (max) containers the size of small bread loaves.  Pathetic, but what can you expect from a converted Wild Oats?  The selection of meats looked fresh, though (beef top loin is on sale at $5.99/lb., while center-cut pork chops are $2.99/lb!).  While the cheese counter is small, it did showcase fresh-looking items, and the whole store, in general, looked clean and was brightly-lit.  I couldn't find my favorite Wellshire bacon (peppered uncured), but I was able to find the only tasty whole-grain whole wheat bread I can enjoy w/o pain (Natural Bread Co.'s Honey Whole Wheat), albeit there was only one loaf available to buy!  And I quickly had a glimpse of their bulk section... Thank God I was full, or I'd have stopped for some sweets!\n\nIn a pinch, I'd stop here for emergency re-stocking, but I'll probably head over to the Tatum/Shea or Mayo locations (both of which I haven't visited, yet!) to get my dining-at-Whole Foods fix!"
3,"Meh.\n\nThese are nice but not spectacular, however they are reasoning and I stayed in an older room.\n\nThe staff here is not that friendly. when I checked in the girl said as little as possible to me and also told me the wrong floor. I was staying for a while so I was lugging luggage (lol) all around the building but couldn't find my room. I finally called the front and my room was on a completely different floor.\n\nAs mentioned, there is construction going on so there were a lot of workers and work trucks. I sat in my car for 12 minutes as one of the contractors was trying to back a trailer in. Um no, I'm a paying guest. You work around me.\n\nHonestly, I wouldn't stay here again. \n\nHowever, the actual hotel of this property is super nice and the staff is FANTASTIC."
3,"I haven't been to the original cronut bakery, the long lines are too intimidating. But thanks to La Cornetteria, I've got a taste of the famous croissant/donut. :)"
3,"So after that tragedy of a burger I had earlier from Carl's Jr., I felt a redemption could be made if I just ordered two cheeseburgers at BK.  How hard can it be to make two plain cheeseburgers?  So I waited, and waited, and waited, while other people were getting their chicken nuggets, Whopper Jr's, and Extra Long BBQ Cheeseburgers.  While all that was happening I was staring at their order board and saw my order was in red letters and was passing 5 minutes while all the others were in green letters and most were finished in under a minute.  For two plain cheeseburgers?  C'mon, now!!  Well I finally got my cheeseburgers and they definitely made up for that hot mess I had earlier from Carl's Jr."
3,Out of the gate i called for a reservation. they said no need.. just come on in. So i was upset to find a 30 min wait for a table. they told me they dont take reservations. it vegas... sat night... you guys should take reservations. just my opinion.\n\nmenu is small... food is over the top. \n\ntruffle fries were incredible.. everything else was good.. not great.. but good. i had good company which made the meal fun. so all in all we had a good time there. Its a pretty good place. i guess i would return under the right circumstances... but wouldnt run back there on my own...
3,"Good brunch and the atmosphere on the patio was very nice, but a pretty significant (I won't call fatal) flaw that merits no more than an A-OK.  If you cannot remove an ingredient from a dish on request you either do or do not, there is no try.  We asked for no onions, answer was yes, but when the dish came it had onions in it.  When we pointed it out we were told the cook tried to remove them but couldn't from the pre-made mix.  Appreciate the flexibility in trying to accommodate, but what if instead of a food we preferred to avoid it was in fact an allergy and you knowingly passed it onto us? Why not just tell us it's a mix and you can't really separate it from the meal ... instead of just serving it up anyway? The general lack of interest shown by the waiter on this left us with a bad feeling.  Despite their efforts and a few bright spots, there were some breakdowns in customer service (not just the one mentioned) and staff training, which add up to a lack of compelling reason to return.  So we probably won't."
3,"Not having had any Asian Buffet for a long two days, I whipped in here for lunch today.  Welcome to the place Yelp calls \""E-Z Buffet\"", but the owners call, alternatively, \""EZ Buffet\"", \""EZ Chinese Buffet\"", & \""Easy Buffet\"" depending upon which sign or printed matter of theirs you are viewing!  In any event, here goes:\n\nThis medium-large place was offering up 75 main food items today, featuring such strictly Chinese dishes as Clam Chowder, beef roast, Stuffed Bell Peppers, Calzone, pizza, & pink marshmallows!  Who knew???     :-)\n\nOk, this somewhat stylish, comfortable place with a friendly staff was also serving many of the usual Chinese treats including Sushi (Whoops, that's Japanese!), Kim Chee (Whoops, that's Korean!), Egg Foo Young (there!  ... & made the real way), & lots of what we usually see including fried chicken, boneless spare ribs, stuffed mushrooms, more chicken fixed all different ways, fish, shrimp, & so on, ending up with a good selection of desserts including tasty, REAL ice cream.\n\nIt's a high 3 Stars for this nice restaurant where the Lunch Buffet is $6.75/$6.08 Sr. on Monday through Saturday, $8.75/$7.88 Sunday, & they also offer a regular menu.     :-)"
3,"Chase Field is the home to the Arizona Diamondbacks (or Dbacks, I should say).  It's a rather nice field, with a good amount of seats and multiple levels.  \n\nLocated in the heart of Phoenix, this stadium became famous when it was first built.  Having a moving roof to let the sun in (or keep the rain out) was something unheard of at the time.  It is still a thing of wonders.\n\nI've only been to a few games here, but each time that I have come, I find that the experience is good.  It usually does not completely fill up (it's pretty easy to find seats together if you are going in a group), and it makes for a great family getaway.\n\nI would not exactly suggest that you plan on eating a full meal here... Prices are expensive, and the quality of food is not that good.  I would recommend that you eat outside of the stadium, and save room for a few drinks when you get inside.\n\nIf you have lived here for 10 years, or if you are just passing through, make sure to stop on by and see the magnificent edifice for itself."
3,"The sushi here is always very creative and yummy, and the decor makes for a nice environment to bring anyone to--even a casual date. Im giving them 3 stars because recently I've had pretty bad service. It appears the servers don't work sections or even tables. I had a group of 6 and we had four or five different people putting in orders and checking on us throughout the night. This worked out at first, but then of course we started getting ignored. I guess each server thought the other was checking on them, but it wasn't happening. We waited almost 45 minutes before flagging someone down to keep ordering sushi and to get a roll we head ordered what seemed like ages ago. Everyone was super friendly it's just inefficient. After all this flagging down we had to do, they of course tacked on a 20% gratuity and told us we could only split the check 3 ways, causing us to have to work out with each other who will be paying for who. All of this is making me less likely to return."
3,"If I'd never been to wicked spoon, I would have thought this was fantastic. The quality was good/ok, but it was crowded, and expensive for what you get unless you are just planning to Hoover mass quantities.\n\nIt was a little Disneyland-buffet ish."
3,"We have been to this place several times now. Each time the service has either been awesome (5 stars) or below mediocre (1 star), but the food is good! So average of 3 stars. If the food goes down hill, then this place will be a no go for us for sure."
3,"I almost feel bad giving this three stars, but we went today earlier in the day with my 7 year old and three adults.... 7 year old played in the fort thing and found a friend, had a great time. We walked down to the Fremont street experience and decided to have dinner there in the park. We walked back and ordered our meal (at about $20 a plate for tacos and beer!!!!) around 8:48 and my daughter asked if she could go out and see the mantis on fire... I told her yes! Then my husband went to get her and they told her she couldn't come back in!!!!!  She walked back in anyway. At 9:00 they announced that if you are under 21 the park is closing.  Mind you we were still waiting of our meal! This was Saturday night. So we then felt like we had to rush through our  meal we had JUST purchased in order to leave with the under age one. Not so great. If they are marketing this for families, then it needs to be that- 9pm is not that late for families on a weekend. If they aren't, then market it that way but they do need to decide what it is. I didn't appreciate having to rush through my meal."
3,"I've been here for dinner once and twice for brunch. Out of the three times, I would still give it a three star. I honestly don't think the food is that great here even when I come HUNGRY. But I have to admit, they have the presentation on lock-down."
3,"Came here with my Groupon over Labor Day weekend and had a really nice time! \n\nThe grounds are really nice, but the rooms themselves need a little updating. The tile in the bathroom and shower curtain both need to be replaced. In the cabinet under the TV, there looks like a space where a fridge used to be where there were just scratches and banged up empty cabinet. The TVs both worked only intermittently. \n\nI didn't really interact much with the staff except for check in and out, and they were fine during those encounters.\n\nThere are many activities to do here. Upper and lower pools, movies by the pool, smores, music, mini golf, playground for kids. You can rent paddleboards and kayaks to paddle around Lake Las Vegas if you want ($30/hr). I did see some people with dogs so I imagine they are dog friendly as well. Perhaps my furry friend will come along next time. \n\nOverall, I think the price I paid for the groupon was appropriate for the quality of the hotel, but I think that if I had paid full price I probably would have felt like I overpaid."
3,"My family came in town during restraunt week and Mez had the most diverse menu options out of the 4 restraunts we called. The atmosphere is upbeat, sexy and loungy. We had cocktails at the bar while waiting for our table and truly enjoyed the creative selection of cocktails! \nWe were seated for dinner at a great table with a sweet spunky server. The restrant week menu selection was GREAT! The crab cakes are probably the best I've had in Charlotte so far and the steaks were cooked perfectly. The only thing that left me wanting more was the dessert...could have been better but still a tasty treat. \n\nI would definitely go back...especially for happ hour with the girls!"
3,"Yelp 100 Challenge 2013- 13/100\n\nRed Ridge Park is literally a 10 min stroll from my condo. I will be moving soon and I will miss my frequent visits to this park. When in my hardcore fitness kick, I would run around the park and gauge my distance since 1 lap around the exterior of the park is close to a mile. As other mentioned, two sides are slightly up hill and the other two sides are flat= nice easy run. I also enjoy that it is well lit at night and I always felt safe running by myself. \n\nThe park features a small water park for kids, large play area for older kids,  smaller play area for younger kids (see pics), basketball courts, and a baseball diamond (see pic). The park is always busy, but I never really felt crowded. You will always see people walking, playing with their dogs,or enjoying a sunny day with a picnic. \n\nThey just started to build houses directly across from this park. The Dunhill homes start at around 200K for the base price and the neighborhood is growing. They're worth taking a look at if you like the Southwest area. Views of the park would be nice compared to views of other homes. The new Wet n Wild Water Park is close by, too. \nThe one thing I wish they had..... an enclosed dog park like some other parks I travel to visit."
3,"3.5 stars. Fan of the appetizers: the salumi and the grilled asparagus. We had for entree the fish and chips and although the batter was quite good the fish didn't have a lot of flavor, we had to add a bit of lime to improve it.\nOther people in the group liked their entrees except for one beef entree that was too salty. \nThe berries for dessert were outstanding. The ice cream was ok, the problem is they serve it in bowls that melt it really quick. The caramel dessert was again too salty."
3,"The Food was okay.  It's a bar.  It's better if you are a beer drinker.  I am not a beer drinker.   I had a black bean burger,  it was most likely a morningstar farms one.   Does that constitute a 1.99 additional charge?  I'm not sure.  \n\nThe service was spotty, but at least we got a refill on the drinks when our check got dropped off."
3,"Based on the reviews I was disappointed with my entre...chicken pasta (linguini, basil and cream sauce). Too heavy and thick with an excess of heavy cream. Service however was 5 star so I'd give it another try. Might just have been an off night. Glad they had one of my favorite brews...Dos Equis amber!"
3,"I've been to Osteria twice now. Once to grab a sandwich for lunch, and then to get a takeout pizza for dinner. I've really hoped this place would be good as I live across the street. My experience has been mixed. Sandwich was a very good Italian deli sandwich. Pizza was mediocre though. While the pizza had the unintended positive effect of reminding me of free pizza consumed when I was in grad school in NYC that's not the best sign of quality. Not bad but could be better. \n\nThere's a lot of potential for Osteria and I hope they succeed. Maybe a weekend brunch would be a good addition? And make pizza less like basic takeout pizza and more \""fancy\"" (tasty too)."
3,"I don't know that I have ever felt dirtier.\n\nStill, I had a blast the couple of times we floated the river. \n\nWe did the tie-everyone-together-plus-a- beer-cooler thing and enjoyed being wet and dirty. \n\nWear a big hat."
3,"It's fine.  No, really, it's fine.\n\nSeriously, it's fine.\n\nI'm not being sarcastic, it's fine.\n\n__________________________________\n\n(this is just for the breakfast buffet, which I've had 10-15 times since I usually stay here when I come to Pittsburgh)"
3,"You know going in that the food isn't going to be incredible, but you'd at least expect the staff to be friendly. This particular OG is very hit or miss. I've had both good and horrible dining experiences due to the waiter/waitress."
3,The food is good.  It's a nice breakfast spot and I'll probably end up eating here a lot.  The savory crepes are better than the sweet (in my opinion) and the coffee drinks are tasty.  \n\nThere are a few things I'd like to see change though:  \n\n- A hostess would be welcome.  Being my first time here I walked in and was unsure of what to do.  There's a register and a long counter so there was no clear indicator as to whether it was counter service or table service.  I had to track down an employee to find out.  \n- The service is spotty.  There were two waitresses working when I was there.  Every table was full so it was 15 minutes before we got to order.  \n- The wait times for food.  After ordering it was 20-25 minutes for two crepes.  That's way too much.  I didn't mind as I wasn't in a hurry but it made me sure to never come here if you have anywhere to be in the next 90 minutes.  \n\nI like crepes and  I like coffee and I like good service.  Two out of three ain't bad.
3,"Great value in vegas, $109 per night on a weekend compared to $400 for a cramped little room on the strip.  Throw in the free breakfast and free drinks in the evening and you have yourself a great value.\n\nThe hotel has been upgraded.  The rooms are nice enough.  The lobby atrium is a bit dated and the faux plants are a bit dusty.\n\nThere were some service issues.  We ordered food to go at the restaurant.  The place was empty and we were quoted 20 minutes to get our food.  In the end, it took 40.\n\nCheck in took forever, as did many interactions with the front desk.  The guys working the desk had to always stop and answer phones which was annoying.  But the one guy working the desk called me \""cute.\""  Not sure if I should be flattered or horrified.\n\nThere was never a consistent answer on the shuttle to the strip.  We were told they would take us anywhere (and they did) and pick us up.  But when I called for pickup, they said they only pick up and drop off at Planet Hollywood.  In the end, we had to use taxis a lot which ran $10 a trip to the strip.\n\nAll things considered, I like the other Embassy Suites on Paradise just a touch better and I have stayed there many times.  But they were $50 a night more when I booked so we stayed here."
3,"working in the gyle industrial estate this shopping centre is the closest thing for a lunchtime escape from the office.  so maybe i see it through rose-tinted shades while others may find this place a bit run down and lacking.  but for me, it's a beacon of clothing shops, food options, and starbucks that i can visit during my lunch break and enjoy a bit of freedom from the office.\n\ni'm pretty sure when the gyle was first opened it was shiny and state of the art, but i do feel that might have been awhile ago.  however what's on offer is still quite good, one of the largest marks & spencers food halls, a good sized morrisons, a huge boots, a decent new look and dorothy perkins, and my beloved starbucks.  they also have a millie's cookie stand which Kelly F can confirm i have a serious love affair with.  omg cookie cake anyone????\n\nyes it is a bit dark and the food court has a lack of options if you're looking for healthier food, but it's still a decent place to spend a lunch hour or make an emergency run to boots for when you're run out of mascara or concealor.  or when i've decided i just desperately need that new dorothy perkins dress i saw in my gossip magazine.  i like this place, it's a-ok and despite being slighty aged still has a fair bit to offer."
3,"Ever since this was built a number of years ago, I've been wanting to check it out but whenever I'm in Vegas, I usually hang along the strip most of the time and never made it out here.  My last trip I finally did.  \n\nThe things I do like about the \""experience\"" is that it's an outdoor party and I have to say the screens are pretty impressive.  \n\nThis is \""Old\"" Las Vegas where everything is dirt cheap.  All the drinks and food are inline with the prices I want to pay when I come to Vegas.  \n\nBut.......   \nIt's pretty damn ghetto here.  At least the night I came.  There were a lot of street people.  You could see some paperbags with some \""8 Ball\"" protruding from them.  But I guess that's part of the charm here cause you can just have an open container here with no damn worries....  \n\nIt's all good I guess but whenever I looked up at the screen, I had to make sure I looked back to street level here and there just to make sure my wallet was not leaving me.  haha..  \n\nMaybe the earlier shows are not so seedy.  I did come for the very last show of the evening so maybe I was asking for it...."
3,"My wife and I stopped here after seeing Zumanity the night before Halloween. Fortunately there were a ton of people out and about in their costumes. We wanted to find a place where we could have a drink and watch people. This place fit the bill perfectly. \n\nFortunately for us we had a couple free drink coupons, so we didn't have to pay. However, the prices aren't too bad for a great selection of craft and microbrews ($6-7). I had a Sin City Amber and the wife had a Sam Adams Cherry Wheat. They had a lot of good beer here from places like Sierra Nevada, Alaska, Abita, Rogue, Stone, etc. This place has a better selection than a lot of other bars in Vegas. \n\nBeing a Friday night NYNY was pretty hopping, but this place wasn't overwhelmingly full, though you would have thought so watching the bartenders running around, that was really my only issue with this place. Even with the free drink coupons, I tip well, so I was hoping for a bit better service. I will chalk it up to a bad night, and will go again, especially as a place to meet friends staying on the Strip.\n\nFun place, and we will be back."
3,"One of the better Italian restaurants in the city, and one of the nicest restaurants in Oakland, Lucca would be a fantastic choice at a lower price point.  The food is well prepared; the staff is usually friendly and helpful; and the ambiance is nice without being stuffy.  But the pricing for this experience is more appropriate for a city like New York or San Francisco."
3,"I guess I expected more.  Great view.  I watched Vegas from the day time to night, which was nice.  The food and decor was average, it could be better. The only thing about this restaurant that makes it so special is it's view, but I live here."
3,"I have watched Viva Elvis a few times, from grand opening to a few months ago.\n\nThe show has improved since it first open but it hasn't progressed too much.  Don't get me wrong the show isn't bad, it just doesn't seem to fit well with Cirque's other show.  \n\nWhat i liked about the show was the awesome music, scenes, and costumes.  As soon as you walk in you are greeted by some of the performers that are dressed up in elvis era.  My favorite number was jail house rock and return to sender.  \n\nWhat I didn't like was the choreography wasn't as thrilling as other cirque shows. It seemed very minimal and not much to the \""awe\"" factor.  I really didn't like that in a few scenes they have women sing elvis songs.. i just rather it be.. idk.. ELVIS singing his songs.  They are not bad singers, however the singers would change it to their style and it just didn't seem right.  I also didn't like the awkward transition of each scene.  \nBUT besides that.. i did enjoy it.  \n\nI would recommend to go watch it, especially since it will be leaving soon."
3,"Unfortunately this business is under new ownership and I have not been as impressed with the quality of my eyebrow waxing. The new owner left one of my brows uneven and thinner than the other, leaving me to have to grow out my brows longer than usual between waxings. I will most likely not be returning."
3,"Second time i have been to a culinary dropout, first time at this one.\n\nAs always love the atmosphere, especially because the Yard was right there as well.\n\nHappy Hour beware are only at the bar, hightops, or outside. We didn't go for that so it wasn't too big of a deal, but could have been.\n\nOnly had the hip bar type food when we were here for a work hang out. It was good from what I had. \n\nDefinitely a fun place to come to hang out and just kick it with friends. Consider it an adult playground."
3,"The seared tuna carpaccio, ninja roll and elephant roll were pretty delicious.  The vibe is trendy, however a tad bit cramped.  Not a fan of the low rise sushi bar counter, but that's just my preference.  Not a bad price for AYCE dinner.  There's plenty of parking.  The music is nice and I like how ventilated the establishment is.  The food was good enough and overall the experience was positive."
3,"I got my first two tattoos here, with Jessy.\n\nMy sister went to Jessy for some custom work, and really liked her.  \nWhen it came time for my first one, my sister and I got matching dragonflies on our hips.  \n\nJessy was fast, friendly, and made me feel comfortable.  \nIn fact, I liked her work so much, I went back 2 weeks later for another dragonfly on my other hip.  Jessy inverted the colors so it matched the first one, but with just one tiny difference.\n\nThe shop was clean, which is very important to me.  \n\nExcellent first experience for me."
3,"Go to Bang if:\nYou enjoy Billy Joel, Elton John, top 40 done via piano, people watching, standing if you can't get a table (and you probably won't unless you show up at 7pm), singing loudly to Journey while the drunk girl screeches next you, sweating.\n\nDon't go to Bang if: \nYou hate all of the above, have issues with bachelorette or birthday parties, fear being dragged onstage to sing or dance while people judge you, you like your piano straight up - none of this guitar/drum nonsense at a dueling piano bar. If you have a headache or a stick up your ass, this place will not help. \n\nCover at the door. Overall, fun place to visit but I wouldn't want to live here."
3,"Good place to watch a game, the bartenders were fairly attentive but food service time was poor. After 30+ minutes waiting for an app, I canceled the order and asked for my check."
3,I was expecting great things from this sandwich shop but was disappointed to find basically a glorified lunch counter. The ingredients just didn't seem to be very high quality. The steak melt didn't have enough steak in it. The sandos sound good but the execution didn't seem to be there. For the inflated price tag I want a great sandwich. This wasn't.
3,"I was more impressed with Squirrel Hill itself than I was with Bangkok Balcony. My friend and I found this place on a \""vegan's guide to Pittsburgh\"" type Web site, and they were open late, so that worked for us. We found street parking very easily. I was disappointed that most of the clothing stores were closed, because there was such a great mix of vintage and new fashions. \n\nI digress. I really liked the layout of BB... how it's on the top floor and everything is modern without being sterile. We both really liked the flatware they use here, and that's something we almost never comment on. They had a good selection of tofu items and I loved how they asked me to tell them how spicy I wanted my food \""on a scale from one to ten.\"" The food here is also more inexpensive than I would have thought, seeing how packed the place was and how nicely decorated. \n\nOverall, it was good, but I'm biased -- I love Thai food so much that I could eat it all the time. The reason I'm only giving this place three stars is because we both felt a little sick later on in the evening."
3,"They gave us a great table right next to the floor to ceiling windows. overlooking the strip. the HUGE Jumbo screen and parking lot that were in view aren't very romantic but the Eiffel tower in the distance was. \n\nDrinks - great cocktails\n\nMy only comment is the live music is on the other side of the bar from the windows. so you have to choose -  view or live music.. not both. :P kind of sleepy. everyone here was paired up. good for the \""mature\"" or \""date\"" crowd. I wanted to meet people and laugh so we had one drink and left. still worth checking out."
3,I had the frozen hot chocolate to go. The wait was long but the hot chocolate was good enough that I would have it again. Don't really think it's worth the $9 they charge for a small but what are you going to do!\n\nI'm glad I finally got to try it after seeing it on one of Oprah's favorite things. Next time I'll have to try their food.
3,"Breakfast: eggs, potatoes, bacon, coffee and juice...you know, breakfast. $22.00. $10 entree, $3 coffee, $6, 10 oz OJ, (say what?) $3 tip plate-sized side of hash browns. It was good, but not that good. I'll stick with Waffle House: twice the food for half as much, and just as good. Better coffee in fact.  Final judgment, good but not great, 25% overpriced."
3,"It was OKay but I don't see what all the hype is about.  I'm from Maryland and made Price's one of my \""must go\"" spots when I visited Charlotte in May 2012.  The wings are SOOOO small...OMG!!  They were just ok to me, the best part of the experience was getting tater tots instead of fries.  (Reminds me of my high school days..ahhhh)  \n\nAnyway, I can get the same pressure fried cooked wings from any of the Armish Markets here in Maryland and the wings are much more satifying.  \n\nPrice's is now off of my list of places I MUST visit."
3,"The food is alright, Only place I could find around for a quick bit to eat. I stayed at the Mandala Bay which is next to this place."
3,"When I saw that a Korean BBQ place had moved in to the empty Mcdonalds store front, I was pretty excited! I would finally be able to try Korean food at a good price..Which was partially correct. They are pricey for 'fast-food', with most of their options, including a la carte, being around $7-9. I have tried their Bulgogi, with steamed vegetables and kimchi, which was all really good! The sweetness of this dish was great with the garlic and spice of the kimchi! \n\nI really want to try their Mandu and tempura, but they keep it under heat lamps in the front, which makes me wonder how long it has been there..but will probably try it one day ( I was watching ABC 15 and saw they got a D for their health inspection in July. It was for things like improper holding temperatures, kimchi made at home(was removed from service), thermometers, ect. BUT Most of these problems were solved on the same day)\n\nI see now that they have added Boba tea, which I'm also really excited for, seeing as how it's hard to find without driving to the far west or Scottsdale to find!\n\nHopefully the busier they get, the lower prices will become, but being one of the only Korean places on the East side of Phoenix, they might not."
3,"Not too bad. I am not at all the Old Town Scottsdale nightlife kind of gal anymore, so this wouldn't be my scene during those times. However, about 12 of my girlfriends and I went to The Mint for Happy Hour on a Friday and had a pleasant time. The food is really good! The drinks are good and the 1/2 price makes them very reasonable. The interior was pretty cool. Later at night you probably wouldn't be able to notice all the cool details. The co-ed bathroom is weird - just weird. I really didn't like that. The staff while very attractive and friendly, seemed a bit new. Our very sweet server had a lot of trouble with our big group. She didn't want to do separate checks at the beginning and told us doing one group bill would be easier for everyone. Then, when we tried to pay, it was a problem and someone else told us we should have done separate checks...we tried! I waited 30 minutes for my bill when there might have been 3 other patrons in the Mint other than our group. I would definitely come back for another happy hour and check out the outdoor bar, but would probably insist on separate checks."
3,"This is a cool spot.  Lots of art work and giant tvs occupy the main bar.  Upstairs they have pool tables, aracde and skee-ball machines.  There is an outdoor patio too (the smokers love it!)  Noda folks love to gather here Sundays to watch the game.  \n\nThey don't have any food I think but we noticed Sunday while we were here that they had a chicken wing buffet?  Looked like it was free - folks were just helping themselves.\n\nThe offer local beer - love it!  And there is street parking and parking behind the building.  Another great stop on a Noda beer crawl!"
3,"I have to say I was not as impressed as other people on Yelp giving it 4 and 5 star reviews. I will say that it was good but by far not the best burger I've ever had. Also, to pay $60 for a burger, fish sandwich, fries and 2 sodas I felt I should have left amazed. Definitely didn't meet my expectations and my beautiful girlfriend agrees with me. I will say 3 stars....It was ok / good but not amazing."
3,"Dissapointingly different from how the original Canyon Ranch is represented in books and other reviews.  Over-priced, smaller than the spa @ The Venetian and offers nothing novel besides the expensive energy massage \""without physical touch\"".  Huh??  \nThis isn't my first choice."
3,"Husband and I went for HH and also ordered some regular menu items. The drinks were a decent price (hh prices). We ordered the Gladiator burger & daily dose burger which were both just okay. They were both lacking flavor and the msuhroom brie was mediocre. Despite the fact it was dead, we felt very rushed. Hope was training another waitress - I hope the trainee doesn't listen to her. Besides rushing her patrons, she talked down to her own trainee. When she introduced her trainee, she literally said, \""Don't ask her questions because she's new and won't know.\"" WOW. I've been a waitress before and I would have been furious if I was talked to like that during my training, and as a patron - it looks horrible that you are degrading your own coworker."
3,"All apple stores for the most part are spacious....well lit....products well displayed....and friendly professional service.. this one is no different. Now with all that being said the prices are horrible for what they are....so please for all you apple lover's realize you can do better with your money. A matter of fact I am taking donations...if you just have money to waste or give away....Thanks. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!"
3,"The food was good with a decent selection, not amazing. The atmosphere isn't anything special. It's not lively, especially for Vegas. Went with a groupon, so it was a good price. Otherwise it is overpriced"
3,"Did a detail there, they did a good, but not oustanding job, but for a reasonable price (like $150).  Tons better than Danny's would ever do!\n\nI've had other, better, details in the area, but they were closer to $250... so comparing the quality of the work versus the price, Airpark was a good/very good value."
3,"This Panda Express has a drive-thru, which is great when it's 103 outside and I want lunch without stepping out into the broiler.   It was a fast queue and they got my order right.   \n\nThe orange chicken/Beijing beef was pretty unpalatable though, it was really dried out and sauceless.  It's a Panda Express, that happens.  Basically your average Panda without getting out of the car."
3,"Although I go here a  lot when I'm in Vegas be advised if you're white some dishes will be heavily 'sanitized' to suit  your perceived taste without asking.  For example,  on a recent visit I ordered the super combination pho (the one usually at the top of the list at any pho place) and it came without any tendon or tripe...and they didn't throw in more of the 'regular' meats to compensate."
3,"While I am absolutely in love with the Galaxy Luxury theater, sometimes, I can't drive across town for a movie, or they don't have enough seating for the one I want.\n\nBrenden is a comfy theater, and I've always had good experiences here.  The employees are polite, and prices are standard."
3,Oh no's!\n\nMamma Mia has revised their delivery boundary. I live 0.7 mile away. \nNo longer close enough to be considered for delivery.\n(according to their online system)\n\nIf you're:\nEast of 20th St\nWest of 64th St\nNorth of Washington\nor\nSouth of Lincoln\n\nJust drive!\n\nPretty good pizza. \nOffered by the slice!
3,This review is for the Mexican Restaurant.  It's pretty good.  The salsa bar is great.  Big portions.  I would give it 4 stars but the decor is old
3,"3.5 stars\n\nI'm a fan of Flamebroiler (do they have those in AZ?) so I'm trying to find a decent teriyaki bowl place close to me. I want to say rice bowls are for Asian/Indian people what sandwiches must be for White people lol; quick, cheap, tasty and a usually healthy meal. I think this place fits the bill! \n\nI got the cayman which is a combo of two of their items. I got the Fiji and Singapore curry. Fiji is like slow cooked chuck roast in teriyaki sauce, good but still a little tough. Singapore curry had chicken and carrots in like a Japanese curry (like the cubes you buy at the asian market) but with a hint of sourness. The meat (chicken) was stringy because it was also slow cooked, a texture I didn't care for.\n\nOverall I enjoyed my meal and serving size was good, I couldn't finish my bowl.Price was cheap, 5 bucks! Even less if you get one item. I appreciate their unique menu, away from the typical chicken or beef drenched in teriyaki sauce, but its nothing mind blowing. Probably will be back since its so close to Midwestern, and so cheap! I'll update this review after I try some more items. Looking forward to trying their appetizer items, crab puffs and egg rolls.\n\n10% discount for Midwestern students!"
3,"They had a pre opening party for Trader Vic's at Planet Hollywood last week .\nTikipug had this to say about the party.\nWe ate like Kings. Lobster, shrimp, duck. It was awesome. They took us up to a banquet room in the hotel. They had hula dancers, mai tais, and free mugs. We got to meet Eve, Trader Vic's granddaughter and tour the unfinished restaurant.\nExecutive chef Rick Giffen, previously at Mon Ami Gabi at Paris next door did the cooking. That's not your average Pu Pu platter.\n\nThe three stars so far is based on their  the food and drinks. The decor one star. Maybe they should offer VR (visual reality ) helmets\n I love Trader Vic's where ever they may be including the Polynesio in Havanna (thats another story) but this is a Trader Vic's Lounge like the new one in Beverly Hill's.\n."
3,"Great hotel room but can be really overpriced depending on when you go. I came here over Memorial Day weekend with a few people. I loved the hotel room but they charge for everything! For a roll-away bed was an extra $20 per night, you couldn't even use the mini-fridge without being charged. \n\nThere are some perks that included it was in a central location, minutes from the strip. They host Rehab, which is a concert. When I came Drake and Lil Wayne was there but guests still have to wait in line to get their complimentary tickets that are for only 2 guests. And make sure you get in line early because prices double, they will stop selling tickets, and the line will be close to 2 hours and up to get a ticket. Then the casino, restaurants, and night club in the hotel so you don't have to leave the hotel at all to have a good time! \n\nAfter all of that  I'll still try another hotel next time I'm in Vegas or try on a less crowded weekend."
3,"We started with Waffle Fry Nachos these feature waffle fries doused in gooey white cheddar and sloppy joe, and then it's topped with salsa and jalapenos. It was delicious, however, next time I'd likely ask the kitchen to hold the sloppy joe. I wouldn't miss the meat.\n\nI had the Crispy Four Cheese Burger. The cheese is fried crisp onto the patty producing a cheesy concoction that is crisp and creamy. Aside from the brioche bun, I thought it was tasty and well seasoned. I found the bun to be too much bread for the burger making it too dry. The onion roll would've been a better choice. That's what my husband selected for his BYOB, beef patty with pepper jack cheese, jalapenos and caramelized onions all situated on the onion roll. It was well prepared, flavorful and juicy.\n\nService was pretty slow, but the place had only been open a week on our visit. Most places need a little time to get the kinks worked out. I'd hope service improves with time."
3,"A-OK describes Steve's Greenhouse Grill perfectly in my opinion. It's somewhat like a Cracker Barrel minus the company backing and plus sports... a rather kitsch design scheme with loud colors, loud TVs, and loud alcohol advertisements hung all around, a large and  eclectic menu with something that will surely please all types of eaters, your very typical bar menu of slightly overpriced drinks, and somewhat over the top servers singing praise over every single menu item (\""You can't go wrong!\"" \""They're all my favorite!\""). I had some chicken fried steak with fries and Kristen G. had \""The Special\"", which was fish and chips with a bowl of New England clam chowder. Everything was A-OK. Some things were a little salty, some things were just right, some too bland... I'm telling you, if you took a Cracker Barrel, cut the budget by three quarters, and told the manager to attempt to please every kind of patron that would be walking around this area of Phoenix, you would get Steve's Greenhouse Grill."
3,"Like others in the area, we waited and watched as this space developed into Central Bistro.  The atmosphere is delightful, albeit loud.  With the windows open (gotta love Phoenix this time of year!), it was glorious.  I do wonder what the sound level will be like once the windows are closed.\n\nFood is delicious.  Service good.  One Big Problem - on 2 visits we observed bartenders prepping garnish with bare hands.  I mean, peeling an orange with juice running down his hands and arms, then slicing it up to use in drinks.  Last visit we observed a bartender putting his hand down into the olive jar, grab a handful and put them in the garnish tray.  I immediately took the olives out of my martini!\n\nPlease - to the wonderful people at Central Bistro:  Get it together before Maricopa County comes to visit."
3,"I decided I would like all my dining to be done at the bar of old renovated homes in downtown Phoenix.  Lucky me, I found Coronado Cafe.\nWe stopped in for lunch so I did not order as much food as I normally like to when trying out a new restaurant ( it was a work day ).  Unfortunately, I will only be reviewing on item.  I'll make it up to you; I promise.\nWe went during lunch and there was a wait for a table for two, so we sat at the bar.  The place is pretty small.  The bar was big enough for four people, five tops.  There was a nice selection of spirits and wine that I could see but not drink.  I ordered the roasted chicken sandwich and chose the potato salad over the baked beans.  It was deliciously moist and the chiles had the right amount of heat.  The potato salad was very tasty satisfying side.\nIt was a simple, satisfying lunch.  I would like to come back another time when they aren't as busy.  It was hard to get a server/bartender's attention and there's some cozy seating outside that's too hot to use at lunch in August."
3,"I have to agree with both Pierre and Donald. However there are 2 menu items worth ordering. I get them togo all the time for lunch. The lettuce wedge and the willy burger. The steaks are awful! They put some crap they describe a seasoning that is so overpowering you can't eat it. Also someone needs to teach the cook the difference between Med rare and Well. I know I know that is a big difference but when I ordered the rib-eye med rare I got a hockey puck! Sidebar the bread is really good when you get it hot. \n\nThe wrap up burgers are good and the lettuce wedge rocks, skip the steaks!"
3,"Liked this place. Went on a Sunday so the guy didn't make much because he said their slow on Sundays. We tried a little bit of everything and liked it. I would have given more stars but the service was bad, maybe the guy was in a bad mood, not sure. Make sure you have somewhere to eat after you buy the poke unless you want to eat outside in the Vegas heat! No indoor seating. Would recommend you come here to pick up poke because overall the food was good."
3,"Decent food is served here at affordable prices.  We came during the middle of the week for breakfast after reading so many positive reviews.  Was looking forward to trying one of their pots of bread that we read so much about.\n\nWe came at a good time because we had no wait at all.  The restaurant was about half full.  Our server was terrific, friendly, attentive, and fast.  \n\nThere are many choices on the menu.  We were getting confused because everything sounded so good.  I finally decided on Jamm's French Toast.  My wife ordered an omelet.\n\nSo, what did I think of the food?  Overall, it was okay.  Maybe, we did not order the best food off the menu.  Would I come here again?  Probably not.  There are so many breakfast places yet for us to try in Las Vegas."
3,"SO much better now that they have changed the entrance. The girls line used to make you hike up 5 stories of industrial parking garage-esque stairs only to make you hike up another 2 floors to the main dance floor. Now, they just make you take a random guest elevator to a random floor where you have to navigate through a freaking pool-side concert and up another flight of stairs to the promised land. So yay. \n\nI still hate the tiny dance floor that they close off access to, and the inability to even see the dance floor when the place gets crowded. If you want any room to stand and breathe, you have to go outside, which is quite suboptimal in the winter. \n\nThus it is OBVIOUS that the same lunatics who designed TAO designed this place as well. No flow, no ambiance, no comfortable partying to be had. Back to XS it is!"
3,"Went out here with some friends on Sunday night, right when you walk in it is a little small, but they do have an outdoor section where it is heated. The menu is fairly large with lots of selections. We all ordered different things but the portions are large! So be careful many items on a small table can make it difficult to eat! BUT- I enjoyed the food, tea gets served in a metal dish container. The food is heavy on the saucy side. The service could have been better."
3,"Great pizza, HORRIBLE customer service. The black girl at the cash register did not acknowledge my presence when I came up and was very rude when she did. After I paid for my slice, I asked if I should just sit down and she just rolled her eyes at me. No answer, nothing. \n\nOne guy, kind of reddish hair actually greeted me when I walked in and the man making pizzas behind the window actually said thank you to me, but at one point I heard the red haired boy and the black girl get into it because she was yelling at him before he walked out for a delivery. Very unprofessional.\n\nNot to mention how dirty this place was. I couldn't find a table that wasn't filthy and when I ordered my pizza, it was from a pie that was just sitting out on a stool and thrown in the oven for a couple minutes. \n\nGood pizza, but please work on the customer service."
3,"stopped here for a quick dessert b/c my wife love red velvet cupakes.  we came after lunch on a sunday and the selection was extremely limited.  each cupcake runs $3.00 which isnt bad for a \""gourmet\"" cupcake shop.\n\nthe cupcakes are definitely loaded with frosting, however i wasnt overly impressed with the taste of caramel on my cupcake and the red velvet ones were not made with cream cheese frosting.\n\nall in all great for a nice dessert."
3,"Good place to dine while in the Phoenix airport. The service is friendly, the atmosphere is nice, and the food is good. I ordered the grilled chicken stuffed pita with lettuce, tomato, hummus, and a vinaigrette. There are plugins too. Can't beat that."
3,"Beautiful club, no doubt.\n\nI did go on a night where our industry trade show was in town, and my industry happens to be mainly composed of men.  So the guy girl ratio was probably OFF the charts for this club's normal operation, about 50 guys to 1 girl....... no joke!\n\nBesides the sausage-ness of my visit, it was still fun to hang out and grab a few drinks with friends, colleagues, and the occasional female model.  Even if the drinks are a bit watered and expensive....\n\nWould i return?\n\nYes..... if it's not under the \""you have to know someone to get in\"" stigma it operates under most of the time."
3,"I was looking for best Peking duck in town and found Blossom. According to our server, it takes 2 days to prepare. I had a very high expectation for this place since it is $79 per duck. Fyi: I had pecking duck from one of the best Peking duck restuarant in Beijing. The duck was served with skin and meat and sauce on a wrap. Ummm. It should be served with skin only? The skin is not crispy enough. The sauce is ok. After that the duck was brought back to chop. The meat was juicy but have a bit of distinct smell of the duck. Overall, the Peking duck is better than other places in So cal like duck house. But it is far from comparable to the Peking duck I had in Beijing.  And for the price, I would expect better quality."
3,"Always good. Pass on the pasta dish. Disappointing. \n\nAlso they make a Pizzookie that is supposed to be half cooked and it was not even 20% cooked. \n\nI mentioned it to our waiter (worst one we ever had there. Thomas I think) and he said \""it's supposed to be like that\"" then walked away! Awesome customer service.\n\nRating is down from a 4 or 5 due to service. Maybe it will be better if we go back again."
3,"Came here on a Thurs night and there was no wait for dinner. They had a fancy dinner menu with fish, poultry and meats, but we opted for their lighter fare summer dinner menu which had sandwiches, pastas and pizzas. We tried the chicken buffalo wing \""lollipops\"" as our appetizer, it was your run of the mill buffalo wings but prepared so that one end was the bone and the other end was the chicken which made it super easy to eat. I'm big on italian food so I was trying to decide between either the pizza or pasta and ended up choosing the \""pasta a la bolognaise\"" which was a huge mistake. It was penne-like pasta with tomato and meat sauce which looked like something I could have made and I'm not a cook. It wasn't horrible but I just wasn't expecting something so mediocre in taste and presentation. Portions were big though, I'll give them that. Service was good and the pizzas at the surrounding tables looked good so I would probably try that next time if I ever came back."
3,"I'm a vegetarian and light beer drinker and go to Alchemy only because a group of my friends do. Alchemy is to be commended for its expansion of vegetarian items, Now I know that I won't be forced to eat a portobello sandwich, which is very tasty at Alchemy, but what vegetarian wants always to have to eat this or a veggie burger because nothing else is available for us? The maize salad is great --the small salad makes a whole meal. But the latest menu has gone too far. Alchemy should not be trying to prepare Southeast Asian food. I'm a connoisseur of it so was tempted by their Vietnamese Rice Noodle Salad. Unfortunately, it was atrocious. Avoid at all costs."
3,"Not a bad place to hang out or swing by for dinner, but it's pretty pricey in terms of drinks and the food is meh. Sandwiches are always very salty and the meat doesn't seem so fresh. However, if you're here just for beer or UFC night, it is a pretty decent place to relax with friends. Karaoke night is fun too."
3,"This is growing to be your local hipster students' HQ. Yes, now tea is cool..or whatever expression kids use nowadays. And I guess the key to that success is that everything's colorful, and young, and YAY! versus your imagined usual dark, damp tea-drinking place. My opinion of this place changes every time I go. On my first visit, I had a couple of questions, and a suspiciously young employee promptly told me...to go online. Well, uh, thanks...I guess? \nThe second time went more smoothly, and the employees were keen on giving me the \""DavidsTea experience\"" (again, fresh, young, colorful and YAY!). Turns out, you can both buy tea for yourself at home, or to carry around. Teas for immediate consumption are labelled 2,50$. Expensive, but I figured I needed a pick-me-up. So I choose my tea, hot or iced? latt\u00e9, black, or with milk? with honey or agave? I picked a chocolate-orange mix, with whisked soy milk and agave...for 4,50$!!! Hold on! Was everything optional? Even more heart-breaking is that the tea-making lady throws whatever brew that doesn't fit your cup in a sink! \nWas it good? Yeah, epic! Epically expensive as well, if you ask me.\nThis shop is more for your quick cafeine fix, and gets cramped quickly. Might not want to buy your glass kettle there."
3,Ok!!!! Update with thrifty rental car service....  Had to call in for road side service some how a huge nail was attracted to my rear right tire... Road side service was there with in. 5 mins....  Called to exchange car today customer service with corporate office was Excellent.... Exchange of vehicle took less than 30 min... They even let me pick the vehicle.... Customer service improved a lot... \nFeels like they read my review....
3,"Stayed here on business earlier this year. Was just OK. It took FOREVER to check-in and seemed like their check-in procedure was pretty low tech (hence the slowness). They f-ed up a delivery I needed (which was late and they had issues finding where it went in house). I didn't try and of the restaurants on site but hit up one of the cafes (forget the name but it's the one that has all the yummy pastries). It was fine but got tired of the Frenchness after a couple days:)\n\nRoom itself was fine, maybe a bit better than your usual room. Overall though, the hotel left me feeling a bit blah and I wouldn't plan on staying here for a personal vacation."
3,"I popped in here looking to see if they had any antenna balls. They were out and were getting new ones in, but didn't know exactly when. They had a picture to show me what they looked like but that didn't really help me.\n\nI grabbed a Jumbo Jack while I was in. It was tasty and gave me my taste of JITB that I can't get in Canada."
3,"I wasn't blown away by this place. It's another \""trendy\"" restaurant in Scottsdale Quarter that has the feel of a Fox restaurant. \n\nThe menu is small and not very descriptive. The food is not anything out of the ordinary. I'd describe it as interesting but not delicious. I ordered the roasted chicken because my waitress said it would be \""half a chicken,\"" so I assumed that there would be breast meat. Nope. A measly thigh and drumstick. Baby spinach saturated in sodium. Runny polenta. \n\nEverything appeared very creative, but tasted less than impressive. What a disappointment. \n\nThere seemed to be confusion among the waitstaff; several appetizers were presented to our table that we did not order...I wonder how much this affects TK's profit margin...they certainly make up for it with the frugal portion size. \n\nIt's not a place that I'll seek out again."
3,"Decent Chinese take-out.  The Lo Mein is good, as are their shrimp and beef dishes.  Did not care for their shrimp and lobster sauce.  Their ribs can be hit or miss, depending on how fatty they are.  Also did not care for their Won ton or egg drop soup.  Their fried rice is good, but then, I've rarely had bad fried rice..."
3,"Just went to the original location in Fort Lauderdale a few weeks ago. That was awesome, and the food was amazing. This location, not so much. It just didn't wow me. It was still good, but just not the same. Even the ambiance was different. It was a busy Wednesday night in Florida. It was a quiet Monday night in Vegas. We were one of 5 tables that were occupied in the quiet place at 8p. But that's fine, I understand. \n\nThe meatball was drier than expected, the pasta was undercooked. The chicken parmesean was good, but it was just okay good. The sauce is still awesome. \n\nI find it interesting to see that almost all of the positive reviews of this place include a mention that Steve was there. Could that improve the quality? Possibly. I watched him inspect just about every dish that left the kitchen at the original location. That definitely didn't happen here. \n\nSo it's getting three stars. Our service was good, the food just didn't meet the expectations set by...his own restaurant. And thats what brings me back. I likely won't be back to this location. Too many other great options in Vegas. But I am still looking forward to my next visit to the Florida location!"
3,"Gave Chang's another chance this week, and this time the service was much better. Quite friendly and efficient, as a matter of fact. Shared the Salt and Pepper Prawns and Shrimp Fried Rice, and both were delicious. I've always liked their food. No, it's not the greatest or most original Asian food around, but it's pretty good. It's the service that I've struggled with - but if they're able to maintain the level they displayed the other day, I will definitely continue to grace their restaurant with my presence. Ha!\n\nOh, also told our waiter about my fortune-less fortune cookie on my last visit, and he apologized profusely, said they got a bad batch last month in which one out of every three cookies was empty. The problem had been resolved, he assured me, and sure enough this time I got a fortune. Not a very good one, something about me having a deep appreciation of the arts and music (Well, duh), but hey, it was a fortune. Sort of. Ok, not really. But it was a saying on a little piece of paper, which was all I really wanted.."
3,"The decor alone seals the deal for me. Mid Century modern, and the restaurant is done well. Favorite place to dine with one of my friends and catch up. Sitting in the booths makes it feel super private. The chopped salad is what I always get simply because I adore it. Green goddess dressing is incredible. They serve rolls and butter, and they are the real thing! A throwback for sure...super soft and warm! I might be addicted to iced tea (jury is still out) and I am delighted by how it is served here...big, tall glass, mint, a side of simple syrup for sweetening, and an iced tea spoon! It's the simple things sometimes that really add to my experience :) Not sure if they still serve this, but their cake & a shake for desert is to die for. Tiny chocolate shake served with tiny chocolate cake. Perfect little treat!"
3,Is a family restauran nothing exaiting the place is ok but she burn my Padd see u every time and i stop eating there
3,"The food is good here, but not up to the quality of the other top notch steakhouses in Scottsdale. The prices are the same as the other high quality restaurants, so I expect the same quality in return. It's just not quite the same. If the price wasn't the same then I would come back because it's still good. However, if I'm going to pay top dollar then I'd rather go to some of the other places that I know are going to be the best like City Hall.\n\nThey do a few things different, which is a nice change like their popover bread to start, and some of their main dishes. The steaks are good, but not excellent, and everything seems to get about the same grade. I will probably come here again for a change of pace and hope that it's just a little better, but definitely not in my top 3 for steakhouses in Scottsdale."
3,This place is cool and cheap but you are paying for what you get. I got this key chain for my mother. It was 12 dollars. It broke about a week later while she was holding it. I was actually there when it happened. So then I came back returned it for her and gave it another shot. Again about a week later it broke. I went back and finally just got a gift card because I paid cash and didnt have the reciept or else I would have just gotten a refund. This place is a hit or miss. Some of the stuff is good priced but some of it not so much. Since it is inside tivolli there is a  lot of parking options
3,"This Thai Rama is a small little place located near the light rail but in a spot that can be easy to miss. Being a huge fan of Thai food and a little picky, I was slightly worried when we approached it. However, one of my friends was craving Thai and I was thinking I could always get a little something :)  \n\nThe menu was very large and seemed to have a lot of good offerings. Not being very hungry, I was enthusiastic they had a dessert they called F.B.I. which was friend bananas and coconut ice cream. Myself and another guest ordered that and the other member of our party ordered shrimp pineapple curry (yum). The food came out fairly fast with the ice cream dishes coming out only a minute before the main course dish. \n\nThe ice cream was a little on the ice side (as if it had been overfrozen) but overall was a delicious meal. I tasted some of the shrimp pineapple curry and it was just the right temperature and full of flavor. However, the pineapple was obviously canned which make it lack that something.\n\nI'm not sure I'd go out of my way to come back here again, but with the pleasant staff, if I was in the area, I might swing on in."
3,It is the crew that makes this store work!\nAnd it is the crew that keeps me coming back!\nThey always seem to go above and beyond what is being asked.\nThat kind of service is rare!
3,"This is the closest Dairy Queen to me, so my brother and I frequent here a lot. We mainly go for the shakes and blizzards as well as the ice cream cakes when it's someone's birthday. The ones that we've tried are actually pretty delicious. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the people who work here are 90% crap whenever we come here. There are a lot of times where I've encountered rude staff, but it's not something that I can't tolerate. I go for the food anyway and not the service."
3,"Once upon a time, you could walk into Uncle Sal's on a Friday night with no reservations and be seated immediately. (Holy crap - has it really been 20 years since I lived in the area?!?!)\nThose days are long gone. Dinner was on me for coordinating - and I dropped the ball.\n\nLuckily, the Blind Pig was right next door, and we 4 hungry patrons could be seated and served right away.\n\nWe shared a couple plated for the table, and nibbled each other's entrees. The steak salad was a winner. The short rib was well cooked and flavorful. And everything else was perfectly OK. I had a trio of tacos  - none of which really stood out. Nothing wrong with them. Fresh, flavorful, well executed. I am just spoiled by other places in my current 'hood.\n\nIf I am in the area, and someone suggests the Blind Pig, I won't object. \nI also don't think I'd plan another meal there. Nothing in the world wrong with the place - just no \""wow\"" factor for me."
3,"The first night we arrived, it was close to midnight and this place was still open and serving.  Service was a little slow, but understandable for it being 12am and with a party of 12.  I don't even remember what I had there [I think a steak?], but the highlight of the meal was the fact that they did serve up a mean cup of fresh watermelon juice.\n\nAlthough service was a little slow, it was still friendly and courteous.  Prices are a tad pricey for a \""Cafe\"", but expected for a place like Aria.  We later discovered Aria's room service, the buffet and then we finally wised up and tried the local cuisine instead to save $.\n\nNot bad, but not worth it.  =("
3,"If you take a plate of breakfast potatoes, au gratin potatoes, and vegetable chow mein, then you cover the whole thing in melted  butter, what do you get?  You get the reason why the terrorists hate America... \n\nThe place was clean, the service was decent, and the food choices was what I expected for a downtown LV casino buffet: ordinary and plentiful.\n\nBut the large vat of melted butter?  You can put that sh*t on everything!"
3,"This is the place you want to go after a night of drinking. The food is typical Mexican food. The drive thru was quick and efficient. The major issue i had with this location is that the portion size on my Carne Asada fries was ridiculously small. Every other location i've been to usually gives you a good chunk of everything, but this location really got  stingy. That was a major disappointment. Ill revisit again in a couple of weeks and ill see if i have the same experience."
3,"Nothing too impressive. Burgers were pretty decent, but not out if this world. Onion rings were good. Price was expensive for what it was, in Vegas."
3,No complaints about the food or service. I can think of a few places in Vegas that make a better burger for a better price.
3,"This location is between my house and my parents' house so I'm a frequent visitor. Between my 2 girls and I, the drink orders can be quite challenging and this location is sort of hit or miss. The ever changing staff could be the culprit, but nonetheless the convenience of the location still draws me in. The lines tend to get long during the morning commute, yet they seem to move people through pretty quickly. On the occasion that I've had to send drinks back, they have been very apologetic and cooperative."
3,"Came here on a friday night for drinks. Fun place to check out. People said its like being at a beach, definitely didnt get that feeling. However, drinks were good. Bartender didnt make a three wise men correctly. DJ played really good music. Probly wont come here for tacos though."
3,"Was able to go in without a wait. Part of the Westin Hotel, there is a nice decor to the OFM, but the clientele seem to be going elsewhere.\n\nOur server was very helpful and gave us some suggestions on what to order. We asked about what sushi rolls we could start off with as appetizers for the group, and he suggested two that worked very well. They were both tuna-based, one mild and one spicier. It definitely lives up to the claim that OFM has some good sushi.\n\nWe then ordered our mains, and I got the cioppino. Now, I'm used to cioppino coming out as a stew with chunks of fish in a broth, but OFM's chef has decided to serve an entire slab of mahi on a thin layer of the broth with the accompanying shellfish. The dish was cooked well, but the presentation (lack of actual stew) left me wanting for more.\n\nThe caesar salad was pretty good, with actual anchovies on top.\n\nThe Hawaiian waluu dish got a thumbs up.\n\nThe crab cakes were also said to be very tasty.\n\nOverall, the experience was nice and relaxed, and the service is friendly. However, the food itself (besides the sushi) needs to be reinvigorated somehow to get it back into competition with all the new kids on the block."
3,"I've been back a couple of times since the new ownership, and things are getting better, so I'm giving them one more star.  The service has improved, and they have brought back some of the old chefs.   Worth a visit.   But sure wish the new owner wouldn't hover around the sushi bar, looking like he wants to make sure the chefs don't serve too much fish."
3,"Ordered the 2 eggs and potatoes which was only $3.85...DEAL!  I asked for the eggs to be scrambled and it came with home fries and toast.  I know my meal wasn't that exciting and can you really mess up eggs, toast or potatoes?!?!\n\nThe eggs and toast were fine - something I could've made at home.  But the home fries left something to be desired.  They had no flavor - it's like someone boiled some potatoes and slapped them in a pan and served them on a plate.  I put some salt and pepper on them, but it didn't really help - it's like the potatoes were determined to be tasteless.  I ate a few forkfuls and just gave up.  \n\nI came here for a meeting in the morning and it wasn't crowded.  Looked like there were some regulars but fairly low key.  I could definitely see how peeps who come here after a night of being out.  \n\nI'm not sure that I'd make it a point to go to Ritters unless it was a night out and I needed a place open 24 hours.  They are CASH only!"
3,"You know - I wanted to write \""I love Sunset Grille\"", but then I thought about it and it really occurred to me that I don't love Sunset Grille.  I like Sunset Grille, and I will return to Sunset Grille, but it's not my favorite place in Charlotte.  \n\nIt's OK.  The service is great, the layout is cool and it appears to have a happening bar if you hit it at the right time.  Food-wise, it's just OK.  I love breakfast sandwiches (and you should try this place for brunch...), but they do not have a typical breakfast sandwich, which was disappointing.  I had an Eggs Benedict's, sans Hollandaise (because you should not really eat that in a restaurant unless you know they made it right then - Thanks Anthony Bourdain for that tip).  The canadian bacon was really, really, really salty though.  \n\nOther things I have had: An open face turkey sandwich, which now that I think about it - was salty too.  I also tried a blackbean burger with fries that was OK.  \n\nSo, as I wrote above - the more I think about it, Sunset is OK.  They try hard and are extremely attentive there, but there are better places for food in my opinion."
3,"Is it better than Chipukele?  Sure.  Is that saying much?  Not really. The best part about this place is their tortillas which are hand-made right in front of you.  The corn tortillas are delicious.\n\nI found the sweet pork to be WAY too sweet.  The shredded beef was OK.  The rice and pinto beans, IMO, were the best part.  I guess if I had to go to Chipotle, I'd pick this place, but if there was no gun to my head, it would be easy to forget about this establishment.  There wasn't really anything wrong with it, it's just there."
3,"I love Thai food.  The food here is okay, the price is too much for the portions at lunch.  I told him I did not want it too spicy, he did not add any seasonings.  I may go back just not on my dime."
3,"After complaining about NC BBQ in another review, I feel guilty admitting that the chicken sandwich here was not too bad. The fried pickle was delicious, firm and warm and just the right amount of batter. I'd go back just for the pickle! The price was okay for an airport establishment and afterwards I could enjoy the free wi-fi (and power source) from one of the rocking chairs. Charlotte Airport is not too bad, and this restaurant is worth a stop."
3,Good food. Way too chaotic!  Very loud. Nowhere to sit because tables aren't bused. Half the price of PF Chang's but miss the ambiance.
3,"Maybe the novelty of In-n-Out has worn off on me. I didn't find this location to be any different than the ones I used to eat at in California, but I guess my tastes have matured. For all the hype and history, in the end it's just a fast food burger (although a decent one)."
3,"I made the mistake of arriving for my 11PM reservation with a hangover, so I didn't quite get to enjoy the full excellence. Seating was very cramped, but in full view of the kitchen, which made the experience much more enjoyable. Food was good, but expect to spend $$$. \n\nOh, and make reservations EARLY. The night before my reservation someone offered me $500 for it, so that's a good indication of the popularity of the place."
3,"The BEST THING about this hotel is the made-to-order breakfast.  We received a ticket to take down to the dining room and selected an entree:  eggs, french toast, or pancakes, which came with potatoes and sausage or bacon.  Also provided is a selection of cereals, oatmeal, bread/toast, muffin, and fruit, as well as juice, milk and coffee.\n\nThe LOCATION is great!  It's right across (a block or so away) from the mall and several restaurants; it is also right off the interstate too.   \n\nWe liked how spacious THE ROOM was (King with sleeper sofa)  The room was like a little studio/efficiency with a full refrigerator, stove, and microwave.  The room was clean.\n\nThe not-so-good things are as follows:\n\n1.  The room felt stuffy every time we entered.  We kicked up the air conditioning but got too cold.  There was no happy medium for crisp, cool air at a comfortable temperature.  \n\n2.  The pillows were flat; using two pillows didn't help.  \n\n3.  The stairs are steep in this two-story hotel, which lacks an elevator.  If you have trouble with stairs or have lots of luggage, you may be better off to request something on the first floor.\n\nOVERALL, this is a very decent place to stay.  It's not too expensive; it's not too fancy; and it provides an amicable atmosphere for an overnight stay."
3,"Apparently this is the largest restaurant in the state of Arizona. From the outside and the dining area I ate in, could have fooled me. A good friend of mine was working his last shift as a server so that is why I went. Not a huge fan of steakhouses. \n\nThe atmosphere was pretty throw-back, 70s vibe, someplace your grandpa and dad would take you for your first real steak experience. It was dark inside and they sitting area had a retro feel like an Arizona mobster may be biting down into his steak right next to you. I was told there's a lot of history in the building so I respected the decor. \n\nI order a wonderful shrimp salad that came topped with the biggest, juiciest shrimps I've seen in a long time. I saved them for last because they were so crunchy to eat. My roommate ordered a sirloin and sadly had to send it back twice to get it recooked. Our wiater said that wsn't the first time that evening that had happened with someone's food and that particular chef. But the bread basket made up for it. With wonderful rosemary topped, the bread was light and buttery. \n\nBest part of the night? Check in on Foursquare and you can get a beer for .5 cents at the bar. We knew the waiter so he hooked us up at the table, but I have NEVER seen a deal that insane on Fourswaure before."
3,"Things I liked: \n-Reasonable priced casual lunch food at Mandalay Bay. Which says a lot for Vegas. \n-Less than 10 minute wait time to seat our party of 10 ppl. \n-Available seating soon after the Rock and Roll 1/2 marathon, which says a LOT, considering the race wrapped up just outside MB. We assumed this place could be jammed up. \n-Burgers were good, but after 13 miles, anything would have tasted good! \n\nThings I did not like: \n-They were out of sweet potato fries. We were so excited to have some. Huge bummer. \n-For not being jam packed with patrons, the service was rather slow. We had to ask a few ppl to find a server to bring water and take our orders. \n-Many of our orders were not prepared as requested. Onions were included when they should not have been. Salad was delivered after the entree. Some entrees were served 5-8 minutes before the rest of the party. Stuff like that. \n\nSo, it was just OK. Not in a huge hurry to return."
3,"Most recent visit was quite different than our prior visits.  Things seemed discombobulated.  30 minute wait to be seated (for a 6PM reservation), challenges with getting our club 837 benefits due to some glitches.  Small Caesar instead of regular Caesar salad.  5lb lobster just didn't seem to be 5 lbs (maybe we are wrong on that one, but I just didn't look right).  Just a very \""glitchy\"" visit.  I inquired if tthere had been any changes in the restaurant recently (ownership, management, etc.).  I was told that the restaurant manager role had recently changed hands.  We love the palm, so we will be back, but a caution flag for seasoned Palm diners.  I expect this is just a aberrant experience we had or, alternatively, some growing pains with the management transition.  Food tasted good, food was well prepared.  Like I said - just unusually glitchy..."
3,"Steak and Eggs!!!\n\nAfter a night of drinking and dancing, this is the place to stop by before heading back to the hotel.  Cheap food (although not the best quality... but you get what you pay for) and a place to rest your head while waiting for the food.\n\nUsually there is a long waiting line because everyone has the same agenda as you (eat before going back to their hotel), but if you put your name on the list and wait around, you will see that the people ahead of you in line will start to disappear because they are tired of waiting or a slot machine nearby was calling their name.  LOL"
3,"I ordered an almond taro milk tea, which was pretty good. However, the popcorn chicken is not the typical popcorn I was expecting. And I got a bunch of breaded pieces left :/"
3,"This was was my first visit to smash em up, bash em up burger.  The staff was very friendly upon taking my order and was really good about saying about how long it would take for the food.   I had the classic smash 1/3 pounder and it was good, except it was not done quite enough.  I found it surprising that they didn't ask me how I liked my burger cooked.  For $10, I thought they should have asked.  The food was hot and tasty, I just didn't find it visually appealing for the price.  For a couple bucks less I'd rather go to Culvers.  The decor is minimalist and feels very corporatized.  My friend who suggested the place asked if they actually grilled their burgers and we found out they use 80/20 ground beef.  That was also a bit surprising but then they seemed a little on the greasy side.  I'd come back again, but seems like these places are a dime a dozen.  This one does not come out on my top five burger places."
3,"The chicken here is one of my favorites from any other fast food place in town. Crispy and super-southern! They also have an extensive menu on side choices, from mashed potatoes to a few types of beans, coleslaw, and even mac n cheese (DING DING DING winner) \n\nWhile the food here is delicious, the service sucks. I've never come in to contact with so many people that hate their lives than I have at this particular location. You just walk into the place and the cashier gives you this snooty look of HOW DARE YOU COME HERE. Like, bitch please I just want some chicken not your first born child.\n\nNever go through the drive-thru if you can, at this location either. I've only done it about 3 times, and EVERY GODDAMN time, they fucked up my order, or didn't give me a fork or some shit. Plus the girl running the drive-thru window has a shit ton of acne, super gross face. She'll make you lose your appetite."
3,"Came here on a Sunday afternoon to catch some football and grab a bite - was able to get seated at the bar fairly quickly which was nice. \n\nPortions are large. Interesting classics as well as special items... however the food was still just ok. It got the job done, but I definitely would not come here JUST for the food. \n\nService was pretty terrible... our server/ bartender Randi was really nice and sweet, however when it came time to pay the billl (which we had a comped code for) she messed up the transaction and had to get her manager. HE took about 30-40 minutes trying to figure out the issue... he literally just disappeared for 30 minutes.... the least he could've done was come back and say he's still working on it, or SOMETHING?! \n\nIn the end though, our meal was comped (through gambling enough) and the manager figured it out. Great place to come check out sports, but don't expect more."
3,"Some of the varieties of pizza taste much better then others.  However, none of them are overly great.  This location used to be much cleaner but it appears management may have changed and the service has gone downhill a bit.  I do find the cinnamon rolls to be addictively good though.  So I keep going back to get my fix."
3,It is a small crowded place serving inexpensive and ok food. But I think it is over rated in yelp.
3,"Nothing to do on a summer night? Head out to a Hounds game. Prices are cheap - certainly more so than about any other sports team in the area, and most nights you'll get to hang out with a bunch of other folks and see and be seen.\n\nThe only problem? While lacrosse may be an up-and-coming sport, it's in the same boat as soccer when it comes to being a spectator: It just isn't that great to watch. That isn't to say that these guys don't play hard, because they do. But since there just isn't much to do other than hang out and watch them run around, and occasionally score, the best thing to do at a Hounds game is to socialize and enjoy a nice summer evening.\n\nAlso, huge kudos to the Hounds for making use of Memorial Stadium. Have to love that this oldie isn't going to waste, or even worse, being demolished to make use for some new development that may never even happen."
3,"I give this pace 3.5 stars but can understand why some people give it 4. The food and service are 4 stars but the tapas are very overpriced. I have been in Spain many times and have tried many tapas (in fancy and not so fancy Spanish restaurants), but the prices in Jaleo are ridiculous particularly the cheese tapas. Highly recommend the paellas."
3,"This place is alright. Kitschy name, fine food. Nothing spectacular at the bar. Nothing amazing on the menu. \n\nThis is a neighborhood bar, there are always regulars in. Not a bad sort, some of them can be quite drunk at times though."
3,"Couldn't make split pizza, prices way too high.  The highest I ever seen on a pizza. $26 for a large is ridiculous.  Athens pizza down the road was a lot better and cheaper and tasted better."
3,its always good to have some Chinese food after a few buffets...\n\ncame here for lunch... food is pricy for chinese food and dim sum... but i came here on comps... so it didnt matter...\n\nthe salmon cold noodle was superb... apart from that... everything is just slightly about average...
3,We all need a good British pub in our lives. The bar tenders are down to earth. No frills just drinks and ok food. Great to watch games and after work HH.
3,The reviews for this restaurant were overwhelmingly positive.  Service was great and we were served an accompaniment of vegetables with our dish.  We had the fried dumplings as an appetizer which were tasty but I wish there was more to the filling.  The same goes for the bibimbap.  It was served in a sizzling stone pot.  It had beef but honestly the pieces were minuscule and I was hard-pressed to find or taste it because the rice made up most of the dish.  I suggest they increase the amount and size of the beef and veges and reduce the amount of rice.
3,"Decent bean and cheese, but the cheese is cold and not melted. They use oil, supposedly, instead of lard so thats a plus. Green salsa is good, would be nice if served a small side of chips though,. Hard tacos good but way too much iceburg lettuce, it filled half the taco shell."
3,"3 Stars.\n\nThis place is big and I dig the decor.  It was cold so we did not go outside but there is an upstairs balcony area which apparently is pretty neat when the weather is appropriate.  There were two rooms with two different DJs.  One was just hip hop and the other was a top 40 type.  I actually thought the DJ in the top 40 (main room) was terrible...the guy had trouble beat matching playing top 40 stuff...lame.  Given that its Vegas and that it was New Years Day (not eve, but still) I would expect that some of the areas best DJs would be at most of these Vegas clubs.  Maybe he was just having a bad night.\n\nI must say, in most clubs the staff/bouncers are rude as hell but they were quite nice here.  The cover charge if your a normal dude is $40 on the weekends and $20 for ladies.  STEEP!  Especially when that allows you to buy $10 beers at the bar.  I was not going to pay $60 to get me and my girl in.  The bouncer let my girl in for free and I just paid the $40 so for two people $20 a pop if you don't \""know anyone\"" is normal Vegas club pricing I suppose   \n\nI dont think I would go back unless I was staying at Ceaser's, not because it was a negative experience but I just think I would want to try a new club."
3,Just ate here (take out) and I had the pad tai and PH\u00d2.... The restaurant was bright and u could tell it was new it was very cute. Service was very very friendly and prompt. Pad tai was excellent everything I expected and I tried my friends beef which was also great... I mainly went there to get ph\u00f2 because we don't have any PH\u00d2 on the NW side and I was sick so ph\u00f2 was exactly what I needed... Boy oh boy was I disappointed!!! After reading all the reviews I was excited but when I opened the container to the broth it didn't smell like it usually smells so I sipped it and it tasted sweet and a little thick disgusting!!! It was also dark brown even though I ordered chicken ph\u00f2... I gave it the benefit of the doubt and added the noodles and spices and chicken like I like and tried it again but I couldn't bare the smell and taste... Instead I drained the juice and just ate the noodles... Would have given this place 5 stars if it wasn't for the terrible ph\u00f2... Maybe i went on a bad day?
3,"Cheap drinks for happy hour for sure. Tiny bar with real \""creekers\"".. very smokey and loud with serious drinkers. This is where you find the locals. Hit or miss with the entertainment but the crowd itself is entertaining enough. I have had a few dishes there that were tasty. Free popcorn inside if you go into the indoor bar. P.S. The dartboard sucks, bring your own plastic darts if you want them to stick. The staff is friendly, never had a problem here."
3,"Best fast food in this area of T-bird and 59th Ave.  I don't know why Del-Taco even bothers to be there on the same corner.  \n\nChipotle is relaibly good quality food, especially the bean or veggie burritos.  However I don't like that they upcharge for the chips/salsa so much, because I'm spending nearly $8 for a simple burrito, coke, chips/salsa lunch.  \n\nThis location could do a better job at keeping the dining area clean."
3,"I've been to Daisho sushi twice, once when it first opened, and earlier this evening. It was ok. Their nigiri was good & fresh, and their green tea ice cream was yummy. The service was ok, and the rolls we ordered didn't have much flavor. Perhaps we ordered the wrong rolls... Since I live across the street I thought I would give it a try, but I'll keep going to my regular sushi spot for the same AYCE price."
3,"I always drive by this place and decided to see what it's all about.  I wasn't hungry, so decided to buy a loaf of sourdough bread.  Granted it was a few days before Christmas, so I guess it was busier than usual.  There were less than 10 people when I came in, but I waited about 10 minutes to pay for my bread.  Maybe I was a little impatient, but if I waited any longer I would've walked out of that place.  In my opinion, the workers were really slow.  I've worked in retail and you never want your customers waiting too long to pay, especially if it's bread!  I'm mean, don't they want my money?  \n\nOn a positive note, the sourdough bread was really good and would probably continue buying my bread there.  Hopefully their cashiers become more efficient."
3,"My Fam and I are big fans of the food here. We usually go through drive thru. Our orders are usually fresh, hot and delicious but lately the older woman with the heavily penciled in eyebrows working the window has been having a bad case of the grumps. She acts like anything you say or ask for is a huge inconvenience, is very condescending and just plain acts like she hates her job. Another Mexican food restaurant has thankfully opened up further down Greenway to replace this place. Unfortunately the rudeness has overshadowed the tasty food here. 3 stars Rivas!!! Attitude adjustment please!!'"
3,"Great location overlooking the pool and the food was good!  A little pricey for how basic the meals were, but nothing above the norm for the M.Bay."
3,"I was amazed how large the place was once inside and how quickly they were able to seat me even though they appeared busy.  I had my drink order in quickly and was reviewing their menu within minutes of sitting down.\n\nI ordered the AYCE which is a great price of $20 especially given the majority of the rolls were $10 or more each.  I ordered 5 in total, so it was a great deal for the quantity of food I received. The quality however was just about average to maybe a little better.  The presentation of the food was bland and once my initial order was in, it took several attempts to stop my waitress, even though the place had cleared out completely by then.\n\nI felt a little uncomfortable having to keep asking for more tea and waiting almost 20 minutes after asking for the bill.  The food was good for $20 AYCE, however the service wasn't.  I will give them another try in a few months as I could have caught them on a bad night, but for $20 and the fact I was stuffed when I left, it is worth another try."
3,"Just because you are in Vegas don't expect to wine and dine here.  This is meant to be a quick service restaurant with food to satisfy hunger, not give you the \""wow\"" factor.\n\nHad the prosciutto sandwich and it tasted just as I anticipated.  Crusty baguette, prosciutto di parma, mozzarella, arugula, and balsamic.  Simple, fast, and on the go.  The cheese pizza would have used some extra time in the oven because the under crust had gone soggy."
3,"I stopped in earlier this month with a friend. We went on a Tuesday night, and almost completely had the place to ourselves. That was OK  as we were able to chat without yelling @ each other, and were able to chat a little bit with Heidi. Great gal...very friendly service. I ordered the Oggie (The Traditional Pasty), mushy peas (mainly after gauging my friend's expression of comfort to see them on the menu...childhood memories no doubt), and chips (potato wedges). I wasn't overwhelmed by the food. However, is English food ever overwhelming?. The pasty was a little dry and the wine gravy takes some getting used to. Although the beef was lean, it wasn't too tender. I can't say I'd recommend on the food, but the Strongbow Cider and the Hoegaarden were both pretty good. Also stuck around to play some Cricket @ the dartboard, which probably wouldn't have normally been available. I think it seems like a good place to have some drinks with friends, and soak up a good crowd atmosphere on a busier night."
3,"Meeeehhh...it was ok.  My friend and I had heard good things, so we decided to buy tickets for our second night in Vegas....it was very cheesy and most of the guys couldn't dance at all!!  Some were very ahead/behind the rest of the group and it just looked like they haphazardly put the routines together...for what it was, it was entertaining, but would I go again?  No thanks....some of the guys were cute, but some were kind of scary looking (the long-haired guy that got wayy too into it, for example)...the best part?  The host/announcer was hilarious and made the show much more tolerable.  If you ladies are out for a bachelorette party, this really is a good place to embarass the bride-to-be...trust me!!"
3,Not bad for Vegas but any one from Chicago will tell you the bread is wrong fix that and you got a great sandwich
3,"Stopped by here because we needed a quick bite to eat before the Michael Jackson One show.  Thought it would be faster if we went to the bar. Took a while for the bartender to show up, but once she did service was fine. We had the chili cheese kobe beef fries, which hit the spot. Decent place to watch sports as well."
3,"Going to Avalon always seems like a really great idea until I actually go. Don't get me wrong, this is hip and you can find some pretty cool stuff occasionally, but for me it's really hit or miss. Sometimes I have a really hard time understanding how they price their items. Once I picked our a tshirt that had holes in it and it was $14. As far as \""thrift stores\"" go, I wouldn't exactly say its super thrifty, but I have gotten a few items priced lower than they would have originally been stores (AE jeans, Urban Outfitter top). \n\nAnother thing I don't understand is how their buying process works. I've taken clothes here a few times to sell...and that process is also hit or miss. I've taken almost new, \""in-style\"" clothes there and they didn't take anything, but then you look on the racks and they have clothes that look like they should belong to someone's Grandma. \n\nIn conclusion, shopping here is definitely always a mixed bag, however any time I'm in Squirrel Hill I make sure I stop in just to see what they have. They also always have a very good selection of Halloween costumes in October."
3,"This store makes every other Sally Beauty Supply I have been into look like a closet. It's seriously about double the size, with tons more product on the shelves. \n\nWhen I stopped in recently after work, there were 3 people working. I was greeted by one employee as I came in, she didn't exactly look stoked to be there but she was polite. \n\nAll I was doing was quickly picking up some nail polish (using the $5 coupon I had from joining the Sally Beauty Club!) so I didn't need any assistance. The cashier was friendly as she rang me up, and I am sure I will be back."
3,"3.5 stars for cheap Jameson, somewhat decent food, and a fun patio.\n\nNever thought I'd be a Yelp app regular at Gilley's, but lo and behold, there was my golden checkmark (of shame). I visited a while back with Dana S (the S is for Some Hot Bitch) where we got cheap Jame-O and loled at karaoke. \n\nVisited again recently for food and more drinks, and I was not disappointed (but then again, I was not paying). The nachos were alright--tasted like my beloved Taco John's  which is a pretty good compliment coming from me. The chicken strips were just that--frozen animal flesh fried in un-food batter and grease--but the vinegary mustardy sauce sold me. Also had a bite of the jalapeno grits which were the highlight of the meal.\n\nOverall, not a terrible place, but not the best either. The Strip has so much more to offer but in a pinch, this place wasn't horrible."
3,"So, I would have rate this place less if it were not for the celebrities that were seen here...\nI'm not sure if there was even a dance floor but if there was one, that was the smallest dance floor ever at a club. The music was ok and the club was more of place to chill. When we went girls got in for free and champagne was complimentary.\nWe went Valentine's weekend and we were about to leave at midnight (because the music was not to our liking) until we saw LMFAO! We stayed for the whole night just for them...it was AWESOME!\nMy friends also have been there last year and said that they saw Far East Movement...so pick your weekends wisely..."
3,"If you like half naked, drop dead gorgeous waitresses and alcohol, you should have no problem enjoying a night here. \n\nIf good service and 5 star food is more your speed, travel elsewhere. \n\nSure, you might get the wrong bill brought to your table, twice, and maybe the drinks are inconsistent and the food sub par, but let's face it. You shouldn't be coming here for much more. The beer is cold and the women are beautiful and really, everything else you can get somewhere else."
3,"You can't go wrong with a sub from Jimmy Johns-perfect place for lunch. They deliver or a quick place to stop in and get your order.  One of the best secrets is the nine grain bread you can choose to get your sub on instead of the white roll. It is so tasty!  I always go for the beach club-turkery, provolone cheese, tomatoe, lettuce, and guacamole.  One of my favorite things about this place is the option to get guacamole on the sub.  I also highly recommend the vegggie sub-sprouts, cheese, tomatoe, cucumber and more gucamole! Their cookies which are huge (especially the chocolate chip) are delicious!"
3,Always a good choice. Service is VERY slow but the corn chowder makes up for it. Good menu choices and staff seems to always be friendly. They also have good breads and muffins. Good place for any of the 3 meals.
3,"I went to enso for lunch the other day with one other person. The ginger salad was just like you would expect. The sushi really pretty but tasted just like typical sushi. The spider roll was awesome. As for atmosphere, it's way too dark inside and it's super swanky. The place is run by Americans and there is nothing authentic about it. We ended up spending $100 without any alcohol. It's pretty good but not worth the price. Head to New Zealand cafe for better sushi for half the price."
3,"First off, I love their sandwiches. I always get the Turkey, ranch and bacon. But, I cannot stand the new Coke machine all these places are getting. Every drink comes out tasting like it has lime juice in it. What's up with that? Even if I let it run for a few seconds it is nasty. I cannot eat there because of this reason. Too bad because the sandwiches and staff rock! I guess it's take out or nothing."
3,"We went in the hopes of utilizing one of the best rooftops in the city, only to be told we could order to go food and sit up there but we'd have to clean it up ourselves and come get anything we needed ourselves.  What a waste of prime real estate!\nThe service was decent.  Our waitress was lovely, although a little flighty.  She brought my husband & I 2 beers although we had only ordered one.\nThe food mediocre.  Not horrible, yet nothing I'm going to seek out.  We had the pork queso dip, which was really good, although not as spicy as I usually think of queso.  I would definitely order it again.  I ordered the Cuban.  I tried it with the lettuce and tomato as recommended by the waitress.  Not a fan.  They overpowered the flavor of the BBQ completely.  Once I got them off the sandwich, the BBQ was pretty good.  My husband ordered the straight BBQ sandwich.  He enjoyed the taste of the meat, but again, it was nothing to write home about.\nThis place is not going to be included in our regular rotation but I won't argue if someone else wants to go there."
3,"I live down the street from this WH so my circle of friends often finds ourselves here after a night of debauchery. It's really nothing special, trucker food at it's best, but the staff is really nice and there's something about it that makes my hangovers feel better."
3,What I liked about this place was that it looks like you have landed on Mars. Just check out some of the rock formations outside. What I do not like about this place is that it is in Arizona. Enough said.
3,"I am really torn about this review.  Our server was fantastic and we really enjoyed the food and drink, but two of our group members ended up with food poisoning (we think that it was the mussels) after our meal.  We opted to do a mix of plates including their jumbo lump crab cake, braised short ribs pierogies, arancinis. potato gnocchi & lobster, and the mussels.  Overall, during the meal - I enjoyed all of the food with my favorite being the lobster gnocchi and the arancinis were a bit bitter from the port wine.  \n\nWe also tried a smattering of their drinks from the Braddock's smash to the moscow mule and prohibition pear martini.  They also have a make your own manhattan option.  For a hotel restaurant, this was a really great option inside of The Renaissance which is eclectically upscale.  If it wasn't for the food poisoning, this review would be four stars."
3,"This is quite an inconspicuous wee bar at the bottom of Howe Street, but it's pretty popular with New Town and Stockbridge locals, and actually surprisingly larger than it looks when you get inside. \n\nThe interior of The Standard is smart and plushly furnished, so it's a pretty comfortable place to sit and have a beer, or a nice Sauvignon, or whatever your poison may be. The bar has a good feel about it, so you can sit for quite a while and banter away without actually feeling you're really in a bar environment (apart from the fact you're glugging down alcohol). \n\nThe menu is decent too and inexpensive, so if you're in the mood for proper pub food, like a big helping of burger and chips, or a full breakfast to soak up the hangover, The Standard is a good call. I am automatically biased against anywhere that blares out sport at high volume levels, but I know half the world love watching a good sports match/game on decent screens, so I would recommend The Standard for such activities, and it gets very, very busy around rugby match season."
3,"I visit Chili's with family and friends about two times per month. We usually go to the the one at Bell and 7th St. or 27th Ave and 101. The food for the most part is at least average to above average. The chips and salsa are a good deal and the green chile and enchilada soups are great. The food is pleasingly the same at each Chili's we visit. However, there seems to be an ongoing kink in the service at the one on North Valley Parkway. When they first opened a while back, we tried them twice because they are close to home. Both times, the orders were messed up and the waitresses were friendly but not very knowledgeable about the menu. The food took forever to arrive and no hint of an apology anywhere. A few months later we decide to try again. maybe they were just new and by now they have the kinks out. Again, the wait time for our food was incredible and getting a drink refill was just wishful thinking.  \nFast forward over a year. Last Saturday-Nice waitress, seemingly nice greeters, food was as expected. Over 90 minutes for soup and salad and water to drink. Four times with the same problem is probably not coincidence. The Chilis on 7th St always has the exact opposite. Great service and normal wait time. Hope it changes, it is a decent place to go."
3,"A good local buffet. I thought the sashimi was very fresh, especially the salmon. Chinese traditional dishes we're very good and everything is refilled extremely fast. Crab legs were very good as well and plentiful. Spring rolls were terrible and the dumplings could be better.  \n***Make sure you read the sign on the table before going up to to the buffet.\"" If you take to much food and leave enough waste your plate then there is an $8 additional charge\""**\nRecommended though as far as Chinese buffets go."
3,"Can't get a reservation at Pied Au Corchon? This place makes an excellent alternative! \n\nFresh, well-executed dishes, manageable portions, and upscale rustic ambiance make this restaurant an good choice for out-of-town guests or (smallish) group dinners. Downsides include slowish service and a noisy dining experience.\n\nMy dinner was very tasty, and mostly worth the expense. I had the veal heart tartar, which was fresh and robust (though it could have used a pinch of something, I don't know what that something might have been). It came with thin fries, which are very thin, nicely cooked, and perfectly salted, and a finely sliced raw vegetable salad under a vinaigrette. For dessert, I shared the apple tarte for two. The tarte was nicely presented, and had slightly vinegared apple slices (a strange but unique addition) and a tiny scoop of apple sorbet (would have loved an entire dish of that!) on top as a garnish. It wasn't anything special, but it was nice and hot, with a nicely flakey crust.\n\nOverall, as said, the place is worth the expense, and makes a great alternative to some of the more famous upscale restaurants in Le Plateau."
3,"French press coffee tasted like water, with leftover grounds in it. One thing you expect from a breakfast place is good coffee, if not great. The coffee I got, at least, was terrible.\n\nAnd you would think place called \""Morning Squeeze\"" would have fresh squeezed or blended juices; this place does not. Hopefully, they'll make some tweaks and get themselves up a notch or two. The place has a good vibe."
3,"this place has some serious potentional. the tv's are set up perfect including in the bathrooms. i would definitely give this place 5 stars if they had higher quality food and more selection of beers on tap and liquors. i've tried getting crown royal cask no 16, jack daniels honey, kracken, captain morgan private stock, jack daniels single barrel but they don't any of them. half moon hello!!!! not everyone wants to drink bottom shelf or bottom of the barrel liquor. please fix these 2 problem so i can give another review and it be 5-stars"
3,Just came here and ordered a caesars salad. It was a snack between meals. It was dressed nicely but slightly overseasoned. Nice casual place.
3,"Restaurant review\nMy first venture into Korean food in Champaign was good. We decided to stop for a quick lunch and ended up at the first restaurant that opened at 11 AM on a weekday. It was easy to order because we were the first customers of the day. They have a nice laminated menu at the desk to chose your entree. It would be nicer if they had pictures instead of a word description of each item. I selected the combo platter of bulgogi which was 9.99. Afterwards it was a long wait of approximately 25 minutes before we got our food. The dish itself came with a large amount of rice and 2 ban chae along with a bean soup. Based on the pictures I could have chose the beef bulgogi paid less and likely gotten the same amount of food except less variety. The bulgogi was well seasoned, but the meat was cut into smaller slices which detracted from it. Prices have gone up according to my wife since she was in college. Overall slightly above average, I will have to find another korean restaurant to compare too.\n\nPro: average price korean food, large portion\n\nCons: long cook time, higher price than average lunch places\n\nHidden gem:\nYour meal comes with rice, soup, and 2 korean ban chae"
3,"Food is hit and miss, I noticed that the food is horrible in the afternoon (salty fries, bland meat etc..) but fantastic at night. Sandwiches are good. their BBQ ribs when they have them are a joke. I am not much of a drinker so I cannot comment on the Bar but just the grill :-)"
3,"I was on a solo trip to Arizona and I wanted to make sure i stopped to try local food ...or actually real Native American Food... The Fry Bread House was my first spot I went to, to try the culture out!...  The food has some SPICE to it for sure!! What i Had was SPICY but it was good...The bread is made to order and tasty.. Im not sure what I would recommend there because I have not tried many of the items...but the flatbread is pretty good :)"
3,"I don't know why, but this Bruegger's stands head and shoulders above the location three blocks away on Grant.  Employees are almost always in good spirits and much more efficient at taking orders.\n\nLike most Bruegger's, they have the standard Bagel, Sandwich, Soup, Coffee and Tea selection.  They also have nice booth seating along an outside window."
3,"The atmosphere is great. The prices are right. The wine-a-ritas are different, tasty but just ok. The local wines are a bit light, I prefer CA wines but they were still good, a bit over priced. I would have bought the pinot grigio but didn't think it was worth $25. I would go again and definitly will order the flight for $6. Pick any 6 for $6. whatta deal!"
3,"This is a very average to above average sushi restaurant.  The bar is nice, seating is limited (like most sushi places).  The sushi is good, but completely unremarkable.  On par with Ra, but not in the same league as Sakana.  I agonized over a fourth star, but it was just so average."
3,"Great wings but sad to say they are now closed - looking at the past reviews of slow service, that might have been the reason why."
3,"Decent pizza. Wings were a little dry, but I'll chalk it up to a bad batch. Sauce was good. still looking for a slice of NY in the 'Burgh though."
3,"Food was great as usual.  Love the new building.  However, the chairs are probably the most uncomfortable chairs I've ever sat in and the music was way too loud.  I don't like shouting at my dinner companions to be heard.  Get better chairs and turn it down during dinner time, please.  If it's going to remain that loud, I'll just get my food to go."
3,"It's nice to finally find an uptown lunch spot that focuses on honest health instead of hiding behind vague menu descriptions and health information from the 1980s, like so many others.  This place really impresses me with their commitment to healthy, natural ingredients.\nOverall, I think the food is very good, and the menu options are as extensive as they need to be to make this a weekly lunch stop.  However, I have one issue with the price point, particularly with breakfast.  The cost of a breakfast sandwich is pretty outrageous for what you actually get.  For $5, i don't expect someone to reach into a steamer and pull out a 2 hour old poached egg, place it on a stale wrap, and throw a pinch of turkey bacon on it and call it a decent breakfast.\nIn contrast though, the lunch is spectacular.  You definitely get a decent bang for the buck, especially if you eat in (tea refills and complimentary froyo).  In my experiences, it always tastes fresh, healthy, and delicious... and I'm actually somewhat full afterward. \nFor breakfast this place gets 2 stars, but for lunch it gets 4.  So an overall 3 it is."
3,"Sally's is a place to chase the evening after last call. They are heads and tails above any other option in the area for late night eats (everything other than fast food basically closes around 12). \nThe decor in Sally's is pretty bitchin': motorcycle memorabilia, 50's and 60's knick knacks, classic guitars, tatt'd guys and dolls serving and just a general veneer of rockabilly tinged throughout.\nPersonally Sally's isnt about the food so much as a gathering spot, a rallying point to fortify yourself w/ a snack and hours of convo until the eyelids are just too heavy to stay open and the booze no longer seems appealing.\nThe servers at SPS are generally very friendly.The booths are big and comfy. And the ice! oh the ice is sooo awesome! i love it, it's a weird thing to rave about but i have never had ice like that outside of a snow cone really lol!\nAll in all i like sally's, but it's nothing to write home about, just a decent place to stay up late.\nif only you could smoke inside, i'd bump my rating up to 5 stars, but thats not really for them to decide i suppose.."
3,"This place is alright. They play a mixture of music. Oldies, hip hop, rap, rock... We went on a Friday night. I thought about half the crowd there was a bit ghetto. The dance flow is small. On the plus side, they give away free stuff to those who wait early in line to get into the club and wait early in line to get the stuff. They were giving out clothings, but beware, they don't have much clothings to give. I would say they gave away probably 15 total, and many of the sizes were medium and large. They give 1 clothing per person. This place is pretty good for local ladies cuz it's free."
3,"First off, I am not a 20-something who regularly hangs out in Old Town.  But, I have lived in Phx for 30+ years and have been to most upper-level eating establishments around town.  We went with friends for Restaurant Week.  We will not be heading back any time soon.  Service was very attentive.  The ambiance has been overstated by many other reviewers - it's got a little bit of kitsch, but in the end, the tables are extremely close to each other and the noise level is on the high end.  It is definitely not an intimate dining experience.  The food was very good, but not home run material.  The entree of venison that I ordered was served raw on the inside.  I'm not talking a little bit on the rare side, it was sashimi raw.  Having not been asked how I would like my meat prepared, I assumed it would be cooked.  I'm a medium-well kinda guy, but my dining partner likes her meat medium rare and she sent hers back to be cooked.  We ordered a dessert of foie gras and donuts, and it was just weird.  All 4 of us tried it, but none of us liked it.  You must really have to like foie gras to enjoy this dessert.  We are not really cocktail kinda people, but they did look tempting.  The regular menu looks like it is probably over-priced for the serving sizes that we got during Restaurant Week, but it was worth trying once."
3,"We just tried Vogue a few weeks ago, for the first time... I had the meatloaf and my husband had the lasagna, we shared the calamari fritta appetizer.  Both the entrees were outstanding and worth every penny, even brought some home! The calamari was a disappointing, tempura fried, greasy mess... I think there were eight pieces of calamari hidden among the vast mass of julienned carrots! Unique touch to the calamari was ginger among the carrots, I love ginger so this was a spectacular treat, too bad I did not have enough calamari to really enjoy it!\n\nAs for the service, it was courteous and semi-prompt, but cold and impersonal. We felt like our waiter just wanted us to go away, he didn't hurry us, but he also didn't make us want to linger over a drink or desert."
3,"after 1 visit\n\nambience B+ loved the decor, however, the lighting was quite dark. it was hard to see anything. \n\nservice B+ i would have given pin kaow an A, however, they over-killed on the table touches. i think we had 5 people check on us in the matter of 5 minutes. \n\nfood B+ i enjoyed the dishes, but it didn't make me say, \""wow, this is REALLY good.\""\n\nchicken satay\nthe chicken was grilled perfectly. the peanut sauce (most likely an authentic sauce), fell a little flat on my palate.\n\ntom ka koong\nlemon grass soup with coconut milk, galanga root, mushroom, and shrimp\ngreat in small doses. i could only eat one small bowl, because it was a rich and slightly sour broth. the sourness wore on me at the end of one bowl. that same sourness is why so many people love this soup. it's just not for my palate.\n\nroasted rice beef\nbeef, cabbage, roasted rice, thai basil and spices\nroasted rice is a new concept for me. basically, it is crushed rice that has been roasted and scattered on the beef. interesting texture and a great experience. but not my favorite dish. \n\nchicken yellow curry\ndelicious.\n\noverall: B+\nhope to be able to visit this place again. sample some other dishes i've never sampled before."
3,"I hate it when you have one of those local places that just seems to fall short.  I like Monroe Hardware well enough, but they are not quite your old general store (like Mast Drug or even Renfrow in Matthews).  Yet neither are they a large chain like Home Depot or Lowe's.\n\nInstead, they fall somewhere in between.  Now I have never been to the location in Monroe, only this one in Mint Hill, and perhaps the issue is that they are in a truly cavernous space (used to be a Winn Dixie, I think - I know it was a grocery store of some kind).\n\nIf the building was perhaps half the size, it would be a much more intimate setting, and then it would be a lot better.  As it is now, it is just so spread out it seems like they are not filling it - and while the staff is nice, I can understand that they have a lot of ground to cover so it can seem like you are often left to your own devices.\n\nOn the good side, they are awfully close to our house, which makes it convenient.  But if I am really looking for a project, I will probably stop by Home Depot or Lowe's while I am out running other errands."
3,"This Dillard's is now ONLY an outlet center. The whole lower level is empty and closed. The upstairs now functions as the final destnation for last season's, damaged, and odd-sized designer wear. It's kind of like Ross, without all the junkie off-brands and pee-pee scented changing rooms.\n\nThe minimum discount I saw was 40% off. Most racks are labeled 50% off, and there are several 75% off racks to be found. They are also conveniently organized by size. \n\nMost of the items are by well-known designers. I picked up a Michael Kors top that was originally priced around $50 for $18. \n\nClothes are their mainstay. But there is also some bedding, accessories, and shoes. I found the shoe selection the most disappointing. Unless you have tiny little tootsies or big sasquatch feet, or if you like super gaudy styles, you're out of luck."
3,"Well, I think I established rather quickly that I am not the Vegas kind of gal.  I went with a friend who has connections, so we skipped the line and cover.  I wasn't wearing heels because I have a pinched nerve in my back, and the bouncer almost didn't let me in (I was wearing cute flats).\n\nFor such a \""great view\"" of the strip, I expected more- or for it to be at least be a bit higher.  It was just like-- oh hai! bright lights!  The dance floor was so packed you could barely move, and drinks were very expensive ($8/bottle of bug light).  Basically you're going to have people you don't know touching you at all times unless you pony up for a table.  Should you choose to go, do your wallet a favor and buy a few bottles of liquor at the CVS just north of the circus (~13 for smirnoff) and have a damn good buzz going before you get there."
3,"As far as chains go, Bravo is dependable. I can always count on getting a decent salad. This location offers reservations, which is helpful in avoiding long lines and 45 minute waits.\n\nI enjoy the Romano crusted chicken salad as well as the balsamic chicken salad. The Parmesan dressing is delicious, and I have even tried to recreate it at home.\n\nI am not a big fan of the entr\u00e9es here as they are loaded with salt, but I do enjoy stopping in to grab a salad while shopping at the Waterfront or catching a movie.\n\nThere is always plenty of parking, which is key."
3,"Black bean taco.  $2.  Better than any/every burrito I've had in Manhattan since I moved, but not as good as some of the other hotspots here in the Phoenix metro area.\n\nWe went before First Fridays, and the patio was super cute all lit up at the nighttime.  Our server had a delightful conversation with us about Shark Week, which, you know.  Good good stuff."
3,"I am with Jamie C. on this one.  I think maybe I will have to come back to make my final decision.  Our server was great!  I wish i would have got his name so I could mention him by name... very attentive!  I enjoyed the 2 glasses of sangria I had, but Michael was not that enthused about his mojito.  He switched to Stella for his second:).  For our entrees we shared the calamari and their special which was a blue corn chicken enchilada.  The calamari was very tasty!  I really liked the sauces that came with them and we ate it all!  The enchiladas were very tasty too.  There were many shared plates that I wanted to try so I will definitely come back!"
3,"We've heard and seen on the Food Network great things about Bouchon and certainly was not disappointed with the service. The dining hall is elegant and proper. Brunch was good, but not blow- your- mind great. We tried the Salmon Baguette, a take on salmon and smear on a bagel only for $15, but this is to be expected. Nevertheless, it was good. We also had the Bouchon French Toast which is done in a bread pudding- like style. It shouldn't be be called French toast because it does not resemble anything like it. It really should be called bread pudding. It was more like dessert-- too sweet to be had as a brunch meal."
3,"Aw, poor Kamakura, why all the hate?\n\nI have a soft spot for this place, because it's been a family favorite for YEARS - my dad took us there when they first opened because he had recently discovered sushi (remember when not everyone was aware of this heaven?  However pass\u00e9 it may be now, sushi had it's place 10ish years ago...), and we continued going back periodically.  Mostly for special occasions (my Prom group went here senior year), because for our standards at the time it was pricey.\n\nWe still stop in most every time I visit, usually for the Teppan.  I can't tell if the chefs/waiters aren't as jazzed about their restaurant as they used to be, or if it's just my perspective that's changed.  Either way, the experience is never \""special\"" like it was back in the day.\n\nStill, they do well.  I'm surprised at the negative reviews because, to be honest, Kamakura would likely earn a solid 3.5-star average where I currently hail from (LA), and I would have thought we had higher standards for cuisine -- especially of the Asian variety -- out here.   !"
3,"A very cute gift shop, with adorable and quirky gift ideas. \nHowever, as Emily T pointed out the price tags are quite high when you start considering the actual item on sale. \n\nStill Miam Miam can be a saver when you are stuck on a present for someone that's a bit more unique but not too crazy. When I came in here it was empty (coincidence or economic crisis effect?) but the staff are super friendly and I got a great card for my friends graduation."
3,"I got the Gold Standard, he got the Longhorn. They were pricey dogs with minimal toppings. These are no Buldogis dogs...look it up and go there now and get one! You won't regret it. \nThey were edible and satisfied our hunger but I wouldn't go any further. Las Vegas Pinks is below them, so they have something going for them. Staff was helpful and pleasant. We expected high prices...it's the strip.  I say skip it unless your a hot dog fiend."
3,"RESULT: The parent company Frias resolved my issue. They took the time to research and find the cab and driver using our credit card information. They did a full investigation and although I don't know if the driver got reprimanded, they were very diligent in the follow up process. I guess I would take an Ace Cab again, but next time I'll double check to be sure I don't leave anything behind.\n\nEDITED: Below is my initial post. One day after posting I was contacted by the parent company and they are looking into the situation. I appreciate their effort and I will let everyone know if anything comes of it.\n\nORIGINAL POST: Driver was rude and a thief!!! We left our ipad in the car and so I left a message on their lost and found number and never got a response. However, we got a call today from a guy who bought the ipad from the taxi driver. Sounds like a scam, but no matter how it went down the driver did NOT turn in the ipad and the company never got back to me. I understand Ace is one of many cab companies ran by one parent company. I would (& will) avoid them all if this is how they conduct business. At least follow up. I realize it's difficult to monitor all the drivers, but at least pretend to care."
3,"TIP:  use their free wifi here (very spotty though)\n\ni only fly southwest here at McCarran, and the layout is very disjointed.  I can't say for other airlines but southwest has two areas with available gates.  So if you went to the wrong gate (or wanted to visit a friend from the other gate) , and that gate happens to be on the side, you have to pretty much run to the other side of the airport.  Also, the rental car center have to be shuttled (wastes time).  There is also one rental car company that is not even in the rental center (i think it's fox).  Do not rent from them!! they are far away, which is a waste of time.  Rentals in LV are cheap anyways."
3,"We had dinner here this past week based on all the good reviews. Our food was good but not outstanding. We had duck, steak and salmon entrees. The duck was probably the best and the steak was fair at best. The cheese plate appetizer was excellent. Service was very good. We will give this place another try before making a final judgement."
3,"Pretty good food, but a bit overpriced. Roasted duck appetizer was disappointing; dry meat and zero crisp to the skin. Sweet and Sour Pork was very good, and the coconut rice was awesome. I want to eat that every day.  But $30, incl. tip, is a bit much IMHO.\n\nWill return for the coconut rice and pair it with the satay next time, and will add an update at that time."
3,"I ordered brisket with nacho fries with outlaw burger. Ordered before my cousin and he got only the outlaw burger with Mac, and he got his order first. And I look across of me and I see a guy that ordered his food after me, and he got the same exact burger before they got my order. \nSo I ask the waiter why he got the burger before me when I ordered before him, and he just simply said that yours is coming up, playing it off knowing that he messed up. \nSo after 10 mins later they bring my food, but I only  got my fries no burger. Waiter said its coming right out. \nAfter another 10 mins I finally get it. Was kind of hard to enjoy my food. But nevertheless fries were good and the burger was just as good. And the price for all the food was just. I would of given 4 stars if they didn't mess up my order and not try to play it off that it wasn't the waiters fault.\nDon't get me wrong I would definitely come back again and hopefully get better service."
3,"I pretty much come here with large parties (the tables allow for huge groups) or when I just can't make my mind up on what I feel like eating because this place has a little bit of everything. \n\nI've tried quite a few different things on the menu and it has all been pretty good. Nothing spectacular, but not disappointing either. The Chicken Madeira and the Farfalle w/ Chicken and Roasted Garlic (tell them to hold some of the garlic) are among my favorites.\n\nAnd the cheesecake is always good. Lots of different varieties. Snickers, turtle, tuxedo, strawberry, etc. They are all good. But I've never met a piece of cheesecake I didn't devour."
3,"Not impressed with dinner at Davio.  Service can make or break a dining experience and I have to admit, I felt as though I was eating at Eat 'N Park.  The food was ok, but not on par with other similar restaurants.  The server was unprofessional and had no idea what was on the menu, or how to answer questions regarding it.  Do not waste your time, spend a few more dollars and go to Arlecchino or Alla Familia."
3,"Visited 5/8/12...\n\nCame across this location in travel while looking for a something a little different for lunch.  I think this is pretty new. \n\nIt is located on same building as gas station at Northeast corner of Southern and Higley. \n\nI only wanted something simple. Ordered Gyro and Fries.  Did it as take out. At 12:15 p.m. there was only one other person there eating.  Not sure if that says something or maybe they just have not been discovered yet. \n\nIt tasted good. However, I have had a better at some other locations.  I was disappointed in portion.  Three pieces meat, two slices tomato.  For a quick lunch it was satisfying.\n\nI looked at menu and saw some interesting items on menu.  Might be interested in trying these at some point later. \n\nIt is a nice option to other fast food.  Not a place that I would go out of my way for, at least at point.  But would definitely return for a Gyro if in the area. \n\nWill try back again in a month or so and see if they are still up and running.  Difficult location and visibility from street.."
3,"I stayed three nights in Paris. I requested a room with King bed. They gave me room with two queen beds. Next day, there was availability and they moved me to a room with King bed. Queen size bed was very uncomfortable. King size was not bad. Rooms were very clean. Bathrooms were clean, wide, functional. Check in was fast, although there was a big line. What I really liked about bathrooms were they had closed cabin shower and a separate bath tub. TV was basic, some good channels. It was very quite, had no noise problem. Hotel location is awesome, at the center of everywhere. Elevators worked really fast. My view was back, looked towards airport. I also used their spa company, wrote separate review for it. Paris has good restaurants inside. I also recommend going top of Eiffel Tower, view was spectacular. Monorail metro is also very close, you do not need to leave hotel to get to metro, very convenient. My only problem was that they did not let me use spa the day I checked out, which was disappointing. Overall good place to stay."
3,"Came here for dinner a few days after my first visit.\n\nThe nice looks of the place started to feel misleading pretty quickly.\n\nThe booze pours are super stingy. Both the beer and the wine glassware was modern and nice to look at, but the volume of liquid they were filled with made me feel like I was getting shafted by the bar tender.\n\nTo eat, we got the Louisiana Chicken pasta dish and the Bibimbap.\n\nThe Louisiana Chicken pasta tasted great and, in all seriousness, probably checked in at 2,000-3,000 calories. A significantly heavier meal than a double cheeseburger and fries at Five Guys. It was a huge bowl of heavy whipping cream and melted cheese, with some pasta for texture. The whole time I was eating it, I felt like the waitress should have been wearing a vest with flair pins and saying \""Welcome to Applebees!\"" Totally not what I expected to be served in a restaurant like Miga.\n\nThe Bibimbap was super sexy looking, but left everything to be desired on the eating side of things. It was missing the most important component of that famous dish - the dolsot, or hot stone bowl. It tasted only okay. Bottom line is that it was closer to a cold salad than any Bibimbap I've ever had.\n\nI'm sure I'll come here again, but I'll give the menu some time to work itself out."
3,"Distrito is pretty good, but not memorable.   It  lacks the energy you would expect given all the hype.   Plus the decor was underwhelming.   Too dark and lounge-like.  Boring really.\n\nWe started with guac and chips and salsa.   Chips were way over salted, almost inedible.  But I did eat them, found myself brushing off the loads of salt with my fingers.  Guac and salsa were good.  Then we moved on to veggie tacos which were nice and a kind of mexican flatbread with mushrooms and a huitlacoche sauce.   Also good.  The rice with corn, cream and habeneros, a kind of Mexican risotto could have been good if it weren't so over salted.  \n\nDistrito offers a nice variety of margaritas.  We tried the watermelon- cucumber and the cilanto and both were good.\n\nWe had heard that the service can be a nightmare, but we received good, if bland, service.  \n\nSo Distrito was an OK choice for us, but we are not pining to return."
3,The food is tasty. But the fact that they don't take credit cards and that coffee refills are not free will keep me from going to this place very often.
3,"I have been to Aunt Chilada's a few times in my Arizona days. \n\nThe most memorable, however, was when one of my friends and I pulled a Little Mermaid and combed our hair with plastic forks before dining here. and i believe we combed our hair with a fork shortly after making a hillbilly joke. ironic :) I don't remember why we looked so horrible but we obviously thought it was bad enough to need to comb our hair with a fork. \n\n\nanyway, the food here has never been memorable or terrible. more like a 'i won't complain if you let me sit on the patio and drink margaritas' \n\nit is definitely a 'meh' experience, but not gross....and probably the best mexican restaurant option if you're in that area. so for that, i am giving it 1 extra star."
3,"We sampled several items on the menu.  The pork sliders were great, the mushroom  burger was great --- and cooked to a perfect medium rare as ordered.  The fries were also quite good with a perfect crunch.  We did not really like the mashed potatoes because the potatoes tasted old.  The biggest disappointment was the buttermilk fried chicken.  Though it was fried to perfection and crispy, it had no flavor--completely devoid of flavor.  If celebrity chef Aaron Sanchez really did create their menu/recipes, he forgot to taste the one he provided for the fried chicken, as no salt was included in this recipe.  Unless the staff forgot it...."
3,"I don't know how to review this place.....I have been coming here for years and honestly it was great but I have not been crazy about it lately...everyone try's to be Italian host,waiters bussboy...but they are all Eastern European which is fine but speak English instead of butchering the Italian language.  I have tried most of the menu in the past, my favorite is the veal ouso bucco everything else is borderline chain restaurant quality....however if you get a table in the outdoor veranda you will likely not even know the food is just ok because the obeisance is terrific. I still would recommend this place but if you have good Italian food in your area you will not be Impressed.  Not the best in Vegas but worth trying at least once."
3,"There are days where I want a nicely prepared meal. And then there are days where I want to stuff my face at a buffet. Our friends chose Bouchon for brunch because we were itching for the former.\n\nI tried a small piece of the sourdough waffles with fresh strawberries and vanilla bean butter. It was very tasty, like a fried waffle. The vanilla bean butter was a nice touch.\n\nThe vanilla bean yogurt with granola was tasty, and boy do they give you a LOT of granola! A bit too rich for my taste, but the granola helped ease it.\n\nThe Cobb salad - didn't take a picture, but it was kinda meh. Limp iceberg lettuce, scarce pieces of chicken, and a small portion to boot for a $17 salad.\n\nThis is a good stop for some carb-loading for any pre-intense-cardio on the dance floor at a club later in the evening. The service is great and our waters were constantly filled.\n\nPrice-wise, it's high for a mediocre meal at The Venetian hotel. I think I'll stop by Grand Luxe the next time around, as their menu contains better choices. Not recommended for those looking for healthy options - everything tasted very rich and heavy."
3,"I have been to tgi only twice so far. The first time I ordered the filled potato skin appetizer. The portion was big and It could have been great if it had a sauce or something but it was just way too dry. \n\nAnd the second time I ordered their Caribbean chicken sandwich with \""Caribbean\"" sauce. The sauce was so disgusting I had to send the entire sandwich back. I couldn't even believe they seriously considered that sauce. So the sandwich was grilled chicken breast (very good) with tomatoes, avocados (still sounds good, right?) and then this sauce, which tasted like Christmas and pumpkin pie!??? It definitely had cinnamon and cloves in it... on a chicken avocado sandwich??? Like seriously? That is not Caribbean! Please if you are a staff from TGI Fridays and you are reading this, please take that sauce off of your menu, it is NOT good and my husband and mother in law who tried it, 100% agreed with me. Well, I sent back my food and ordered the turkey burger. It tasted not bad but I couldn't really enjoy it because everybody else was done eating and I felt stressed out. \n\nPositive was definitely the service though. Always friendly and professional. And they didn't charge me for the first order."
3,"Fun, casual place to eat with your friends. If you're looking for authentic Southern barbeque, move along, but if you want to chow down on some good cheap ribs and chicken, Bar-B-Barn fits the bill. \n\nWe came here hoping to watch the hockey game (well, the guys wanted to watch the hockey game, and we girls were wanting a place that wasn't filled with drunk hockey lunatics) while eating dinner. No TV, so no dice, but the homey barn-y environment still made for a fun night. \n\nGood cheap ribs. The meat was pretty tender. Sweet sticky sauce. Mmmm. I got the small portion with three ribs and fries and that filled me up."
3,"I took my adorable wife here on a tapas date before a late showing at the Manor Theater across the street. \n\nWe had some strong cocktails, including a delicious ginger cooler with so much real ginger! We shared a variety of tiny plates, little spring rolls and puffs of taro. The veggie offerings were all delicious, although there were not too many to chose from. Actually, I think that is a blessing in disguise because too many choices among delicious little tapas makes for some tough decision making. \n\nThe atmosphere was elegant, the lighting was romantic, and the staff was attentive without being intrusive. We held hands over the table, and played footsie underneath, and ambled into the warm summer night satisfied with our food & drink. \n\nThe prices are pretentious, like the presentation, but it's difficult to say it's not justified with the atmosphere & attention to detail. It's something I need to drop cash on like, once a year."
3,"Our server had a hard time believing that our party was older than 21 (we are all 24 and 25, mind you) and gave us quite the run-around with checking IDs.\n\nAfter that throwback to my freshman year of college, we put in an order for a few rolls. None of them really wowed us, sadly - Lava (a \""special\"" roll that could have been a lot more special), Dragon (best of the batch), veggie (for the lone ranger who didn't eat meat, yet surprisingly good), and tempura shrimp (tasteless!).\n\nThe edamame was good, but how can you really mess that up?\n\nThe best part of the meal was the cheesecake for dessert which came with two sauces, raspberry and dark chocolate.\n\nProbably a good date place, if you beat the crowds. And their servers are attractive, probably should mention that :-)\n\nAll in all there are much better sushi joints, I just know it."
3,Awesome place with great happy hour prices. Large clean rooms.  But they try to over charge.  And they ask for tip....what's up with that.
3,"It was \""ok\"" there wasn't much of a selection and it was a little high priced! i might try this again. The server was very nice but wasn't very attentive."
3,"My wife and I heard a lot about Freddy's and decided to give it a try. On our arrival the dinning room was busy adding to my anticipation.\n\nI ordered the #1 which is Freddy's original double burger with cheese. When it arrived I was disappointed with the portion.  Where's the beef! Although the burger was flavorful the patties were similarly sized as cold cuts. There was way more bun than burger.\n\nFreddy's is a good choice and I would return if I was on the area. However, with that said I would not drive out of my way as I was disappointed."
3,"Beautiful view at North Show Terrace .... kind of makes the $16 margarita worth it.  \n\nKind of.  \n\nAlso, the misters are a great idea in theory when it's 106 outside, but they aren't so great when the water starts trickling off the umbrella and onto your head."
3,Limited menu (mainly noodles and dumplings); reasonable prices; fast food service; this place is usually packed during lunch/ dinner hours because price is right and food tastes great! I had a bowl of pork feet noodle soup here on a cold winter night so the hot noodles was especially delicious to me! Portion size was just good.  Service was accommodating; the servers were very busy but still trying to accommodate everybody by getting the people seated and bringing the foods out ASAP. Good job!
3,"I'm a bit shocked that the reviews on this place are so high.  I do believe I am picky when it comes to comedy but I just was okay with this place and the show that was put on.  The seats are quite uncomfortable, old fashion, gold theater style seats.  The show is interactive which made it fun in some ways and bad in others.  (I wasn't familiar with things like World of Warcraft that were thrown out as suggestions from the audience.)\n\nI would say I was bored more often then laughing.  The skits were drawn out to much at times.  I don't think I will bother to go back.  It is nice that it is so kid friendly though."
3,"Place is alright. The blizzards are really good, especially the Oreo one. I also love the French fries here. The service in the drive thru can be annoyingly slow sometimes but it's worth the wait when craving ice cream late at night."
3,"Good food, nice atmosphere. A little pricey for the food (lunch), but good. Service was good, not too crowded. Would come back!"
3,"Grabbed a cab and headed over to Del Friscos arriving to find a dated kinda worn feel to it. Not comparable to a classy Chicago Steakhouse but more of a casual comes as you are feel,  The martini was well prepared and the portion was nice.\n\nI am one for aesthetics and the first one that grabbed me was that the salad fork is the same size as the dinner fork. Call me weird, but I like big man sized utensils  for $50 dollar steaks. \n\nNow about that crab appetizer.  Being from the wine country, I know I am spoiled but if a big hunk crab mixed with a monstrous amount of Old Bay is your thing, you have come to the right place.  I will eat crab served with cardboard I like it so much, but truly just so so.\n\nNext was the Wedge salad with blue cheese. This dish can be great when done right but if the lettuce is wet and leaking, the dressing and everything else turns mushy and bland.\n\nBut, drums please, the steak shines.  There I was with my miniature fork drinking some great cab and enjoying the heck out of my tender flavorful steak with some pretty tasty corn, spinach and mashed potatoes. (Yes I did order three sides.)\n\nSo maybe skip everything else and have a steak.\n\nGreat bartender was very well versed in the wine offerings and made the night a fun one."
3,"I was walking on the strip and thinking which club to visit. A Bank representative outside Bellagio was handing out \""free entrance\"" wrist bands, so I decided to give a try. Turns out it's not free, you still need to pay $20 (reduced price I was told) but you get a free drink. Line was not too long so I was in within 5 minutes. Used coat-check but they charge $5 (better pay than not lose it). I went to bar straight and presented my free-drink coupon, bar tender told my options, I picked one, it was an okay drink. I enjoyed my drink while watching gogo dancers and other girls dancing and partying. GoGo dancers were okay, beautiful but they barely showed some good moves, beautiful though, an friendly because people got pic with them. Girls in the club were beautiful. Did not get chance to dance but enjoyed the music, it was mix dance music and speakers were just loud enough. dance floor looked decent size. They also have VIP area for private parties. I might repeat."
3,"I've been to both Terminals in one day, and it's a nightmare sometimes.\n\nTerminal 1: For all domestic flights. \n\nParking:\n\nCovered parking is nice in the parking garage.. but they removed the coin-meter parking, & I MISS IT!!\nWell, at least we can pay with card now.\n\nCleanliness:\n\nIt's clean, sometimes. Not spotless, but hey, it's airport.\n\nService(s):\n\nThe information desk employees are friendly, and atleast they know what they're doing.\n\nThe signs for departure/arrival are pretty easy to read on nice LCD screens.\n\nI wish there signs for where which escalator flights would be coming down from instead of asking attendants on the floor. \n\nIf you can avoid it, don't schedule flights arrival/departure on Fridays & Weekends. The airport is packed.\n\n\n\nTerminal 2: International flights & Hawaii.\n\nThe signs for Terminal 2 are easy to miss. \nI hope they can make it easier to access and find. Maybe even just a big TERMINAL 2 sign.\n\nParking:\n\nNo covered parking here, but the parking rates are the same as Terminal 1.\n\nCleanliness:\n\nIt's a mess in there. It looks dirty, and it feels dirty. If you have to stay long for any reason, remember to carry antibacterial.\n\nService(s):\n\nThere are only 4 carousels for luggage. This isn't bad in my opinion. It makes it easier to find your stuff if anything.\n\nKeep an eye on your belongings, it feels pretty \""ghetto\"" in Terminal 2."
3,"While the meal I had was authentic and fresh (more onions than I'd like), I had to settle for the menu item because there are NO SUBSTITUTIONS. I am a diner who believes I should get exactly what I want when ordering at a restaurant because I'm using my hard earned money to pay for it. Romeos believes his dishes are created to absolute perfection and any deviation from this would ruin the taste of the dish. That is fine, but I didn't find perfection with the menu so I will probably not return for a meal. However, the desserts are delectable. Amazing selection. If I return it will be for dessert only."
3,"Sigh. I really wanted to like this show. There were aspects of it that I did like but I didnt leave thinking \""wow that was so good!\"" or \""that was worth the $$\"" and I didnt even pay! \n\nThe first part of the show, all you see is holly's back. -__-'' But no worries her boobies will come out later. \n\nOverall, I really liked the Green pole dancer. The chosen guy was really awkward cute n__n  Most of the girls surprisingly had real boobs. I've never seen so many boobies in my life. \n\nI suggest just waiting for discount tickets the night of or before the show. We watched it Christmas weekend and the row in front of us was completely empty."
3,"I'm not really sure how to rate Kung Fu Tea, because it looks like a wonderful and hip boba addition to Vegas. However, our teas left a little to be desired. I think I would rate 3 stars for the actual drinks, 5 stars for the tea quality, and 5 stars for the service = 3.5 stars overall. \n\nWe had the milk black tea and milk oolong tea. We chose 70% sugar, so it was not very sweet. I felt like that took away from being able to taste the flavor or the tea, because the drink tasted more diluted. I would definitely recommend just doing normal sugar, since their drinks are not too sweet. \n\nThe tea leaves taste of high quality. Perhaps too high for us... the oolong is very woodsy and smoky, so you definitely have to really like oolong. The black tea has bergamot oil in it, so it tastes more floral. I thought it was nice, but my friend and bf thought it tasted soapy. My bf went back to the store and told them that he didn't like the taste, and they generously offered to make him something else. It was extremely nice that they were accommodating to personal preference. That alone will get me back to try some other teas next time I'm back in Vegas!"
3,"The best place to go for a mid-day pick me up. I love their banana Nutella one. It's not too sweet, just right. You can also try their smoothies, which are the same price as the Beaver Tails (probably a better deal 'cause you get actual fruits instead of sugar)."
3,"I've been gunnin' for a Mongolian stir fry in the QC for a long, long time. I have great memories of heading to a similar style of restaurant when I was a wee girl. So, it wasn't too much of a surprise that I was jacked when I read that we now have a Genghis Grill in Charlotte! \n\nThe Good: \nAs others have said, you really make your own meal here. As in - if you don't love the components, well, it's your fault. There are a ton of topping options - proteins, starches, veggies, sauces, spices, etc. The instruction from the staff is definitely on point and helpful as you navigate the bowl bar. Overall, I liked my bowl and was able to make it super spicy with plenty of dragon sauce, jalapeno and red pepper. My mouth was on fuego. Plus, prices are pretty affordable at $8.99 for a lunch bowl and $9.99 for a dinner bowl. The kiddos will love this place. \n\nThe Meh: \nIt's a chainy chain, so I didn't really find much character in the restaurant. While the service was great, I really didn't have a desire to stay any longer than I needed to. Plus, the quality of the proteins was definitely lacking for me...the shrimp are incredibly tiny and quite a bit of my steak was a bit grisly. \n\nWould I head back to Genghis Gril? Surely. You have the opportunity to make a healthy meal that's quick and pretty affordable. It's absolutely A-OK in my book."
3,"We came to phat phranks for some Mexican food, more like a 3.5 star restaurant. We ordered the huevos rancheros, breakfast burrito and some flautas. The huevos rancheros came with either red or green sauce, I picked green because it has pork in the sauce. The dish was really greasy for my taste, the beans, eggs and the fried chips were swimming in grease. It wasn't a traditional huevos rancheros. The fried potatoes were delicious And the dish was okay, just too greasy. The flautas were crispy and tasty with fresh guacamole. The service was good.\n\nI had to give it 3.5 stars due to the greasy meal and also, we were charged for tap water. I'm not sure if that is a Vegas thing, but it was a bit unusual for me to see that."
3,Played here on 11/26/05\nCourse was in great shape. Greens were slow. Some amazing views and some not so amazing views on the course. Great course for ladies as their tees only play to 4400. Good value for 100 bucks not quite as challenging as Wildfire.
3,"Visiting town from Colorado, my friend and I love Hawaiian restaurants. Moki's was good. Nice menu selection. Got the chicken katsu and short ribs. Pretty good. Ribs were a little tough, and the katsu sauce was t great. A little pricey also."
3,"It's a hassle to get served if you don't have a reservation.  The bar area is packed and you really have to move fast to score a place to sit.\n\nThat being said, the swedish meatballs were excellent!"
3,Affordable eatery and the food tastes pretty good too. Changs Spicy Chicken is pretty good though the Hot and Sour soup could go easy on the sodium. Dimly lit interior fits in with the whole vibe and style of cuisine. Pretty friendly waiting staff and the service is above average. Lots of drinks to choose from. PF Changs is a nice establishment to venture to every few months.
3,"First visit and I had a drip coffee and the tuna sandwich. Both were excellent. Sandwich though was borderline pricey @ $8.  Service was efficient and prompt. Ambiance was nothing special and had a very much starbucks feel. \n\nOverall impressions: not bad, not great"
3,So let's start with 5 stars....well they lose a star just on service.   When I was there this afternoon there was only one other customer.   From the time I ordered to the time I received my food. ..15 minutes...a car pulled up behind me and eventually pulled over and the couple walked inside.  Another star lost due the food  being very heavy on the salt.   However on the plus side the man who took my order was very polite and made sure my order was correct and that I had all my extras condiments.   This place was first known via Food Network's Diners DriveIns and Dives....well this location is a dive. So that is factored in as well. Evidently they filmed at the Decatur St location.   My Pastrami Burger was as delicious as advertised.   The highlight however were the garlic fries.  Absolutely awesome!!  They are thin but moist and flavorful. .....Overall I will go back to try again but maybe try the other location.   It is also rather expensive but you do get a lot of food. ......
3,"My biggest complaint is that the restaurant was FREEZING!!! I realize it's winter, but the AC was on inside. \nThe pico and guac were delicious! I also got the fish tacos which were great. The ceviche wasn't what we expected... Not bad though. \nI wouldn't go out of my way to come here to eat, but I would come back again."
3,"As a gambling lover, I always love coming to vegas.  I've been to many casinos in northern california such as red hawk, cache creek, thunder valley, and even one in redding called win-river casino.  I have never been asked if I wanted a massage while playing cards until today at a pai gow table.  We had a full table and the player on the right of me accepted the massage offer from the worker, which then turned the player's chair around and put a giant cushion in front of him to relax on.  During the game, the massager was going all out on the player beside me.  After ten minutes, the massager told the player that it was $20 and if he wanted to continue for more.  Pretty sweet deal if you ask me.  \n\nAs far as their cocktail waitresses, they rarely ever came by to serve us drinks.  I'd say they came by once every 2 hours.  Overall, I'd go back for sure some day to gamble.\n\nThree stars for being an average casino that was good, but nothing stood out from the hotel to me except for the massage therapist."
3,"Loud\nCash only\nBoobs\nLoud\nGet ready to stand a lot\nGood, no, great music\nLoud\nGirls dance on bar\nBartenders are funny bitches\nLoud\n\nAll in all, a pretty fun bar, but this lilly white blonde girl who likes color felt pretty uncomfortable around all the rough bikers dressed in black leather.  I felt judged."
3,i was just driving by to my hotel and one of my friends spotted this place on the side of the road so we went and tested it out i didnt get fries but my buddy said it was a terrible choice and wishes he got fried zuchini instead which was outstanding by the way it was so good i had the farmers omelete it was so good and the hash browns were so good i had way to much food def had the itis afterwards and passed out food was delicious though
3,"Cute spot. Good food.\n\nThe only thing I wanted from Eat was not available--the beignets!! Ugh. My heart was crushed to learn they didn't have any :( Alas, I opted for a chicken sandwich and it was good; nothing too special. The service was okay and given how small the menu is, I expect the staff to know the ingredients of the menu items which wasn't the case.\n\nWould I return? Only If I happened to be in the area but wouldn't be my first choice."
3,"if you're into heavy, rich food, Cowboy Ciao is your place.  i wasn't thoroughly impressed with the food, but the service is good.  very welcoming hostess, if i do say so myself.\n\nhonestly, i'd rather walk around the corner to fnb - it's way better."
3,"This is one of the many MGM-Mirage properties on the strip.  The casino and hotel staff are all welcoming and friendly.   The casino floor and selection of shops and eateries is  decent and complete.\n\nThe casino floor and shops are all looking very nice with the New York theme design and  layout (Obviously very well maintained). The hotel rooms, however, are starting to look a little dated and might be due for updating (My room had a tube TV, which seems like a ancient relic now in 2009 - especially for a large, reputable, mid-strip property)."
3,"The lady at the front is really rude. I've never been so upset. We ordered 7 orders of dumplings to-go (70 dumplings) they shortened us and only gave us 50 thinking we wouldn't count them. Not only did they gypped us, they were rude about it. They gave it to us, with it leaking all over the bag, and when we asked for an extra bag, she smacked her lips and gave us a dirty look. \nI'm like what?? On top of that, they gave us 2 dipping sauce for \""SEVENTY\"" dumplings when normally you'd get one for every 10. \nI'm just really disappointed at the service. \nBesides their horrible service, the food is really good. \nLol I enjoyed the food a lot. Wish we had what we ordered but yeah it was really good. \nThere's a nice waitress there, she's the younger one and she was super sweet to us and gave us extra sauce."
3,Very gorgeous hotel but restaurants are a little too expensive for a locals place. The shows are good there yellow brick road and steel panther. The pool is great but last Saturday they kicked us out at 4 to host a wedding and rushed us out and I had a tab running.
3,"I think I was a victim of over-hyped burgers.\nThere was nothing bad about \""the burger,\"" and it was good, but there wasn't nothing particularly mind-blowing, either.  \nThe quality of the meat was very good, and my burger was cooked fine; however, I appreciate a well-seasoned burger with a lot of flavor more than just good meat.  I actually had to put a tiny dash of salt on the burger to help it out.  \n\nThe side salad I got instead of homefries was small but good, with excellent dressing.  My date ordered a grilled chicken sandwich that was good, but, again, no seasoning.  \n\nI recommend you try Tessaro's at least once, but don't go in with lofty expectations."
3,"Dinner here was really, really OK.  No, I mean it.  Absolutely adequate.  It won't hurt you at all.  You might not remember it, though.  The atmosphere is absolutely present.  Also, the service happens."
3,"La Place Dupuis est en quelque sorte un fant\u00f4me. Aujourd'hui convertie en un centre commercial associ\u00e9 \u00e0 un h\u00f4tel et \u00e0 une tour \u00e0 bureaux, elle n'a pas vraiment de personnalit\u00e9 et vit en quelque sorte dans l'ombre de la vocation premi\u00e8re de cet \u00e9difice. En effet, la Place Dupuis occupe une place importante dans l'histoire du Qu\u00e9bec, puisqu'on y trouvait jusque dans les ann\u00e9es 1970 la grande surface Dupuis et fr\u00e8res, une sorte de Wal-Mart fond\u00e9e et exploit\u00e9e par une famille de Canadiens fran\u00e7ais. Si vous faites des recherches dans les archives des quotidiens existants et disparus de Montr\u00e9al, vous allez d\u00e9couvrir que le plus important annonceur \u00e9tait le plus souvent Dupuis et fr\u00e8res, dont les sp\u00e9ciaux s'\u00e9talaient le plus souvent sur plusieurs pages. Cet \u00e9tablissement fond\u00e9 au 19e si\u00e8cle n'\u00e9tait pas seulement un grand magasin tr\u00e8s populaire, mais \u00e9tait en quelque sorte un symbole de r\u00e9ussite pour les Canadiens fran\u00e7ais. Aujourd'hui, on y trouve surtout des comptoirs de restauration rapide, tr\u00e8s populaires aupr\u00e8s des employ\u00e9s de la tour \u00e0 bureaux et des \u00e9tudiants de l'UQAM, qui y mangent le midi. On y trouve \u00e9galement plusieurs d\u00e9taillants, dont un Bureau en gros, mais je ne crois pas qu'il s'agit d'une destination de magasinage pour qui que ce soit. On passe par la Place Dupuis, qui est connect\u00e9e au m\u00e9tro Berri-UQAM, et on y fait des achats en passant s'il y a lieu, mais sans plus."
3,"We stopped in again for a chocolate concrete which comes with one add on, in this case toasted coconut which did nothing for the shake.  A great shake, but I am glad we decided to share since it was very filling."
3,"I love my chinese food - so I always jump at the chance to go and review a chinese restaurant. We chose this place because of its excellent happy hour deal; something which seems to be amiss throughout the area's chinese restaurants. However, even without the happy hour deals, I would venture this place is a pretty low budget night out as it is. This is reflected in the quality and taste of the food - its not the best I have ever had, and one of my dining companions questioned what type of meat was in his dish more than once. However, as I mentioned, this place is cheap, and you get what you pay for - something not to great, but filling and cheap."
3,"We came here for dinner with my boyfriend's family. They come here often and it was my first time. The prices are good for big portions. I came in with an empty stomach and left fully satisfied.\n\nIt's not the nicest place, but for what we ordered it was good. I got walnut shrimp and wonton noodle soup. The shrimp was good and tasty. Crunchy where needed. The broth to the soup however had no taste and the noodles were kinda hard. My boyfriend ordered duck and basically ate the whole thing. He really liked it. It was good but I've tasted tastier duck at Sam Woo. The sweet and sour soup was just as named. And the crispy noodles were thin and crispy. \n\nThe customer service was good. They were nice and accommodating and continuously cleaning our table off because we did order a lot and it got pretty messy. They were also filling up waters constantly so no problem there. \n\nTheir bathrooms were okay. And there was a cart full of dirty dishes by our table, I wasn't so sure about that. But they did clean it out every so often. Didn't really bother us but I was just wondering if that was supposed to go there in the first place. \n\nAffordable for the whole family."
3,"As I have said many times I love Italian. When I ended up at near by Best Western I looked up the best rated restaurant on Yelp that was nearby. I ended up at the small Restaurant Foccaccio. It was Italian but it wasn't up to the quality I have had in other restaurants. My biggest complaint was the Parmesan cheese. When i eat Italian I like fresh Parmesan, not something out of a bottle. Food was tasty, but portions were a little on the small side. I would eat here again, but if you are looking for an above average mom and pop Italian restaurant, this isn't it."
3,"I would definitely stay here again. I wasn't expecting luxury by any means but I also wasn't expecting it to be as decent as it was. We needed a last minute place to stay and booked a room for that night for $50. You get what you pay for, and those that complain about how grungy it was should have known that when they booked it. It is pretty far off the strip, but not nearly as far as Hard Rock. They sell $1.50 Bud Lights at the bar inside which is always a plus. I joined the Owl Club to get the $200 free slot play. I didn't win anything but I didn't lose anything either. The people that worked the counter were friendly and accommodating. The room was clean and had a television, what more can you ask for? Like I said, I definitely would stay here again when I was looking for a cheap hotel option in Vegas.\n\nOh and just a warning, the walls are REALLY thin and you can hear pretty much everything going on in the room next to you. If you are going to Vegas for a quiet experience you are in the wrong place anyways.\n\nAlso, DO NOT go to the Hooters inside the hotel. Its absolutely awful. (see my other review)"
3,"This place has potential to be a fun place to hang out.  Good staff, a stage and games for entertainment, a roach coach on the side that makes decent food-the potential for a fun neighborhood hangout is there.  The Living Social deal was well worth it to check the place out and sample their beers."
3,"I came here last night with a friend for dinner and received average service.. Our waitress was very nice and prompt. +1  The margaritas were way way too sour and basically tasted like slurpees.  I ordered the Bleu Cheese Chopped Salad (in which the cheese is made from vegetable enzymes and is imported from Denmark, containing no dairy which was nice +2) and it was very filling. The side of potatoes were very good as well.  I will most likely be returning."
3,"It was ok. I went for weekday brunch and Wynn paid half of the meal. There was nothing terrible and nothing exceptional. If you have a sweet tooth, I think wicked spoon has better selections."
3,"Wine list is ok, not what I would have expected for a Wine Spectator award winner, and the markup is ENORMOUS. Generally the fish menu is sustainable but when I commented to the waitress about the CRITICALLY ENDANGERED Chilean sea bass she didn't even know the difference between farmed and wild caught fish let alone what sustainable meant - wait staff needs to be trained on that. Quality and flavor of the dinners was great overall, but the risotto side dish had zero flavor - where's the salt?? Beautiful view but in my opinion NOT totally worth $100 per person for dinner...and that didn't even include an appetizer or dessert!"
3,"4 years! That is how long they have been open. As I walked in, the place was empty with two women sitting on the chairs talking. I didn't have to wait and was ushered into the set previously occupied by my threader. After a few quick questions on whether I have ever had this done before she sanitized her hands and my brows. \n\nWhen she got to work, she was all business. Roll, grab a wide section, and pull. I was afraid that I would not have anything left with all the ripping sounds. It took me by surprise because my first experience was near painless. This time, I jumped in shock. It was an amplified cleaning that I did not expect. When I came out, my friend said I looked like I was stuck in a state of perpetual surprise. The good, I have two brows with a distinct shape, a light brush and clip at end was also nice. I was in and out in a matter of 10-15 minutes. \n\nI liked my previous experience a little more since it was more natural. The bottoms were left,  just cleaned up and not sculpted giving me a fuller look. The work done was precise and that should be commended. I will have to be a little more vocal next time. For $10, it is standard to most other threading salons."
3,"I tried the regular coffee. Average. Haven't tried the flavors like the other folks have so I will be looking for some \"" must have \"" suggestions! \nAverage cup of Joe, but.. that said the staff is awesome and gets my morning going. I am not a morning person but on my way into school they totally get me ready for people interaction or... maybe that is the caffeine. Well, I like the staff so I say its them. Will be going back and may just have to adjust the gold stars if I like what my fellow yelpers recommend!! Post those suggestions. \n\nOverly Caffinated and so loving it!"
3,"I'd been here a while back for a Yelp event so we headed here when we were looking for a place to chill rather than get onto a crowded Light Rail train. Extremely loud music and really, not all that good. But we had a couple of beers and managed to shout over the racket for a bit.\n\nIf you're planning a visit, I'd recommend avoiding the band. Why does it have to be so damn loud?"
3,"I was in Vegas last month and had heard about the incredible buffets, so I decided to give it a try. Everyone knows Caesar's is supposed to be the best but this place also had a great reputation. Key word is had. Don't get me wrong, there are still lots of good things about it. But there were also some things that could stand serious improvement. First of all, the meats were not good, kinda dry and just bleh. If you are charging this kind of money, you better have mouth watering prime rib and roast beef to start. Also, some of the side dishes were bland and uninspired. Yes, there was alot to choose from and the atmosphere was nice but for the price they are charging, they need to do more. The highlight of the meal was dessert. Creme Brulee was out of this world as were some of the pastries. The Crepe station knocked it out of the park. It was just sooo good. But the highlight of a pricey meal should not be dessert. The rest of the meal has to stand up on it's own and this just didn't. That being said, it was still better than some of the other major buffets on the strip. I should mention that the service could also stand improvement. Everytime I needed my waitress I could not find her. The dirty dishes piled up and I literally had to get up to get someone's attention. That should simply not be."
3,"First things first, I would never buy anything from Digger.\n\nThis is merely a matter of personal preference, not a personal vendetta.  I admire its sunshine coloured exterior, the quaint hanging decorations, handcrafted cards and eye-catching ornaments etc. It's just simply not my thing.\n\nThe appeal may be to mothers and daughters, they would love this 'twee' shop as my Mum would say."
3,"The steaks we had were disappointing for the price. We both order medium rare, my wife got a rare steak and I got medium. They argued that they we're cook correctly.  \n\nI have better steak at Outback, longhorn."
3,"When I lived in Vegas this was my go to spot for nutrition products, and now that I'm outside of Vegas I still stop in nearly every time I'm there.  Why?  Because the prices are the best I've been able to fine, anywhere.  I mean anywhere, even online.\n\nThey have a pretty good selection of nutrition products, anything from protein bar/powder to vitamins.  If you're in need of a nutrition product odds are they have it or something very similar.\n\nAs others have said the customer service is not too great.  You're more or less expected to know what you want before you come in.  Questions are often answered in one word responses or pointing to where something is.  Is it is what is is though, the prices are phenomenal so I can live with lack luster customer service."
3,"My third favorite steakhouse. They have the best blooming onion and green vegetable selections with brocolli, string beans, and asparagus. Texas Roadhouse edges them in the steak department. Outback also had the better mushrooms. Delfrisco's has the best steak with a steak called the Wygul but it is pricey. The front entrance position is a little weird to me. That's just my 2 cent."
3,"Visited here for the first time on 1/21/2012 with a Groupon!\n\nAtmosphere was nice, dark with lots of recessed lighting, you could definitely go casual or dress fancy and be in place with either. The service was really good, fairly quick to take your order and bring out plates. Plus, they had a waitress constantly refilling your glass of water (which can be a blessing at an Indian restaurant if you accidentally order something to spicy for your taste!)\n\nHalf of the menu was vegetarian, thumbs up for that!!\n\nI was impressed that they immediately bring out a complimentary plate of very thin flat bread and chutneys as soon as you're seated. We ordered the veg sampler appetizer, which was pretty good. I definitely preferred the paneer pakoras and cauliflower pakoras over the samosas. I ordered the malai kafta as my main course, good. Garlic naan and paneer bread were very impressive.\n\nI enjoyed Bombay Grille, but it doesn't top the quality of food at Woodlands... I'm forever spoiled."
3,"These sandwiches are delicious, but there is one problem....Why is it that only the fire department and police officers get a discount in Las Vegas? I am in private EMS, and even when in uniform I am told that there are no discounts for us. Police, Fire and EMS are a TEAM... we work together as public safety guardians! Please fix this error!"
3,"Was on our way to noodles of\nAsia for a 6:00pm lunch before our 11:30 dinner reservations at Raku (conventional dining time does not apply- it's Vegas!) but stumbled upon Pinot Brasserie, took a quick look at the menu and seemed harmless enough. $9.00 for a bowl of French onion soup and $15.00 for mussles&frites. \n\nFoodwise\nI'm already craving the mussels and it's only been an hour. The white wine+butter+garlic sauce was divine specially when you throw the frites in for\nA swim and find them couple minutes later. \nFrench onion -one of the better French onions I've had. Too many restaurants use salt to flavor the lack of\nOnion in their soups but at pinot you can taste the onion broth in the state it's suppose to be.(btw do NOT get the F.O at aria, see my review)\n\nFor dessert we got the roasted strawberry with vanilla and mint w/humbolt food cheese.- I'm not a fan of roasted fruit, it's too mushy and makes me think of the ones you try to avoid at the market. Besides that though the flavor\nCombination was awesome.\n\nOk, so foodwise everything was on point, service was a different story. The server was HORRIBlE. Whenever I thanked her for anything she just stared at me like wth? Didn't come around to check up on us. Kept trying to push dessert. I got better service from the busboy/girl. And fr a server that wasn't even ours. Learn to smile girl, and your tips will double."
3,"If you're looking for fabulous, go elsewhere. I've stayed a lot of places in Vegas and the MGM was rather disappointing. When I checked in, they had overbooked the large suite that I booked online, and offered to DOWNGRADE me to a room half the size. Are you kidding me?\n\nEverything from the rooms, to the casino, to the pool, to the service, is extremely mediocre and unmemorable. If you're spending the money to have a nice vacation I'd say take your business elsewhere."
3,"Still a solid three stars from me, which again needs to be put into context of what I enjoy from a bar and a night out. It's a proper pub-bar with a cheeky Australian theme. Postcards of boobs and bums above the bar, a sign saying \""dickhead\"" pointing to an empty space where an unsuspecting punter will stand, slightly sticky and dusty. Reminds me of a slightly better kept student union.\n\nBut the crowd are friendly, the bar staff fare no-nonsense friendly. There's one side of the bar that has a big sign saying NO SERVICE do not stand here. If you stand there, they'll be upset. If you don't, they'll be a-ok.\n\nThere's two pool tables though, and for me that's a total winner. Just take note of the method of getting a game (adding your name to the chalk board list). The players are friendly and just adding your name up means you'll probably get chatting to some interesting folk.\n\nStandard drinks (as in, no cocktails) for a bar. Good wee location. Inundated with Australians on Australia Day. Not too shabby."
3,"The most recent Vegas trip was the first time I got to eat in China town and I was excited to find out they had a ramen place. We arrived just in to time to beat the crowd. I went with a group of five and we got seated within 15 minutes. I ordered the \""screaming for vengeance\"" with corn because I love spicy ramen but was disappointed it wasn't spicy enough. I am still in search to find the most spiciest ramen. The broth was on the saltier side, I am not sure if its because I've been drinking and my taste were off. The broth was ok but I was disappointed that the food was not piping hot. However, the really like the pork belly, talk about fatty goodness. The noodles were cooked al dente and had a really nice texture. This place is a solid 3.5 stars in my books."
3,This place is pretty fun. The drinks are neat concoctions and pretty expensive. We went last night and got two entrees and two drinks. With a $20 off coupon it was still $60! But we have gone there before and it is a fun place to go in Vegas! The food was delicious and the staff was friendly
3,A ton of tea on offer and my raspberry hibiscus iced tea was brewed perfectly. I'd frequent this place if it were closer and not in the middle of Tempe Marketplace.\n\nLess stars because they were out of my first choice and the guy running the till went into an anti-Starbucks rant not knowing I was with a Starbucks manager. Have your opinions but it's not really something to start going off about in front of first-time (or really any) customers. You never know who's listening!
3,"OK. The owner contacted me and was rather disconcerted about my one star rating and review. He should genuine interest in ameliorating the problem and expressed thanks for my review information to help him do so. He seems to be an owner who really does care and doesn't just discount a review as \""some idiot out there\"" as many owners do. I raised the review from 1 to 3 stars because of his pro-activeness. He offered for me to come in when he was working to discuss the matter further. I will probably go back in again and amend the score if it warrants."
3,I work late somtimes and they are open rather late and do not mind if you show up 5 min before closing time. The food is better then the normal cheap chinese/asain type places. Ask for a suggestion and they will give it. \n\nChicken fried rice is my usual.
3,"A major drawback is the stale smell of the dining room.  My meal would probably have been a lot more enjoyable if I got to eat in the outdoor patio.\n\nIt's a good place, however, to take a mixed group - there's something for everyone - gyros and shwarmas for carnivores, Med platter (hummus, baba, tsaziki, tabouleh, falafel) for vegetarians.  Portions are generous - especially the lentil and rice side which was as big if not bigger than the mains.  Food hits the table fast and the prices are reasonable - no wonder this place is always packed."
3,"I work on the North Side and went for a walk to find something new for lunch.  I am quickly growing tired of Eco Bistro directly downstairs from my office at Allegheny Center.\n\nAt any rate, came across this place at the corner of Ohio and the onramp to 279.  The lunch special was inexpensive and grabbed a soda for about $6 in all.  I had the Kung Pao Chicken and it was prepared to order.  Tasty, cheap, fast.  I ate inside - there are only a handful of tables in this place and it's decently clean."
3,"This place has awesome ratings on both yelp and zagat, but i was so disappointed. My expectations must've been too high. I WILL give them props for having the *best* and most smooth Thai Iced Tea I've ever had in my life though. Onto their food? The waiter suggested their duck in red curry. The duck meat tasted a bit... expired.. and rotten. It was also rough, and the curry lacked in flavor. We also ordered a green curry with chicken, which wasn't bad, but it didn't amaze me. I've had much better green curry at any reg Thai joint back home in New York. Now... the appetizer that the waiter said we HAD to order was GROSS. It's some crispy rice sort of thing.. and it's sour, and sour, and sour, and also expired tasting. Why is it their most popular item? People in Vegas must be weird then, sorry guys. \n\nOh, the lady behind the bar area was also rude. She had a huge diamond on her finger and wasn't in a uniform, so she might be some kind of owner/manager. To me though, that means you should step it up a level and be even more nice, not be a snotface. Skinny face, medium long black hair, pale, slender asian woman with a big rock -- BEWARE OF HER, she will make your whole meal unpleasant."
3,"Casanova is a cute little Italian restaurant in the Venetian. Unfortunately, I didn't know how small it was. I had a table reservation for 13 people and was seated outside the actual restaurant which was really the middle of the walkway of the Grand Canal Shoppes. It was extremely loud, especially since there is a bar not 10 feet away. It's also right before the food court so there was a ton of food traffic throughout dinner. I would definitely reccommend this place if you were in a small group, up to 4 at the most. They would most likely seat you inside where it is very adorably decorated.\n\nFor an Italian restaurant at The Venetian, the food was extremely affordable. I got the Timballo which is basically penne in a creamy pesto sauce baked with parmesan on top. It was so flavorful and very filling; I wasn't able to finish my plate. The bread they serve you is so good too and delightfully roasted and warm. \n\nIf you want good Italian at a reasonable cost, I definitely suggest Casanova."
3,"Very busy store. Sometimes long lines but it usually goes pretty quick. Some of the stuff they have is a pretty good deal, 99cents sometimes 2/99cents! Not the biggest 99 cent store in town but it's close. \nThere's still something's I refuse to buy at these stores because I don't know where it comes from or how it was handled. The store can be messy too.\nI usually go in hoping to get something in particular but end up spending at least 5-10$ on other thing I suddenly decided I really needed"
3,"Due to location (convenience factor) I decided to check out Beijing instead of my usual fave Ho Ho Cherry House.\n\nI ordered the Sesame chicken (extra crispy) and was pleasantly surprised that for 8 and change you receive a generous portion of chicken, fried rice, egg roll, choice of soup - I went won-ton, and even a little steamed broccoli. Ho ho cherry house doesn't offer soup or broccoli- so I was really pleased.\n\nMy order took only 10 minutes - and it tasted cook-to-order. \n\nI really enjoyed their egg-roll's - definitely better than Ho-Ho's.They use more than just cabbage which is key. The rice was tasty- and the soup was awesome! I actually gave some to the girls that I was babysitting and lets say Ive never seen a 4 year old  down won-ton soup broth versus the chocolate ice cream in front of her! \n\nWhere they fell off the wagon was the crispiness factor. Unfortunately, that is kind of my main test for Chinese and the chicken just wasn't crispy at all. I would hate to see what it would be like if I didn't order extra crispy- it would have been mush! I also didn't care for the sauce as much as Ho-Ho's.\n\nThe sides were all cooked so well- and you can't beat the price or the location so I think id try it again and really stress the EXTRA crispy part!"
3,"Overall good experience.  I had the slider trio with a side of jalapeno coleslaw. Was expecting the slaw to knock my socks off but was anything to write home about. Pulled pork wasn't my favorite texture seemed more like pork roast. But the hot link was fantastic! Very spicy!  I was very disappointed with the country berry cobbler, lacked sweetness entirely. The place packed & decor and atmosphere were real homey. Liked the personal touches with their murals. We'll definitely go back. Looking forward to trying the smoked meatloaf."
3,"A good friend of mine is a secret fan of gift shops- he can spend hours in them- so long as they are the official ones. Well this one is an official one and despite the twee gift ideas and corny souvenirs there are some more classier and elegant gift ideas in here. \n\nThe quality is also much better than the cheaper alternatives on the Royal mile, minus the bad and loud music and bright colours the later ones have. \nSo it really depends on your budget and how much you want to hunt around for gifts or souvenirs. I like the service in the gift shop- the lady is always so nice and didn't mind my friend browsing for an age either. (and didn't follow us around like a certain other cheaper gift shop did). If you payed to get into the Castle might as well have a walk around even if you do choose the cheaper options down the street."
3,"Letzte Woche war ich mit einer Freundin dort essen.\nParken ist mit Gl\u00fcck dort in der N\u00e4he m\u00f6glich, Hausparkpl\u00e4tze oder so gibt es nicht.\nDer erste Eindruck beim Eintreten war, dass es wunderbar nach Gew\u00fcrzen duftete. \nDer Zweite, dass es dort alles ganz sch\u00f6n eng gestellt ist. F\u00fcr mich als dickem Menschen leicht beengend. Wir hatten dann aber einen Tisch, wo ich nicht allzusehr im Weg sa\u00df und das war ok. \nDas Lokal ist ebenerdig zu betreten, so dass es, mit einer kleinen Einschr\u00e4nkung f\u00fcr gehbehinderte Menschen geeignet ist. F\u00fcr Rollifahrer schon etwas eng. Im Lokal selber gibt es Pl\u00e4tze, die \u00fcber eine Stufe h\u00f6her angelegt sind.\n\nDie Bedienung war nett und freundlich, das Essen frisch, lecker und schnell da (wobei es recht voll war). \nWie \""indisch\"" das Essen ist, kann ich nicht bewerten, da ich noch nie in Indien war. Auf jeden Fall fand ich es lecker, besonders das Gericht meiner Freundin und das Eis. Der Salat war eher unspektakul\u00e4r.\nAls Dessert hatte ich hausgemachtes Mandel- und Cashew-Eis probiert, dies war echt toll, da es ganz ungew\u00f6hnlich mit Kardamon gew\u00fcrzt war und ein wahres Geschmackserlebnis.\nDen Toilettenbereich kann ich nicht kommentieren und bewerten, da ich ihn nicht genutzt habe.\nOb Kartenzahlung m\u00f6glich ist, wei\u00df ich nicht."
3,"The decor and atmosphere of this place is awesome and that's what initially attracted me to in while staying in Caesar's. Cool fish tank, nice decor. Everyone is dressed in all white and the entire restaurant is decorated in white. I tried a beef and noodle dish which was just okay, lacking any real flavor. I was really hoping for more and since it's Vegas it was pricey. I think my bill was somewhere about $35 for my meal and a beer."
3,"I like the atmosphere , it seems familiar but it's not . \n\nWe tried the lunch special that was an open faced green chili meatloaf sandwich and the grilled salmon salad . Both dishes came out pretty as a picture with the food stacked high .\n\nThe meatloaf sandwich had mashed potatoes over the bread and a tasty cole slaw on top of the meatloaf . Unfortunately the potatoes were very over mixed and were extremely gummy .\n\nThe salmon salad overall was good and I am not sure if I didn't like the chive risotto cake or maybe the flavor of it clashed with the citrus dressing .\n\nService was fine .\n\nI would come back again but I am not in a hurry ."
3,"I had 40 mins to kill and the place was packed, so I was worried about how quick service was based on other reviews.\n\nI snagged a tabled, within 5 mins I had a drink, and even though I was quoted 20 mins on buffalo wings, I got them in under 10. \n\nService overall was great.\n\nThe wings were vinegary, and they had the heat, but I wouldn't get them again. Two guys next to me got the fish and chips and they said they were good. \n\nAlso, food is priced well, but 9$ for a 22oz Stella? Yikes!"
3,"Although I wasn't ecstatic about the food, the service was good. The guy who served us was very accommodating to our needs. Honestly, I don't think I can even give a proper review because I'm a vegetarian. Being named Mr.Tofu, I wrongly assumed that there would be some veggie dishes. To my dismay, there was 1. It was a cold tofu noodle soup. It literally had 3 ingredients. There was noodles, tofu broth (which I'm guessing was made from tofu juice), and ice. It tasted like tofu, which is bland without incorporating any outside elements. I had to eat kimchee with the soup in order to taste anything. The side dishes were good because they added flavor to my meal. I probably won't stop by unless I go back to eating meat."
3,"Can someone tell me why these are so posh?  Name? Comfort? Style?  \n\nBecause my opinion only is that they don't look comfortable, and the style is very old looking, not for someone in their 20's.  But maybe I'm wrong, and it I am, for all you lovers, half the store was 50% off as of last week!!"
3,"5 stars for the concept itself (bringing a cupcake store to Scottsdale) and the bright airy store environment. I am totally not a big fan of sweet so maybe my overall rating is a bit biased, but I've had cupcakes at Magnolia (NY) and absolutely loved every single bite.  Sprinkle's, however, didn't really strike me in the same way. I thought they were extremely overtly sweet =/\n\nOne other thing when we were sharing a red velvet, the top came off ! WTH?!"
3,"Interesting food creations, using lobster in sandwiches, salad, fried food, and ice cream!  However, the foods in fact tasted just A-OK and prices were sorta steep.  $23 for a 6\"" lobster roll was pricey, I think.  The lobster salad came with lots of small chunks of lobster meat and was good for the price.  Lobster bisque was just standard.  Lobster-n-chips was cool though! Beer-battered and fried lobster huh? Yummmmm~  Last but not least, the lobster ice cream that sounded out of the ordinary was actually vanilla ice cream with itsy-bitsy lobster meat.  The ice cream tasted alright but was worth a try!  Just ask for a free sample before you buy, so as to make sure that you would like some savory ice cream that tastes like seafood. *wink*"
3,Located inside the Tuscany Casino where we stayed while in Vegas for a convention.\n\nOur party of ten came for dinner.  Plenty of seating for large groups.  Our server was very patient and didn't get frazzled when we all wanted to use our 2 for 1 dinner entree coupon.\n\nFood was decent.  Prices decent.  Portion size decent.
3,Nothing off the charts but not bad for a simple lunch or dinner or to meet up with some friends.
3,"If you like carne asada, I mean if you really like carne asada, this place is definitely worth checking out. If you like a variety to choose from, maybe not.\n\nThe menu is a little limited with the main dishes being carne asada taco, burrito, tostada (Vampiro) and quesadilla. They do have one vegetarian dish and, of course, chips and salsa.\n\nNow for the good news. The carne asada is pretty good. I tried the Vampiro and the quesadilla. Both were very tasty. Some people have mentioned that the chips and salsa are extra, but most counter service places I've been to charge for chips and salsa. It's worth it. The chips are fresh and the salsa is not particularly hot but has a great flavor.\n\nIt's definitely worth a try, especially if you like carne asada."
3,"This review is only for eyebrow waxing.\n\nWalked in on a Saturday afternoon and within 5 minutes I was taken to the back. No waiting. My normal eyebrow place is a 30 minute drive across town and there's always a one hour wait just for eyebrow waxing. This place is conveniently down the street from me. \n\nI'm used to more plucking than waxing. Here I got a lot of waxing, almost no plucking. My eyebrows ended up much thinner than expected, not everyone can work with my brows, but I still took the risk. I was a bit disappointed at how thin they turned out. It's been almost a week and so far, not a hair in sight which is good. Pricing is reasonable, $10. If I'm ever in a jam again and need my eyebrows waxed stat, I'd most likely visit again. They do accept cards but want gratuity in cash."
3,"Went in on a Sunday for the first time. They are opened till midnight, which is great. The sushi, nothing special. I give it 3 starts b/c their edamame is not organic (per waitress), nor is their soy sauce. I don't know about you guys but I have zero interest feeding myself genetically modified soybeans. Wish they would make the change to organic/non-GMO verified soy, but then again why would they? Majority of the people don't care or have knowledge of what GMOs are ~ so, I guess for the minority of the public it wouldn't be worth to change that *SIGH* one day we will all care -_-"
3,"I chose Mesa Grill after hearing Delmonico's is way overrated. Having eaten at the Bahamas location, and despite my aversion to Bobby Flay, I decided to give the Las Vegas MG a try.\n\n1. Awkward seating arrangement: We had a table of six, and it seemed like they had to put a table in the middle of a seating arrangement in order to fit us. We would've been perfectly fine if the wait staff wasn't continually bumping into my friends' chairs and then asking them to move out the way. That was uncool.\n\n2. Food was great. Everyone was really happy with their dishes. Amongst the six of us, we ordered the duck, ribeye and pork tenderloins. For sides, pesto mashed potatoes, baby carrots, tiger shrimp tamale and sauteed spinach. We had to wait a bit for a couple of the sides because the waitress forgot them, but it wasn't too bad. Food came out hot and tasty.\n\n3. Desserts were okay. I enjoyed my spicy chocolate creme brulee in the Bahamas more than the profiteroles I had. I thought they were really stingy with the iced cream which put me off a bit.\n\n4. Service was alright. Our waitress was chatty and came around a few times to check on us.\n\nMesa Grill Las Vegas didn't disappoint and I wouldn't be against visiting BF's other restaurants."
3,"Out with the old. In with the new. FINALLY, the Target (read Tarjhay, in case ur not in the know, and if ur not, what cave have u been living in?)...on Camelback and 7th Ave. is going Super Store at  nearby location. Happy about the remodel and upgrade. Not so happy at the SUPER store status. I'm NOT into the super/great/mega store deal. I want specific places to get my specific goods. Like when I'm grocery shopping I'm not looking for lawn chairs, end tables and Arizona souviner T-shirts. I\""m looking for boneless, skinless chicken breasts, overpriced olive oil a 6 pack discount on a Bonny Doon wine deal. Meanwhile this Target is (purposefully) running out of things and is short on amiable, clever responses to the inevidable question of their reopening."
3,"I ordered friend noodles to take home. Some how the instructions wasn't clear or mis-interpreted about the level of chili in it. I was just excited to go home after a day of sweated heat in Phoenix.  I got home and the sauce looked lava red. I ate about a third of the dish, and I wish I didn't eat any. My lip was swelling and face sweating.  I drank down a coca cola bottle to control the convection going inside me.\n\nSome how, you need to check the level of pepper spice on these take home orders. I will give them another chance as this is just one dish (and not about pallet of dishes ), and to explain themselve, and I will be happy to update my rating. This is not an experience to be repeated."
3,"I want to love this place. But, I just can't.  I felt like they were a mediocre burger place with a great beer list.\n\nWhen I walked in, I just stood there. As a first time patron, I had no idea that I was supposed to seat myself. There is no giving you an indication of this \""seat yourself\"" policy. I found a table, but it had no menus. At first I did not find this strange until I realized that all of the other tables had menus. When you re set a table, ensuring it has menus is important. \n\nI ordered the bruschetta and pesto burger which was delicious!  However, the size?  5 oz. for $7.59 with no size. There was nothing about this burger that made up for the price. It was tasty but small. Sides are extra. The options are fresh cut fries, shoe string fries or sweet potato fries. After you add a side of fries to a burger, you are looking at a $10 meal. That is a little crazy for what you get.\n\nMy dinner companion ordered the mac and cheese with bacon burger. The components were delicious (of course I sneaked a bite), but the burger itself was not great as a whole. It was dry. Maybe a cheese sauce would have helped?  \n\nThe beer menu is HUGE. There are a ton of great brews to try but otherwise, this place is just ok."
3,I shop here all the time.  Staff is friendly and helpful.  But .......the bathroom is always NASTY.  I always question if I should shop there when the bathroom is always disgusting. Yucky
3,"Pretty good sports bar located across from the sports book in the MGM. So cool place to go and grab a beer and some food after making your bet.  The place gets packed on Saturdays and Sundays during the football season so you might have trouble grabbing a table if you're with a big group.  There appeared to be a good amount of seating at the bar if you can get in there early.\n\nFood is basic bar food, I wouldn't get anything other than wings or perhaps a burger, anything else would be a waste in my opinion. They have some decent deals during game day, I went with the shot and beer combos. Nice variety of beer on taps and most of your classic domestics in a bottle.\n\nNothing overly special but a nice place to chill and enjoy the games on the numerous TVs."
3,"Green river soda pop, fried mushrooms, and all of the typical Chicago favorites such as Red Hots and other miscellaneous hot dogs are served up here.  I lean towards fried appetizers at places like this and they were just alright.  Service was somewhat slow and I miss the old pizza place that was in this location beforehand."
3,"This Dunkin Donuts is one of the first to open around the Madison area.  It's located on the corner of Hwy Q and Hwy 19 in Waunakee, and is attached to the BP Gas Station that's on that same corner.  \n\nThe staff was super friendly and helpful, the donuts were decent.  If you're in the area and craving a donut, give these guys a shot."
3,"fun spot, pretty good food-not crazy authentic but definitely still worthy of a meal or two here-and the service was good.  Very casual laid back but I loved the tortilla soup :) Don't come in looking to be wow'd by the service but they did fine in my book, it's so casual so I don't understand why everyone was so eerked about the service."
3,"Pluses: great location to be close to The Strip but pay off-strip prices (5/10 minute walk to Ballys/Paris), Westin Heavenly Bed & Heavenly Shower, nice if u want to rest away from the city's hustle & bustle, plenty of free parking\n\nMinuses: Small pool, small spa (it's nice but doesn't have all of the amenities that you'd find at a big spa), surprised they didn't have iHomes in the room\n\nAlso I was disappointed with some of the customer service. We wanted to leave our bags with the bellhop because our room wasn't ready yet. He wasn't there but the concierge and all 4 of the people at the check in desk weren't doing anything. I know they saw us waiting! It was so long before someone even acknowledged us that I was literally seconds from putting my bags back in my car! Even if it's not your job, you should at least say \""he'll be right back\"" or \""let me find him\"". Or even better, help us yourself! How hard is it to put a ticket on a bag! That was so uncalled for... Disappointing"
3,"This Motel 6 is a-ok with me. It was inexpensive (and this was dead of summer we were talking about here). The room was clean. The staff was friendly. I slept through my wake up call, but that's my fault. They got a little pool to the side. Plenty of parking.\n\nThe only issue I'd warn you about is that this is next to some sort of theme park. This can create some noise in the day. You can't really see it from this facility but it is there. You'll hear it. There's also not a lot around this area, so getting up and getting breakfast is a pain because you usually have to go drive somewhere."
3,"Not too bad. Selection of cake batter, vanilla, and chocolate are all good. Pretty good selection of toppings. Make sure you ask for mochi! The interior is splendid with lots of interesting people. Some Indian mom asked me how per hour do I charge ( I was wearing a rent by the hour shirt)...still awkward...."
3,"I have lived in the area forever and never been here, so I decided it was time. \n\nOkay, the view, we get it. IT'S LOVELY... and quite perfect. I really do love the view, but the other reviews definitely cover this part:]. \n\nThe restaurant is very elegant, cozy, and spacious enough to have your own conversation without someone eavesdropping. \n\nMy favorite part about Ventano's is the staff. They were all super friendly and kept my water glass full (my favorite) and made sure everything was up to par. As for the food, I felt it was mediocre. The bread served before the meal was not as I expected. They seemed like pre-made (wannabe) fresh bread sticks, but they give you oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping, I'm not sure if I should be feeling this confusion with bread and dipping... but I associate oil and vinegar with fresh bread. \n\nFor an entree I got a pesto dish, which.. Yes, was good.. but I still feel it was average. My friend got another pasta dish with spicy marinara which he enjoyed. We also indulged in dessert.. tiramisu. Enjoyed this as well. \n\nVentano's is good. Nothing more, nothing less. I enjoyed my experience here, and food was definitely a step above an Olive Garden. I will be back on the occasion."
3,"I'm glad that someone else mentioned that this was known as the Kabob House, because if they didn't, I'd never have found it.  I don't know that I've ever seen it called Khaneh Kabob (though perhaps that's what it says in their native tongue).\n\nAnyway - the place is indeed clean, though in an odd twist, it's attached to a beverage store.  That's not bad, just a statement of fact.  If you order a kabob that contains steak or chicken, I can definitely see how you might be disappointed - you don't get a lot.\n\nIf you order a kabob that has ground meat, you'll probably have leftovers.  Unfortunately, I can't tell you which kind to order, because we always go with our friends who do the ordering for us, but I can definitely tell you that these are not your typical Americanized shish-kabobs.  These are Persian-style kabobs.  So don't be disappointed.\n\nThe ground-beef-style ones are wrapped around a long, flat skewer and cooked on the skewer, and you get a ton of meat.  I don't know if you have to order side dishes separately, but we always get them - rice, bread and other items - because the meat by itself is good, but you'll want to have other items as well, because it makes it so much better.\n\nService is friendly, but it isn't speedy, and they have not historically been able to communicate particularly well in English."
3,"Came here during the Christmas week, so there was a premium price on the buffet during lunchtime, about $30-something per person. The regular line up to get in was PACKED, so if it wasn't for the line pass we had, it would've been bye bye to the buffet.\n\nBeen here before last year and it seems the quality has gone down. The food was okay, but there really wasn't anything to write home about. They have your standard stuff that can be found in other buffets like shrimps, prime rib, roasted chicken, etc etc. They also have the king crab legs which seem to be the main attraction as I saw many people just having piles and piles of them on their plates. I didn't try the king crab legs as I'm not fond of them in general. I found many of the food to be kinda dry and so I have to put a lot of sauce on them to taste better.\n\nThe best part I found was the dessert. They have different kinds of dessert from creme brulee to creampuffs to different flavors of ice cream, as well as brownies, banana fosters, and cookies. I tried the creme brulee and cookies and they're pretty good. Better than the main stuff honestly.\n\nPop and juice are included in the price, so try to take advantage of that.\n\nNot worth the $30-something for lunch, but ok for the regular $20-something."
3,"Went there with a group of people. the portions where huge! Half of us liked the food, and the other half just thought it was OK. The jerk pork and chicken weren't that tasty. But the pork BBQ was great, as were the sweet potatoes and rice."
3,Went the other night with a big group from work and had a really great kobe burger with white cheddar and sweet potato fries. The burger was cooked perfectly and the fries were kick-ass. Still not the best burger I've ever had but we had a great time!
3,Alright sushi. At least they have a few good roles for $5 ish. Good and quick for a pick-up lunch during the work week.\n\nNo seating. Takeout/Pick up only.
3,"Personally nothing to write home about here.... Every time I go in, it does satisfy my need for a good sandwich that is different then your usual sandwich shops. Below is what I like:\n\n-Large selection of soups\n\n-Decent sandwiches\n\n-Ice Cream\n\nPersonally, I won't go out of my way for Jason's Deli but then again, I also won't avoid it if I am passing by or meeting friends here."
3,Good food. I liked the Chicken Marsala but the prices could be better. There is a kid working their that looks like Jonah Hill/Seth from Super Bad - with a white boy fro and all! That made only OK service a little better!
3,This place could be 5 stars if it changed a few things.  The menu is ok and my food came out tasteing pretty good.  The ambiance is awsome.  Love the indoor out door set up.  You can even bring your dog onto the patio.  The bartenders all seem really pretentious.  The owner should send them over to Ve Bene in Ahwatukee to see how a good bartender interacts with their patrons. They don't offer any drink specials at night and drinking there can get pricey.  I guess that's why they are always pretty slow when I drive by.  Maybe they think they are keeping out the riff raff. ;o)
3,"The first time I went here, I got the shredded beef burrito ($6.29) and thought it was just ok (it was HUGE).  However, I LOVED their warm chips ($.99) and guacamole ($2.69)!  \n\nAlthough I've revisited this location, I haven't tried anything else off their menu...I just run in for an order of chips and guacamole.  My mouth is watering just thinking about the lightly salted chips and tangy guac.\n\nBTW, although I prefer Qdoba's chips, for burritos, I prefer Baja Fresh.  As others have mentioned, Qdoba is just like Chipotle.  It's even located across the street from Chipotle...go figure."
3,"It was good. It wasn't outrageously great, but it wasn't horrendously bad. \n\nI ordered the Turkey & Rosemary Omelet and my boyfriend ordered the French Toast Strata. \n\nMy meal came with an omelet, oven-roasted potatoes and fresh fruit. While everything was good, I have to say that I probably could have made the meal at home. If I go back, I wouldn't not eat this again, but I would definitely like to try something from their lunch selection first. My boyfriend was pretty much in agreement there. While he said his meal was good, he wants to try their burgers. \n\nThey have a nice size menu filled with lots of veggie and lean meat dishes, which are perfect for me. However, they also cater to my boyfriend's style with such dishes like the Wisconsin Pride Burger (cheese curds and bacon on top of a 1/2 lb burger). \n\nWe actually went their for breakfast for my boyfriends birthday. With that in mind, we left with a cupcake (I passed; too full to even think about cupcakes). My boyfriend chose the carrot cupcake with cream cheese frosting and walnut bits sprinkled on top. He wolfed it down and said it was good. \n\nI may update this review after we go for lunch sometime."
3,"We decided to start our Winter Break with pizza!  We had a coupon to try Florencia's. \n\nWe got there just before 3pm and had the place to ourselves, but for two other tables. \n\nMelissa greeted us at the door and grabbed our drinks super quick. We ordered the XL Cheese pizza, we were all craving cheese!  The pizza looked great and tasted as good as it looked!\n\nThree stars due to the fact that we had to get our second round from the bar on our own. We won't let that stop us from trying Florencia's again. The pizza was cheesy and full of flavor, the crust...perfect!"
3,Its just okay even with the low price. I stayed there during the Mining convention and it seemed understaffed. The room was clean and the water hot.  Its okay.
3,"Sometimes it pays to be in larger groups when the bill will be larger and provide bigger tips.  \n\nMy wife and I seemed to be overlooked, especially towards the end of the meal.  Took 16 minutes to order dessert.  Way too long.\n\nThe ravioli was great and pork belly was tender.  Ther prawns were a little over done.  I would try going here again to see what happens.  I was not going to cause a scene, but by the end, I was just trying to get out of there.  The food was a 4, but the service seemed slow."
3,"Surprisingly decent venue- larger than expected, back wall is a massive bar. Lines for drinks get long, and prices are predictably steep for generic draft beer, but the staff are friendly. In addition to bartenders, there are a lot of people cleaning and monitoring the crowd, which is a nice touch.\n\nBathrooms are huge with 20+ stalls, so getting in a trip between sets isn't a huge wait as it is at other venues. The acoustics are fairly good, but I found it odd that the general admission/floor area is divided up by odd iron rails- I understand they don't want a giant mosh pit going or anything, it's an unusual setup."
3,I have gone here a handful of times in the 5 years I have lived in copa and most times it was horrible the food was dry and tasted like it had been sitting on the counter in back for hours ...but in my most recent visits it seems to have improved greatly. Hope it stays that way....
3,"Little pricey for the food.  The reason it pays to come to this place is the excellent drink menu, and souvenir cups, glasses, mugs, etc. that you can take with you.  The place is packed with movie trivia and buy stuff in the store next-door.\nNice stuff for lunch during the convention...and creates a good memory!"
3,"Having had memorable meals at Kai, we were thrilled to learn of its former chef joining partnership here at Mod.   Signature touches and flair were apparent in the presentation, the food was innovative and some of it was excellent, such as the \""shroom\"" dish.  The venison lollipops were too rare for me, but my husband said they were tasty.  He also had the pescado loco tar tare, and found it to his liking. I ordered the duck large plate and was disappointed-duck was good, but dish featuring beans, rice, okra, etc. was no better than say one would get at Milagro Grill or The Mission. The okra was unusually salty.  A server came to our table with a covered dish and asked if it were ours.  We inquired as to to what it was. He didn't know. He had come from the kitchen; not a regular waiter, but totally clueless. I do understand it was Labor Day Weekend and staff may have been not the usual crew. Our waitress was very pleasant, the hostess welcoming, and the others we encountered were attentive. Loud music for a younger crowd was intrusive. I could see going again for appetizers and a cocktail, but would not go back for dinner, considering the myriad of choices available here in the Valley."
3,"As a local and former Detroiter, I was excited to get a little taste of \""home\"".  Valet is only open to hotel guests and the parking garage is a joke.  The first 7 floors are reserved for valet?!?!?  Then you drive up and up and up only to have the garage just end with no logical way out.  Went there specifically to eat at American Coney Island.  It was OK, but they are kind of chinzy on the chili for their coneys.  Some Vernors would have sealed this as a Detroit coney island.  Walked around the casino, but thought the dancing table girls were tacky and the music was ridiculously loud.  Nice try, poor execution"
3,"We had a stopover in Phoenix and ended up at Jose Roux. I ordered steak tacos and ice water. The menu said that rice and beans were $4 extra, total, so I decided to pass.\n\nThe tortillas were absolutely delicious--homemade, corn, soft. Unfortunately, they were really, really tiny. There was lots of stuff piled onto the taco: steak, lettuce, tomato, salsa. The menu said the steak said it was marinated with pineapple but I couldn't really taste any of it. The steak was pretty tough. The mild salsa was good, though. Black beans and tasteless white rice were on the plate, though I didn't order them; the waiter didn't charge me, though.\n\nService was really slow, which is a little irritating at an airport, but a common problem nevertheless."
3,"I'd give Bei a 3.5. Who ever the Yelpers are that compare it to Shin Bay, have obviously never been to Shin Bay. Not even close to Hiro, for that matter. We're talking Ra or Kona Grill at best. \n\nFor shame fellow Yelpers, let's just call a spade, a spade. It's passable sushi in Scottsdale. \n\nFor those who disagree...get out more. Try real sushi."
3,"C'est un peu mieux que ce que c'\u00e9tait il y a deux ans. Premi\u00e8rement pour moi l'exp\u00e9rience varie principalement avec les compagnies a\u00e9riennes. Qatar Airways c'est le check-in le plus vite que j'n'ai jamais eut de ma vie. Sans blague, 30 minutes j'avais pass\u00e9 le check-in des bagages, les douanes. Je me sentais comme un VIP! Air Canada il y a deux ans, oufff c'\u00e9tait dans le m\u00e9diocre absolu. 1h20 pour le check-in des bagages. 10 minutes les douanes...\n\nMaintenant, le hic que tout le monde ont eut c'est la ligne d'attente stupide avec le beau Welcome to Canada ( et l\u00e0 dans ta t\u00eate, t'as l'impression qu'il manque le monde IDIOTS \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9) parce que c'est longggggg.

3,"Food is great. Grilled salmon burrito is awesome! Customer service, very friendly and 'above and beyond.'  I was surprised how unhygienic and gross the men's bathroom was; like a smelly truck stop."
3,"So I went back again after probably 3 years, due to a hankering for Greek food since I was in the area. This time, I ordered their Spanakopita to see if the recipe has changed. The presentation was exactly the same but this time, it tasted great! The pastry was flaky and it had the right amount of saltiness. It looked kind of like a spinach lasagna. It was over a bed of rice pilaf. I did not care for the rice, it was lacking flavor and moisture. I also ordered their pumpkin cheesecake. Way too sweet. Even sweeter than the ones I order at the Cheesecake Factory. I would say 3.5 stars this time around."
3,"Food was ok. Meat was blah, fries were blah, but a fun experience. \n*If you weigh more then 350 you eat free. \n*They only accept cash.\n*must wear gown and bracelet\nWouldn't come back because the food was nothing special, but a good experience!"
3,"Sichuan is a region in China known for hot babes. If you know a thing or two about what brings the heat you know that you need the whole package. Pretty and smart gets it done. Taking one without the other you're either shallow or a chump.\n\nYou'll see a ton of these yelp reviews deride the decor or the service or the atmosphere. These are the kinds of kids that like places like Imperial Garden. Who likes that place? (I do. Kind of a lot. I think?). You'll also see a ton of these yelp reviews glow over Sichuan food and eating stuff like oxtail and tripe or pickled soup. I am a big fan, and their spicy crispy chicken is my jam. The only thing I got here that I didn't like was the Kung Pao chicken - it didn't pack much heat and the sauce was thick and sweet. I think they thought I was getting something from the Americanized menu.\n\nSo what kind of babe is Ichiban? Obviously she's the brainy one that doesn't care what you think. I kinda wish she did, though."
3,"(Lyrics - Maroon 5 - Payphone)\n\nI'm at the Attic trying a burger\nAll of my taste I spent on you\nWhere have the times gone? Bo Bites, it's all good\nLet's go and make a reservation for two\n\nYeah, I, I know it's hard to remember\nThe reviews we used to make\nIt's even harder to take a pic\nThat you're here eating next to me\n\nThe Attic is located upstairs in ... well the attic - wink.  Actually its just plain upstairs if you want me true opinion.  Came in on a Wednesday happy hour and apparently it's $10 burger and beer night!  Super awesome in my books.  \n\nThey serve mostly craft brews so I went with the Avery Karma, a pale ale from Boulder, CO.  The ale had a crisp hoppy taste.  For the burger I went with their special, a mushroom and swiss cheese burger.  Overall, it was okay since I didn't really care for mushrooms in general.  The burger was not as juicy as I would like it to be even though I ordered it medium.  The bun was probably my favorite part.  Nice and toasty, but soft in the inside.  \n\nService was okay, except I would appreciate more smile I guess.  In the end, I think I would definitely return to the attic for it's atmosphere.  It had a sports bar lounge ambiance with a classic view. - Enjoy!"
3,"Grab decent sandwiches and gyros, and enjoy live music if it's scheduled.  I was addicted as a student and still enjoy stopping in when I visit C-U, but it's a simple joint.  Right on campus near the quad."
3,"Went here, not once, but TWICE, in one evening! \n\nWhy, you ask? My friends and I were hungry and this place was cheap, and their nachos didn't mess around. \n\nAt $16 a pop, the nachos was big enough to feed you, me, and everyone we know. The cheese could've been melted a little more, but it was still pretty good, especially when you're trashed. \n\nIf you need more alcohol in your system, scrounge up a couple of bucks, panhandle, get your \""Will dance for $\"" sign out, and get a $1 margarita. It's strong and sweet, and will keep your buzz going."
3,we told them we were on guestlist but they didnt seem to care.  then we all paid $20 including girls even though there was no one inline.  it turns out if you stay at the venetian you dont have to pay.  \n\ninside the club was pretty crowded though.  the booty shaking girls were pretty impressive and the ones massaging each other were too.  the buddhas all over the place were a bit creepy to me but i dont think others mind as much.\n\nthey make you walk all the way upstairs to where they usually have tao beach in the daytime.  it s a nice spot.  except for the ugly plastic covering some construction they have going on.  we sat on the couches but they wouldnt let us sit for long because they were bottle service couches.\n\ni think different rooms play different music.  it rains down foam in the main room which i think is yucky.  i was walking around with a drink and some girl bumped into me.  my straw went up my nose.  and it started bleeding.  then i coughed up the blood.  dont worry im ok.  ha
3,"Product:  One of the best meat quality in the Vegas area, variety of selection that cannot be gotten in other restaurants.  It is also very clean unlike other places around. \n\nService: It is only good if you speak Korean or sit in the same table with a person that speaks Korea, but i guess it is a common theme in all Korean restaurants around Vegas. \n\nPrice: A little high compared to other, but i would pay it for the quality of the product. \n\nOverall: If you can live with the poor service of a typical Korean restaurant, i would strongly recommend go there for the quality of the meats."
3,"This place is pretty silly but fun, I suppose - fake 'rustic' decor and staff dressed in what look like sack-cloth shirts. It's more of a cow byre look than a potting shed, though! \n\nIt's not somewhere I'd go all the time but it's in a good spot, and the food looks good."
3,"Oh, San Felipe's you sure did luck out by being right next to the stage at Tempe Marketplace.\n\nShowed up at 7 on a Sat. Yep, I just missed their happy hour. They weren't very crowded.\n\nShort line at the door for checking ID's. Have to wear a bracelet for 21+.\n\n\""Wait to be seated\"". So we wait, & then wait some more. The 2 girls lackadaisically wiping down menus don't say anything. We finally ask about the lack of a server & they finally want to put our name on a list. Gee thanks!\n\nWe sit at the bar & order drinks. Bam! The table we wanted on the patio is available. Yay!\n\nWe sit & wait. Wait. Wait. Server! Oh, this is the same girl who served us last time we were here.\n\nOk, basically you do a lot of waiting at this place. *sigh* Pathetic. It took FOREVER for my quesadilla to come. $4.95 for a small. Add $2 for chicken or steak & $3 for shrimp. It was decent. They didn't skimp on the chicken at least.\n\nThe heaters came on a little too soon. Got a little warm. Temp dropped & it became perfect. Heaters go off & stay off. Umm OK :(\n\nThere was no guy holding the men's restroom door open this time. I was so relieved, you have no idea.\n\nSo, why 3 stars this time? Free chips & bomb ass salsa. It's chunky & perfectly spicy with black eyed peas & corn. I want some in a bottle for my house please!"
3,Have eaten here a few times before & was very satisfied...UNTIL THIS VISIT service a little slow had to wait 30 mins. for our burgers which tasted OK but were very much on the small side..we ordered the relapse which is smaller size offered but both of them were about the size patty you would get from Micky Dees so for $9 All I got was a $3 burger. I may have to rethink this visit before we go back again. Because we really like the place. Great people but not burgers on this visit.
3,"Great food. We were there around 9 on the Sunday of a long weekend. They closed the kitchen while we were there. Also, the place is nice enough but I would not call it fancy. It's more of a family restaurant or a good weeknight option for couples."
3,"Watched Secret Life of Walter Mitty, the theater was ok. It reminded me of home in Stockton. It's quite small, but does the trick I suppose. The seats were not comfy and you have to 'look' up at the screen. It's really old fashion including the restroom. \n\nI guess if you have NOTHING else to do and want to see a movie, this is the place."
3,"First visit to the Church Brew Works and can safely say it left a lot to be desired.  Had the Oktoberfest and the IPA and the schnitzel for dinner.  The beers were average, as was the main course.  The ambiance is phenomenal though."
3,"They have a great happy hour, despite their not handing over the happy hour food menu unless you ask for it. \nIt's also highly recommended you don't bring your spouse to the same place you bring your girlfriend. \nThen things aren't quite so happy anymore.\n\nTry the Ginger Bourbon Lemonade. It'll sneak up on you like a gay cellmate.\nThree of these, an angry mistress I tried pawning off as an unpaid vendor, and a wife with a penchant for sharp cutlery doesn't make for a good happy hour, let alone happy anything.  \n\nThe Friends with Benefits sushi rolls (delicious) should have been a warning bad things were headed my way. \n\nWhatever type of drink my wife had smelled good on my clothes the next day.  I think it was apples or something. \n\nThe happy hour menu isn't fifty percent off anymore, but it is cheaper than the regular menu."
3,"While I reserve the right to upgrade this my gut is 3.5 stars rounded down Thanks yelp. \n\nService: \n5 stars, granted there were only us and 2 others for a short time. The staff was great and friendly. \n\nFood: \n2.5 Stars, I had a burger and knew that it was not going to be the best burger ever but decided to try it anyway. They Flat Grill (fry) a hand pattied 1/2lb burger and serve it with mayo, mustard, 1000 Island, let and tom. While it was not over cooked it was too thin to cook med rare. The flavor was ok but there was no seasoning at all on it. \nThe fries needed salt desperately also. \nThere was a small and I mean small cup of what appeared to be coleslaw.. wow it was bad. \n\nBuilding: \n3 Stars Clean open, plenty of light. Looked nice to me. \n\nI WILL be back for some breakfast."
3,"Great little brunch spot. All local and organic food. Service was friendly, atmosphere was a little lacking. Will definitely go back."
3,"The build your own burger concept is nothing new, but they do have some interesting toppings to put on as well as a variety of buns.  I ended up going for a 1/3 lb. brie (yes, brie.  One of the most underrated cheeses for hamburgers) and ham burger.  It was incredibly juicy and tasty.  \n\nThe down side however is that the food is rather expensive.  My hamburger ended up just shy of $10.   Toppings like bacon, ham, fried onions and mushrooms cost an extra $1 on top of their base price ($8 for a 1/3 burger).  A second cheese is also an extra $1.  The standard lettuce, tomato, onions and pickles uses up your 4 free toppings, so anything more you'll have to pay an extra 50 cents.   \n\nThen there's the $3 for a single serving of fries (although with the size of the burgers, you probably will want to split the fries.)   And there's the shakes, though delicious cost $5 which made me channel Vincent Vega from Pulp Fiction.\n\nSo, good food, but not worth the extra expense in my opinion."
3,"Nothing like waiting 10 minutes at the bar to get service. Nothing like watching the other bartender hit on three girls while you sit there, waiting for this unseen bartender to quench your thirst with a tasty man soda. Even worse, the other bartender won't help you because it's \""not his section, sorry.\"" So we got a table and told the hostess why we were going to take a table to get a couple of beers and an appetizer. She didn't seem to care.\n\nThe manager even walked by, looked at us, and kept walking. He talked to at least 2 tables around us but skipped us for some reason.\n\nWhat's really sad about this place is they have so much potential to be good and just fall flat. They have sooo many delicious beers and the staff doesn't know anything about beer.\n\nThis place apparently brews beer and has their own beer on tap but our server couldn't even sell us on trying it. He didn't know much about it. It sounded like he didn't know much about beer, which to me is bad if you have 30+ beers on tap and call yourself a pub.\n\nMy husband tried it and it was pretty decent; we were quite impressed but puzzled that the server couldn't tell us much about it.\n\nThe food was pretty good and didn't disappoint, but it did take a while to get it...\n\nWe probably won't be going back to this place again."
3,"For the bad, it's a 1 star. But also for the bad, it's a 5 star. So I'm splitting the difference and going with 3 stars.\n\nThe Sirens of TI is like the ugly Christmas sweater. It's ugly and awful. But it's also fun and the theme of hip holiday parties. The Sirens of TI is so bad, it's kinda awesome.\n\nIf you go into this free show expecting something amazing, you will be disappointed. But if you approach this show like an ugly Christmas sweater holiday party - if you relish in the badness of it - you will have a good time and understand its awesomeness. If you go with the right mindset, you just might laugh so hard that tears stream down your face.\n\nFor best viewing, catch an early show. Prior to the club officially opening for the night, the patio area of Christian Audigier is open - and there is no cover. Access it from the outside. It's a perfect view as you are sitting right alongside one of the pirate ships. And you can sit and have a drink, as opposed to stand in the crowd and get shoved by small children who should not be allowed to view this show."
3,"This place is never very busy, I LOVE THAT! And they have everything I need for my appliances and tool needs (when I'm not hanging out at that \""other\"" tool store). I also love that they carry the piece for my refrigerator so I can change the water filter myself (it makes me feel handy and domestic). The customer service is helpful without being pushy."
3,"I have been a fan of this place for a while. I have stayed here a few times throughout the years. I like the rooms, the only problem is the location of the casino from the strip. Although it is still super close walking distance. I love the 25cent wings after midnight. I like playing here as well. The only reason why I'm rating it a 3 star instead of a 4-5 star is because of the horrible rude staff there. Every single person I ran into that worked there had a horrible presence and talked to me like I wasn't worth there time. Which really made me mad. I'm a huge gambler and that made me just walk out the door."
3,"Make sure you sit downstairs. Upstairs is fine, but ambiance downstairs is 100 % better. Preferably a seat on the far left, view overlooks the lovely Pittsburgh downtown skyline. Service was great. I did enjoy the swordfish. Shrimp appetizer was not bad. Food a little cookie cutter boring."
3,"I called in a pasta order ahead.  I tried two dishes.  The chicken parm and one other dish.  The sauces were tasty but a bit on the salty side as the other reviews have mentioned.  AND I LOVE SALT!!\n\nI don't know what it was but the staff (owner and cook) were both very nice but for some reason I felt awkward in that place like I was an unexpected guest.  Then again, I'm a younger, sharper dressed, fine watch, imported car kind of American boy and this strip mall isn't in the part of town that makes you all warm and fuzzy inside.. It wasn't enough to turn me off but I did feel weird being in there.\n\nThe food was good overall with the exception of being really salty.  At least it isn't bland and has flavor.  \n\nI will surely give them another shot and try the pizza..."
3,"We ate there this past weekend and I the food was top notch.  The value for the dollar seems to be a bit lacking.  $10 for hummus was about 1/2 what it could/should have been.  It tasted wonderful but $10 was too steep.  The lamb shanks my wife ordered were $23 and again, great taste but quite expensive for what you got.  Apple Martini was $10 and a Stella Artois on tap was about the same.\n\nThe one thing I really didn't like was the very loud music.  Seemed to 80's and kind of affected the mood.  I almost felt I was shouting over the music.  The service was good and the food was very savory.  \n\nIf you are looking for something unique, this is definitely worth a consideration."
3,"Nicht schlecht, Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck von 8-0 Uhr, hab ich noch nie erlebt! Kosten: alle 4,90EUR mit Getr\u00e4nk einen Euro g\u00fcnstiger. (Allerdings der teuerste Kaffee des Lebens  3,90EUR f\u00fcr die gro\u00dfe Tasse stink normalen Kaffees) \nFr\u00fchst\u00fcck war gut, doch jeder Extrawunsch kostet auch extra (kein Tausch von Butter und Marmelade gegen eine Nutella m\u00f6glich).\nBedienung sehr aufmerksam, freundlich und schnell."
3,It's an old theater what can I say? I totally HATE the parking here but I think they are in the works of redoing it... I think the service can be a bit slow and they need to get some more ticket kiosks!!!! The chairs are not all that comfortable and the screens are just ok. I come here for the convenience factor of it being close to my house and also because it's one of the few theaters where you don't have to walk through a busy casino to get to.. just in and out. They also seem to play a couple independent documentaries and movies that I don't really see elsewhere.. I thought Village Square was a dying plaza but with all these new restaurants coming into it there is still hope!!! \n\nHOT TIP: If there is a long line outside at the box office don't get tricked like I did by the sign that says to use the kiosk in the lobby.. There's usually a short line for that ONE KIOSK too and trust me.. people do not know how to use the kiosk and take FOREVER! lol
3,"After two hours of suffering in the YMCA half-marathon this weekend, my wife and I were driving back home and noticed The Nile Cafe. Well, to be fair, we noticed that there was a sign for a new coffee shop called Rev right next to the Quizno's. We got out of our car and noticed that Rev is still a shell with nothing in it, and we walked to the other side of the buildings and happened across Nile.\n\nThis place is so new it was tough to tell it was open. Nothing in the way of decoration, but so what? I don't eat paintings!\n\nWe just grabbed a large container of their Cilantro-Jalapeno hummus ($5.75)  and some pita bread and took it home. Let me tell ya, it's got some kick! It's definitely my favorite hummus, and I will try putting this even on things hummus doesn't belong on! \n\nI had to knock a couple stars off for the store-bought pitas. The Nile Cafe is gonna have to do better on the pitas to compete. But I still plan on rounding up some work friends and trying these guys for lunch. Schwarma, falafel, howashi and tabouli all sound good to me! The chicken curry soup sounds tasty, too.\n\nI'll update this after my first real meal there. But go get some hummus. Seriously."
3,"I have has Jason's before at catered luncheons and always enjoyed it,  but never ate in. Salad bar is a five! Very well stocked with everything you could want! However, I ordered the Mediterranean Wrap and it wasn't very good. The tortilla wrap was too thick/firm and the filling seemed meager. I wouldn't order it again. So disappointed!"
3,"This is a good place to go if you are looking for East Coast style Chinese cuisine. We ordered from the menu rather than having the buffet, we just don't do buffets. The food definitely met our expectations, good portion sizes, hot, and fresh. The waitstaff knows very little English and is limited so customer service was somewhat poor. The atmosphere is also quite loud with the cooks and waitstaff yelling back and forth in Chinese between the buffet and kitchen. The dining area is also dated and not very clean looking. We will use them for take out only in the future."
3,"We came here on a Thursday evening. 2 AYCE dinners. 15.12 each with boarding pass\n\n- NEW Sign ups get a 2 for 1 buffet! \n- Already used it? Ask your friend to sign up and use theirs! haha. Cashiers don't check. Make sure you bring cash! haha :D\n- 30-35min wait time at 8pm. Err'body hungay bruh. \n- $3.75 ATM fee. dammit! :/\n- Nigiri sushi fail. I guess you have to come earlier\n- Love the chinese fried chicken! small wings! better than the american style.\n- Get the tofu stir fry! \n- Soups are tasty, even though a bit salty. get the hot and sour soup and chicken noodle!\n- Always have to get tacos! Not as wet as Sunset Station\n- BBQ ribs bonus! summer special! \n- Chopped sweet potatoes! At Sunset, they give you the whole piece!"
3,"The fried seafood is good, but a bit overpriced. I could get something almost as good at Long John Silvers for alot less. Overall, it was ok. Nothing to write home about."
3,Pretty good selection of items.  I have seen better.  The pharmacy people are really nice and helpful.  I would probably be back here to visit the pharmacy.
3,"Good variety, mostly comfort food, nothing fancy, which may be good for those that don't like fancy cuisine. Kid friendly, good prime rib, coffee sucks."
3,"Decent southern food. Great Biscuits!!  I would come here again to try their breakfast, but stopped in for the lunch.  Soup was amazing, but the southern fried catfish was very thin. I am used to southern cooking where the catfish is very thick and real good.  The fried okra was good as well.  I will be back to look into this place some more!"
3,"Not really a burger palace.  You can't add another patty, make your own burger or have different types of meats.\n\nFood is a bit pricey, pretty basic menu and honestly I would rather go to five guys."
3,"The food was a 3.5, the ambiance a 2. When we walked in the employees seemed surprised that we were there to eat.  The only menus that they have are paper to go menus which feel a little weird when you are eating in. They don't have any music or TV in the background which made us feel like we were intruding on their work. As they say, 'the silence was deafening.' The booth where we were seated had a large outdoor sign tucked behind it which awkwardly stuck out during our meal. The seating layout is also very strange. The good news is that the food was really good and they deliver. I think I may order delivery from them, but wouldn't dine in again. Rendezvous Cafe seems like a catering business, not a restaurant."
3,The Saturday night Noches Caliente Latin Dance Party features a live band and a lively and enthusiastic crowd of locals and out-of-town visitors eager to dance. The  $10 cover charge includes a drink (with limitations on what you can order) and Live Entertainment Tax. There is seating with tables on 3 sides of the dance floor with good views of both the stage and those dancing. Wear shoes with some traction. The wooden floor was a lot more slippery than expected.
3,"I usually love hole in the wall places.  The service usually ends up being great but the service here was a little slow and seemed in disarray.  I ordered the garlic bread which was your average bread and yummy.  The bolognese was great, but it's also hard to mess up bolognese in my opinion.  There wasn't anything super spectacular about it, so at the end of the day, very average."
3,"Love Amsterdam! Went there forever ago for fun $2 martinis and manicures on Tuesday nights. The show is awesome too, there's no way to go and not have a fun time!"
3,"The thing about Kohl's is that you HAVE to shop the sales and use coupons.  If you don't, you're not going to get a good price.  That being said, I always take advantage of these things and end up getting toys, books, and decor for very reasonable prices.\n\nThe selection of toys seems to change pretty regularly which leads me to believe that they turn their inventory quickly and that you're always getting the latest and greatest.\n\nGreat selection of kitchen tools, bathroom decor, and frames, but again, shop the sales on these items!\n\nI haven't shopped for adult clothing in a while, so I can't comment on that, but I've noticed that the children's clothing - even on sale - is a bit more expensive than what you can get it for elsewhere.  You've gotta wait until it goes on clearance or use a coupon that you can stack on top of the sales prices to get a deal."
3,"I only give them a 3 due to the service and excessive bread crumbs. \n\nFirst impression was the girls upfront are snotty bitches. We had to push our dinner reservation an hour and the three girls up front literally talked shit to each other about our group when three of them walked away to get seated. Should have saw the look on there face when they realized I was in the party and just heard everything they said. \n\nThe restaurant itself is very nice. It would have been better to sit up top but someone rented that out for a private party. \n\nOur initial waiter passed us off to an Asian guy which we all thought was odd, including our \""new\"" waiter. \n\nEntrees were very good. Filets, ribeye and sebass were what you would expect. The sides on the other hand were extremely disappointing. The creamed spinach and mac and cheese weren't just topped with panko, they were completely mixed in which made them disgusting. Thankfully the mashed potatoes didn't have any at all. \n\nMake sure you are very specific when asking to box up the leftovers!! Out of a ribeye, two filets and 3 sides all that was packed was the ribeye and 1 filet. And there was a lot left on the sides since we hardly touched 2 of them. \n\nMight give it another shot when I'm in the area again."
3,"I'm not Filipino, but it didn't matter, went with some colleagues as a 'completed training' celebration.  They ate, I got their too late, but what was left looked REALLY good.\n\nThe music was great, but being from NYC (we're not big on Kareoke) it was a little strange and it died out A LOT once the singing started.\n\nEveryone was very nice, even go to dance some salsa!!!\n\nAnyway, had a great time regardless.  Would go back."
3,"Location makes this place the best choice for anyone that forgets to bring food to school (CSN). Was not really the best I have had at Chipotle, it fact, it may have been the worse, but I did waste time waiting to be NOT served at McDonald's next door (SEE review) after leaving with my fat burrito and then I had to walk all the way to Building Kilo so I can fire up my Smartpop in the microwave (just discovered that there is a micro-onda [actually two] in Bravo building as well). \n\nSo yeah, it was a smudge cold. And the food as they were placing it onto the tortilla did not look as fresh as Doug E. Fresh (in the 80s) either. I went in the early evening, and there was only two other customers in the restaurant, so maybe a visit during the busy lunch hour would be a better barometer on the best they can do. \n\nOverall, the carnitas burrito with brown rice/pinto/pico/lechuga was alright. I consumed every morsel. - E"
3,After making this post.  My husband received a call from the manager at pep boys.  Well I appreciate his apologizes for the poor service.  I do think the company and people should be aware of the problem we had experienced.  I am updating this review and adding stars because I think it does show a good manager trying to right a wrong situation so thanks.
3,"Definitely good Thai food.  Their prices are on the high side considering the 3rd world setting of their location.  Have been here numerous times - and the food is always extremely tasty and spiced to perfection although portions are on the small side.  This restaurant reeks of pine-sol/lysol that they use on the table.  The smell gave everyone a headache.  They should definitely air out this place a bit.\n\nVery sketchy location: inside a run down strip mall with swingers clubs, massage parlors, and who knows what else.  In fact last time we pulled up in front of the restaurant and saw the guy in the car next to us get fellatio from an oriental lady.  Gross.  I don't mind restaurants in low rent areas but this place takes the cake.  I can't really bring out of town guests here anymore with all the strange activities going on around the restaurant in this bizarre, depressing area.  \n\nThe male waiters are extremely friendly and helpful but the ladies at the front are total bi***es."
3,"Bring cash and small bills. There is a change machine that will give you back coins. They will change it out for bills in the gift shop, but avoid the hassle."
3,"Booked two rooms for my mom and aunt. The rooms were fine, staff was bad and  good. We had one big problem with the reservation, which left a sour taste in my mouth. I had the call recorded and that saved my mom the extra sixty seven dollars.  Besides that I can't say too much positive, as the hotel needs some upgrades, and the buffet was not provided as promised. Finally the pool was filthy. I like the RIO pool way better. The Luxor needs work, as does the staff, and wait to check in."
3,"This is one of the few places in Vegas that does not try to rip you off. I think the best time to come to this restaurant is lunch time. They have great lunch specials at $5.99. I ordered grilled chicken with mashed potatoes and vegetables while my friend ordered the mushroom penne pasta. I think my grilled chicken was better than her mushroom penne dish. The chicken was a little dry, but immerse it in the mashed potatoes and all of a sudden it becomes okay.\n\nThe most annoying part about the experience is that there is a lady who comes over to your table and asks you if you want your picture taken so you can have a souvenir card. However, as much as this sounds enticing, it is a nuisance because once they bring you the postcard, they also try to sell you your picture. Beware, just kindly decline when this lady approaches you. I do not know why they do this. \n\nAlso, the seats on the outside of the restroom are uncomfortable (they are plastic chairs). The seats in the restaurant look much more comfortable and I'd recommend sitting inside."
3,"The service was very very slow. The waitresses and hostesses were dressed very young and not very professional. (I get this is a chill restaurant with a chill vibe, but when the employees look like they just left the gym with tight spandex leggings, form-fitting tank tops, and messy buns, I couldn't tell who worked there and who was dining there). However, the sweet potato tots were TO DIE FOR (I found myself craving them weeks later) and the burger was really good. I will definitely be back to try the PBJ & Bacon Burger that everyone has raved about, but the slow service could absolutely use some improvement."
3,"This place is a little overrated -- or maybe we ordered the wrong things -- either way, Lotus of Siam did not live up to our expectations! Sure the outside is a little run down but coming from San Francisco, I know that the best places are the small holes in the wall! We ordered an order of the chicken wings, a papaya salad, a tom yum noodle soup.. and the last one I don't remember. It's not bad but I've had better. \n\nThey get 2 stars for the food and an extra star for fitting us in on a Friday night. We were told when we approached the hostess that it's fully booked and we had to wait at least an hour for a table for 4... the hostess then told us to wait 5 minutes and gave us a table!\n\nIf you've never had Thai food, this is a good first!"
3,"Come for the Thursday trivia, stay for the bar fights. Reasonably priced rotating Great Lakes tap is also a plus."
3,"I feel like a little bitch today, but please put down your drink so you can serve mine, especially after you are out of what you told me to order. Usually good beans, but shoddy service today...everywhere. Thanks millenials!"
3,"Coole Location. Leider was zu gro\u00df, daher wirkte alles leicht verloren. Schade auch, dass ab xx:xxuhr der Club (sowie Personal etc.) von gay zu straight wechselt. Aber sonst super"
3,"Pure is okay, it's a bit more of an older crowd from what I've noticed, but can still be fun. There's a cool Grecian theme with lots of flowing white drapery. Last time I was here, the bartender was pregnant... I thought that was interesting. My favorite part of this club is the upstairs part on the rooftop bar. There's a nice view of the strip."
3,"I go more out of convenience than preference. Its an odd place, with lots of odd characters. I have never been there at night, but I am guessing that it gets even more \""interesting\"" at night. I think Metro SB is having an identity crisis. I am not sure if it is a dive, a club, a restaurant, a pool hall... But that is okay. I will still continue to go there. \nNote: They are a cash only bar, but they do have an ATM machine, which I am sure charges a ridic service fee. So bring your cash!"
3,"I've gotta go with A-OK on this one. Not quite ready to commit to being \""a fan,\"" yet. \n\nTo me, being \""a fan\"" would mean I would be willing to drive from North Central Phoenix all the way downtown, devil-may-care style on a work day, to wait in line and put up with the slamming of the metal door every time a customer's lunch order was fulfilled. (That's not a complaint, mind you. It was cool. All part of the charm.)\n\nYou see, dinner is not an option. They're only open until 4. \n\nThat said, I obeyed Robert M.'s instructions and ordered a green chile burrito, enchilada style with a side of beans. The beans were runny but good for dipping my bites of burrito. The sauce that made it  \""enchilada style\"" had a good heat. \n\nI was pleased. It was \""A-OK.\"" I'd go back. Just probably not devil-may-care on a work day."
3,"I only got biscotti from the biscotti side. Flavors were good, consistency was meh. I don't know what it is about my experience with PIT, but I thought the Italian food was supposed to be better than what I've been getting.\n\nFor some reason, it was just overly crumbly. It fell apart, like dust. Perhaps it was the humidity?"
3,"Went to Koi in July.  Just realized I didn't write a review. \nI wanted to eat at the Sushi bar, unfortunately it is not wheelchair accessible, so I ate in the main dining area. My server was very nice and apologetic about it.I ordered Sushi anyway. My standard Salmon and Eel. It was very good, but much smaller portions than at Simon. I also ordered the Sunset roll, which was Eel an cucumber inside with Avocado and special sauce on top. Another very good dish.  I had a Sake flight with my food.  This is a very nice way to try several types without sliding out of my chair!   I wish it was more wheelchair accessible, but I did enjoy the food and I am going back in a couple weeks to give it another try! Probably more like 3 1/2 stars."
3,"A friend of mine wanted wanted to meet up at TT Roadhouse, so that's why I ended up there.  She told me it had a cool jukebox, but when I arrived I found out it wasn't as cool as I had thought.  It was pretty punk rock, but I was able to find a few Jawbreaker tracks to make me happy.  Drinks were decently priced, and the clientele was not your typical Old Scottsdale crowd.  Nothing amazing, though, but if you're in the area..."
3,"The service is great - very nice staff.  \nThe food is okay - probably some of the best in Madison, but not excellent.  We usually get the chicken makhani - which is the best dish we've found.  The tikka masala is alright - not great.  The naan and paratha are good."
3,"Pretty Good Airline overall, more of a Bus in the Sky if you will. I have actually grown to like the anything goes, sit-where-you-want thing they got going. Minus 1 star because they always take forever to unload the baggage here. But they don't lose it (like they do in Burbank and Sacramento)."
3,"A small family owned business that I frequent often,  they have excellent pastries and bread!  It would be nice if they expanded on spices and sauces and some other traditional items. \n\nWord of caution:  I don't know if it a supply and demand issue but the shelves are often very empty...so don't go at the last minute as you may not find what you ate looking for. \n\nBe sure to get a slice of apple strudel!"
3,"The food here was outstanding as one would expect of a Wynn facility.  Lobsters were roasted perfectly & filet was perfectly done and seasoned excellent.  Facility wonderful. \n\nWhat drove down the rating was the SERVICE - lack of..  \n\nThe Host staff were great, welcomed us and sent us to the bar to wait on our table.  Then when the table was ready came up to us and address us by name to leads us to our table.  That nice touch instead of calling out a name to a room of people.\n\nThe table service started out good.  They rolled our the lobster cart and we ordered immediately.  Great energy and sense of humor.  \n\nThen we get turned over to our waiter and table staff.  All down hill from here.  Once the food arrived, there was no check back to see if everything was good.  To get drink refills we had to rudely call out at wait staff as they dashed by - at times more than once just for drink refills.  \n\nPrice point - Vegas reasonable.  With menus online, if you are surprised by a bill you just didn't plan ahead.  But the service concerns WILL prevent me from bringing guests back here in future trips.  Botero is safer option at Wynn."
3,"I'm lucky that I'm able to come during a time when everyone is at work, so I can't really comment on the busy times. \n\nMy biggest complaint? One of the check-in staff is the rudest person I've ever encountered. He never says hi, I have to ask for a towel each time, and he's just straight up impersonal, almost to the point of being hostile. Dude. If you don't like your job, get another one. Everyone else I've ever checked in with manages to make eye contact, say hello, and glance at the screen to know that I get a towel.\n\nOther than that, I enjoy coming here because it's clean, fast, and people don't really bug you."
3,"I am excited aobut the larger menu choices now.  I asked two employees when that happened and neither of them knew.  I am guessing very recent. My burger was very good.  Next time I will order it medium rare.  It was too well done for my taste.  I asked for hot fries and I got them.  My daughter was disappointed with the pretzels and beer cheese.  We told the waitperson that there was something wrong with the cheese.  Beer cheese is usually orange and very creamy.  It cost $7 too.  It was pretzel bites.  The cheese was whitish and watery and tasted like salad dressing.  Looked like ranch to me, without the garlic.  My daughter said it was awful.  When I tasted it, I knew something was wrong with it.  It was REALLY bad...tasteless and watery...no taste of cheese or beer whatsoever.  The waitress did not appear to believe me or offer to replace it...that was surprising.  She should have insisted on bringing another bowl or comping it.  I felt bad because my daughter ordered appetizers instead of a meal.  Happy to see appetizers and other sandwiches now on the menu.  Always associated Goldies with burgers, wings, and pizzas.  I will come back and try a sandwich."
3,"Came here to get a full body massage.  It was okay.  The one thing I didn't like is that since it is just one big room, you get distracted by hearing other people chatting, walking about, and some even make noises when they get massaged.  I kinda wish they would separate the beds by a screen or something.  I wasn't totally relaxed but I guess that's what you get for the price you pay. \n\nThe lady that did my massage was nice, at first she was gentle but she went pretty hard on my shoulders...and they're still sore the next day.  \n\nThe other weird thing is that when you go pay at the front, your masseurs go to the front and just wait for you to tip them.  It's like they won't leave or let you leave till they get tipped.\n\nIt was definitely an experience, but I probably won't be going there again."
3,"I'll start with the reason why I gave 3 stars and not 5 stars.\nAmbience was terrible. When I go to a winery I don't expect it to be like a night out at a club; however, when you go out you want the environment to be appealing. There was no music (non that I remember), few crowds, quiet, and the servers were in jeans. \nBruschetta was not up to par. It was made on regular toast, small, thin, and flavorless.\nMushroom risotto, Twisted burger, and Mac and cheese were on point!! Like amazing. The risotto was vegetarian so if you have a larger appetite I recommend adding a protein.  \nThe service was excellent! \nOverall, my husband and I enjoyed the meal but the overall experience may be forgetful when deciding on a future date night."
3,"After I found out that Sephora stocks Korres products I headed over to the new store in Fairview, Pointe Claire. Apparently Sephora Quebec doesn't stock Korres but Ontario stores do, due to packaging regulations (i.e language, as Korres products are in Greek and English)\n\nCompletely ridiculous and another reason consumers will always find a way to buy elsewhere if they don't get access to what they want. So I can shop online at SkinStore.com and only pay 5$ shipping from the USA for an entire order.\n\nApart from that, Sephora did have a great selection of brands, not all girly, if you know what you are looking for.   Staff were very helpful and  love to to direct you to the $150 creams (sorry couldn't resist). I would recommend researching the brands first though, many may just be in there because they have compliant packaging rather than really being the best brands you can buy. Many were missing in the store from the Sephora website. The prices seemed inline with elsewhere i.e. Dr. Hauschka prices were the same as Olgivy's, but again, I would compare as some products may have a premium attached to the price simply because you can't readily get access to that brand elsewhere in Montreal. \n\nAnother thing that sucks is that on the Sephora website orders in the US over 50$ are free, however Canadian orders it's over $150 to get free shipping, Again, check out skinstore.com"
3,"Outdoor mall.  More for the 40+ crowd.  On a warm day, it's a nice place to walk around as there's mist sprays everywhere and various restaurants to eat at."
3,"Stayed here for a last minute trip to vegas on the 4th of July.  Flew in, took the cab which didn't take more than 10 minuites,  paid the $15 fare that included tip, and I was checked in at no time.  There were 6 of us so we were able to make use of our 2 bedroom suite with full kitchen.  Great, inexpensive hotel if you wanna be away from all the glamour and glitz of vegas.  Its away from the strip but free shuttle service is provided to MGM, Mandalay, and airport as well.  This particular hotel gets an OK rating, cause lets face it, this hotel has nothing on others along the strip.  \n\nTip: If a cab is desired, make sure to give yourself sufficient time.  The hotel is away from all the action therefore cabs hate coming out in that direction and if they do show up, they don't have the patience to wait for you.  Make an effort to be at the lobby at the time the front desk tells you to be there for your taxi.  A minute late and your ride will be gone.  Take this seriously, most especially if you have dinner reservations or a show to attend."
3,"The further they move up Eastern, the less I tend to like them. For years, my family have gone their to buy birthday cakes, but Freed's quality has deteriorated. \n\nWhen I first came back from Korea, they were the first bakery I went to because I missed it so much. Strawberry Shortcake, Black Forest, and fruit tarts were my favorite. A few more visits and I find that the cakes are too sweet and a bit dry. It could be that my taste has changed, but then again, so did their prices. For something that is not as good as before, the cost has gone up on their items.\n\nPeople mention that the service is nonexistent. It is more like spotty. Sometimes it is great with people walking around, handing out samples, and chatting with customers. Other times, it is neglectful."
3,"Decided to take the family here after receiving a coupon and was intrigued by the all natural concept. We loved the decor and the place seemed clean. We were immediately disappointed when we discovered the lack of a kids menu. We were informed by the staff that we could order anything plain. So we get to pay $6 for a burger for our 6 year old. Same with the hot dogs. You pay for a Chicago dog and then tell them to hold all the good stuff.  Fries are separate although the large seemed to feed us all. We ordered waters and were presented with 5 shot glass sized plastic cups. I realize they make money on drinks but this is Arizona!  We need water. \n\nThe only saving grace is that the food was pretty good. The burgers were small but had good flavor.  Just wondering how American cheese made into an all natural place.\n\nWe may come back, but I doubt we will make a special trip."
3,"Our group stayed here for our Vegas trip. I would have much more liked to stay in a burlap sack. I understand that renovations take time and money. Seeing that this place robs people at the table, you would think ALL of thier rooms would reflect that. NOPE\n\nThey have 4 different buildings and unfortunatley my friend was in the \""old building\"". His room was literally 2 beds and a TV. The service at the front desk is non existant and the bellhop looks like they are angry at you.  \n\nI couldnt complain about my room but i wondered to myself...why aren't all the rooms like this? The Wold Fare Buffet was disgusing and there is a food court inside of the Casino with all terrible eateries. \n\nThey just need to punch up this place alot more to be competing with other Hotel and Casinos on the Vegas Strip."
3,"DH & I went to Upper Crust for Happy Hour. We had a pizza and wings, which were on happy hour specials. The pizza was good, similar to the grimaldi's style. The wings were a one star. The ambiance was a little dark, could use some color. Lots of TV's to watch any game were available."
3,"I was really really torn on whether to give H&H 3 or 4 stars!!  \n\nThe cocktails are standard quality craft cocktails, but without any frills and nothing particularly spectacular about it.\n\nThe atmosphere/decor is just ok.  It's very bare and, due to the lack of crowd, empty feeling.  I suppose we did go out for drinks at around 8 on a Sunday evening, but I mean, who doesn't do that? right? :p \n\nService was pretty average as well.  There was only one bartender/staff, but it was sufficient for the small number of people.  He also didn't seem too interested in telling us more about the cocktails and basically told us all the cocktails were great.\n\nIn the end, we choose the Agnatha & Anni and the August 21st, 1959.  I really liked my Agnatha.  Crisp, tart, strong.  I didn't like all the tiny ice bits in it though, but that's easily remedied as the ice melts.  The August 21st was ok.  I'm not a fan of smoky flavored drinks, but if you are, this one would be a good choice.\n\nOverall, I would come back again because it's just too convenient.  Plenty of street parking, closely located, solid cocktails, and no worries about finding a table."
3,Great Sushi have to try the spicy tuna..I also tried the Fillet mignon steak & chicken and was a bit dissipointed. The chicken was a bit dry.. But after I asked for some teriyaki sauce... It was all god again...Over all I was impressed.. When I'm back in town I defently will be stopping back by to try somthing different...
3,This is definitely not the place to go if you have older children.  This place is catered for kids under the age of 8.  They do have laser tag though which can entertain the older kids- but beware of the little ones in there too!
3,"The food here is okay, there is nothing in particular that has ever impressed me. Not even anything uniquely bad  but nothing ever sticks out. I have eaten here a couple of times and though the service is good, the food just comes across as bland and boring, almost like everything is pre-packaged or came to the restaurant as frozen."
4,"Doing meetings at the Ritz so have ended up in the bar and restaurant (Bistro 24). What a pleasant surprise - especially on a Friday night. They have their Grill Night buffet and it is soooo worth it. \n\nAppetizer buffet includes Blue Point oysters, lobster bites, fabulous seared tuna with wasabi cream, cute filet mignon bites, shrimp, duck and cheese fun stuff..etc.\n\nSushi stand. Enough said.\n\nOutdoors is the grill....filet mignon, lamb chops, organic salmon, grilled shrimp....mashed potatoes...grilled greens.....\n\nThe Dessert stand....decadent.\n\nWine list...va bene!"
4,"some of the best dining experiences happen when you almost don't go inside the restaurant. this is the kind of eatery that makes you thankful for crappy strip malls.\n\nsure, the exterior isn't great. and the neighborhood isn't perfect. but this place is small, friendly, clean. the food is excellent\n\nmy friend and i tried las glorias because we were in the area and we had a coupon. we were incredibly happy with ourselves after we found this place.\n\nthe chips were crisp and fresh. the bean and salsa dips were delectable. the rice was great. the portions were large. my friend said this place reminds her of her very favorite spot from home. she is something of a chile relleno connoisseur, and she said this one was among the best she had ever had. this batter and lots of cheese.\n\nwe will definitely be going back., coupon or not."
4,"I read all the reviews before buying the Groupon, so I knew what to expect. Since I am a master procrastinator, I waited until it was almost expired to make my appointment. Luckily the girl was able to fit me in with a few days to spare! They had the girls team up with Jennifer doing my mani and Kelly did my pedi. Both girls did a good job, they were friendly and it took about and hour and a half. My two complaints would be 1) It was a little awkward because I sat in a chair facing sideways for the pedi and turned my torso for the mani, I saw they had a room with couches for the ladies just getting pedis and it looked more comfortable. 2) I didn't think they had a good enough color selection for me, as I prefer nude shades. They explained to me that after I used my Groupon, I had one more discounted visit and then I would be paying full price, which is not nearly as expensive as going to a salon. I don't have my nails done very often, but I hope to be back soon!"
4,"The food and service was the best I have had in a long time, could have done without the creepy guy with the dog inside the place health code violation I am sure."
4,"A friend and I made reservations here during Restaurant Week. The atmosphere was welcoming, if a bit sterile-feeling, but the drinks were tasty and potent. I started with the Pickle Plate, which had a variety of pickled veggies. For my entree I had the  pan-seared trout with barley risotto. It was nicely prepared and very tasty. For dessert I had the key lime pie (because I can never say \""no\"" to key lime pie).\n\nOverall, it was a pleasant experience and I'm definitely looking forward to returning and trying the regular menu."
4,"My first experience at Vintage was on Valentine's Day and sat outside on patio by the fire. Very classy and they have an amazing Sangria. Most Saturday nights they have one of my fav local singers, Sarah, she is a great performer. This is a great place for a date night or a chill place for friends to meet."
4,"this has always been our go to for Chinese food at a buffet\n\nliving in Vegas my whole life we have had a lot of Chinese food places come and but this place never fails to be fresh.\n\nif you are into sushi they have an entire sushi bar and its very fresh and kept up to date they even have little stickers of when they were put out on the buffet so you can ensure that  it is not too old\n\nthey have an amazing selection of Mongolian barbeque and it's like a pic your own Chinese food and they cook it fresh for you it is to die for\n\nthis place is pretty big and seats a lot of people has a lot of traffic so very rarely do I see a wait but it is always packed and because it is always packed the food turnover is incredibly quick  very rarely have I seen dishes cold,  empty or close to empty usually its full fresh heaping piles of goodness that you can scoop on to your plate\n\nthey have fresh crawfish hot and cold they have a good soup selection and a great Chinese selection all the way from fried rice to want on soup too fried wontons to pot stickers to muscles to hot wings to pizza for the kids\n\nit is definitely worth the price you will not regret going \n\nEnjoy!!"
4,"It's time for a Bricktop's update - and yes, while the stars are still the same I just had to offer some info about their brunch. Because...it.is.delicious. \n\nYes, a friend of mine sang a pretty song about Bricktop's brunch and within days hubs and I flew over to this SouthPark staple for some goodness. Their brunchy menu is in similar style to their lunch and dinner menu - new American eclectic. Not only do they offer a make your own bloody mary bar, but they also host a variety of specialty drinks (think blood orange mimosas and bellinis by the carafe - NOM). \n\nI've eaten the same tasty dish both brunch visits - the French Toast. Big toasty brioche slices with sides of caramelized bananas, warm maple syrup, fresh whipped cream and crispy bacon. It's delicious not at all nutritious and heavy on the portion for $11. Also, if you're feeling quite indulgent check out the bite size homemade doughnut starter - 13 sugar doughnuts with three dipping sauces (raspberry, chocolate and vanilla cream). \n\nThe brunch bill can get a bit out of hand here, especially when you start drinking your weight in mimosas, but it's worth it. Check it out!"
4,"Cantina rocks. \n\nYou wouldn't know it from the way it looks outside, but Cantina serves up awesome food and even better drinks from south of the border. It's packed on weekends--usually with a somewhat younger, louder crowd, but it's by no means a fratty place--so make a reservation in advance and prepare to wait a little once you show up, but trust me: it's worth it. \n\nCantina has all you'd expect from a nicer Mexican restaurant, with a lot of the extras. You'll definitely want to order a top-shelf margarita--easily one of the best in Charlotte, if not the best. Try the Kiwi/Strawberry Special if you're up for a change; it's delicious. Good Mexican beers are on tap as well. Drink up. Everyone else is. \n\nAs for the food, I dont know where to begin or end. The chopped tostada salad is to die for if it's lighter fare you're craving. If you want some good 'ol refriend beans and pulled chicken, you won't be disappointed. My favorite? The Kobe beef fajitas. Trust me. Order this. \n\nI'm definitely going back. What I wont do, however, is plan on having a big night afterward. The scene is fun and loud, but you're about as full and tired as you can be when the meal's over. Which is a good thing."
4,The food here is fantastic. It gets really busy at lunch time so you should either come early or late if you want to sit down when you get there.
4,Cheap beer decent food. You get what you came for in this place. Can get loud but that's to be expected from a blue collar dive bar
4,"We were shopping while on a visit to Montreal, and were delighted to see a traditional bar without astronomical prices. The open air seating was great for people watching, and the staff was very friendly. The only disappointment was the lack of food - if you don't count the grilled cheeses they make on a small hot plate behind the bar."
4,"Borealis is probably my favourite restaurant in the Cambridge area. The very often used slogan think globally act locally is taken to heart by this lovely restaurant since all food and beverages at this reataurant are supposedly sourced locally to the Waterloo Region or within Ontario. The food is consistantly great with some variation in menu items based on local avilability and the chef. The drink menu has a pretty decent selection of Ontario beers and wines that wil keep your thrist quenched. Service has never been a problem but it has never been stellar either. The interior is a converted period building of some type, I believe it was a school house at one point and evokes a great atmosphere which also features a large concreate patio out front of the restaurant. Make sure you check out the specials as there are often great drink deals on.\n\nI'd like to give this place 5 stars due to its excellent combination of food, drink and atmosphere with local touch but the price point is a little too high to keep coming back regularly so 4 stars from me, check it out!"
4,"This is really a great shop. What you find is hit or miss- as is true with most consignment stores.  BUT I have been able to find a few things every time I enter.  babyGap jeans and plenty of other good labels (Janie and Jack, The Children's Place).   I love this store and now that I am prego again need to check out their maternity section also."
4,Don't be put off by the name if you are not a wine fan -- there is plenty to drink.  Went there for lunch and was very impressed by the efficient and friendly staff as well as good food.
4,Where the sauce is the boss and the toast is the most. Canes chicken doesn't have anything really spacial about it and the fries are not anything exciting either. But the sauce is amazing i have to get four extra every time to dip my chicken and my fries in it. I am a fan of slaw but canes slaw is pretty bland so I usually substitute more toast for the slaw.
4,"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Both locations are great, but I prefer the west side. They have over 20 vegetarian selections and I gotta tell you I am a creature of habit and I would eat here every day if I could. They have some of the most amazing salads, try the Bruschette Salad and the Athens Fries are amazinggggg."
4,"Oh, la la! I was aimlessly driving around Henderson, looking for a place to get some good lunch eats - each strip mall I passed featured some sort of random chain restaurant. I was about to settle on Taco Bell when I saw an oasis in the desert - Trader Joe's!\n\nThis just opened recently, so it had the \""new car smell.\"" It was clean, had wide aisles and all the fabulous products! And best of all, it wasn't crowded like the SF locations!\n\nI went to their ready made sandwich section, there were a few veggie options - I settled on the PB&J sandwich lunch bag for $3.49. This is the first time I've ever seen this kind of offering, and it was good. You get a 1/2 PB&J sandwich, a little bag of cut green apples, a little bag of 100 calorie cookies, string cheese and small bottle of water. The sandwich was by no means the best - the bread was a little dry and the PB&J fillings were strangely stiff in texture, but the thought of having the other tasty treats in the bag kept me going.\n\nFor $3.49, I think this was a great deal. I'm hoping I can find it when I go back home to SF..."
4,There are not many restaurant choices in this area so Squid Ink satisfies that sushi craving! I order carry-out more often than dining in and service is usually quick and food is decent. Happy hour is very good as long as you prefer the less creative rolls. I recommend it but it is a little pricey for the quality.
4,People honestly review airports? As if you have options? As if you honestly decide whether or not to visit a city because of it's airport? The fact this this has 800+ reviews blew my mind!
4,"Tryst is no longer the IT spot of Vegas as Marquee or XS but it still is a nice beautiful club. The sister of XS with the nice outdoor waterfall and ambient lighting all around. There are the poles for the girls to make a fool of themselves while all the guys around the phone whip out their cellphone cameras LOL and the music was good. The bars were so busy  but maybe because we only went to the one closest to the dancefloor...\n\nMy group of 2 girls and 2 guys decided to head to Tryst around 1 am after watching lame-o show, KA (see my review) and getting our free buzz on at the casino tables.\n\nEarlier that evening, i put my name down under a host for guestlist. 1 am is beyond the  guestlist time but the front door people let us in no charge and without a problem or hassle. Things like this makes the clubbing experience so much better because you don't waste time or kill your buzz."
4,"Okay, the place is no frills, simple, would almost qualify for Triple D... Except, it TASTES good.  We've been to a few Triple D joints and most have been disappointing, making me wonder how much they pay to grab Guy's attention and the publicity.  Flavors of Louisiana brings it!!!!  Flavor, taste, smell, appearance, and portion... All good.  What would make them great?  One thing... Liquor license... so I could have a beer with my fab fish!\n\nGlad I grabbed the 'go' box because I had serious craving the next day. It reheated perfectly and I learned that the flavor was really the ingredients and not over saturation of grease.\n\nMomma loved her Gumbo and appreciated that there were NOT huge slimy chunks of okra in it.  The main man and I had oysters, chicken, and catfish... All worthy of ordering again and again and again.  I enjoyed the tater salad but we both thought the dirty rice could have used more meat in much, much larger pieces.  As it was the meat was so minimal and small it could not be tasted even though I could see it... That, and the lack of beer, were the only down sides to our kickin' Lous-E-anna experience!"
4,great sandwiches however it ses to always take 1.5 or 2 of them to fill me up. so it becomes a tad pricey. However of you are just here for the taste or is easily satisfied then it's a great place tot go with friends. only downside is probably the long lines.
4,"Went here for our 10th anniversary. We've been before so we knew what to expect. I am happy to see that the menu is more a la carte than it used to be so you can skip courses to trim the costs a bit, or go all out and do the endless fondue. We came with a Groupon and they were great about it. I wasn't in love with the swiss cheese fondue that we had for an appetizer, but hubby liked it so it was probably just me. All of the other courses were great, and the serving sizes were reasonable (aka I was stuffed). We split a single dessert between the two of us and it was a perfect end to the meal. Service was a bit on the slow side (and it wasn't crowded), but this is not the place to go if you want a quick meal, so it wasn't a huge deal. I like to have a leisurely dinner and enjoy myself."
4,"Finally got around to trying Caffe Boa.  After watching Payton butcher a pig at Devoured, I really had no choice but to see what kinds of food this guy pumped out.\n\nI was impressed with the giant paper cone of french fries that I ordered an an app.  They were quite good and the sauces that came with them were out of this world.\n\nThe calzone that I ordered was probably not the best advised decision I've ever made.  It was good and I enjoyed the strange flatbread that housed the innards but it just didn't give me what I was looking for in a calzone.  It was good, just a bit weird for my tastes.  That's not to say that everything inside the flatbread wasn't good - it was.  I just wouldn't order this again.\n\nThe service was good and I enjoyed the patio but the strip mall feel left a lot to be desired.  I hope rent is cheap."
4,"If you've read a few of my reviews you would know that I don't frequent or recommend many franchise restaurants. But Texas Roadhouse is one of the few. I've probably been to 8 different locations in 5 different states and the service has always been good, the steak cooked the way I ordered and the value excellent. And this location is no exception. Our server was great, food was tasty and well prepared and the call ahead seating made our wait, oh, about a minute!"
4,"Smooth, rich, flavorful.... vegan?  I was a bit doubtful about trying soy gelato (soy-lato?), but after trying the spicy chocolate, I was hooked.  I had a mix of the chocolate soy and a regular mixed berry, and while both were very good, the mixed berry was a bit more icy rather than smooth.  The spicy chocolate was very rich, smooth, and had great spicy flavor.  I could not taste any real \""soy\"" flavor either, which was nice.  They have a diverse selection of flavors, including sugar free selections.  Definitely a great place to get dessert!"
4,"Very good breakfast place. It's only about a 10-15 minute drive from the strip bit it's worth it.\n\nWe went pretty early about 9 in the morning and it was already pretty full and this was on a Wednesday.  So if you go there any later and on a weekend I'm sure you may hit a waiting time.\n\nWe were seated immediately. We ordered Mama's french toast which comes with eggs and your choice of bacon, sausage or ham. I chose the sausage. Anthony ordered the ham steak plate and that comes with toast (he chose the Texas toast), potatoes, and eggs. Everything tasted right and was cooked nicely. I love my breakfast so it definitely hit the spot. Mr. Mama was even there himself and was a nice and dedixated, family centered man. Knowing someone like that ran the place was nice and he himself went around offering coffee to his guests."
4,"Literally hadn't been here in years. Went today to see 'Takin over the Asylum' and it was a great production! The theatre itself is beautiful, very classical with a massive chandelier and everything! Students get \u00a35 tickets on Wednesday matinees too!"
4,"I have to laugh b/c this is the second time I find myself quoting Nicole W. but she said it best \""Alexander Michael's is the quintessential go-to spot for solid food, good drinks and superb company all packaged into a quaint little spot in the 4th ward.\""\n\nEspecially if you live within walking distance, this is a place you will go again and again for an uncomplicated place to find simple food done right with quality beer selections.  I had the chicken pita.  I was not expecting that the chicken would be perfectly cooked, seasoned and the pita warm and robust.  A side of beans satisfied an additional protein craving without the temptation of the go-to french fries.\n\nThe place is too cute explaining on the back of the menu why there is a beam in the ladies room which finds itself the victim of unsuspecting visitors who inevitably find themselves in close contact with the supporting structure.  They also give some history on the house which makes good reading while you wait for your first round to show up.  \n\nSmall complaint that again, tv in the dining area.  I guess many people eat in front of the television at home and grow accustom to it?  Also, low ceilings make for a cozy atmosphere.  Probably not the #1 place for enjoying the natural sunlight of a gorgeous day."
4,"This place is sweet, I highly recommend it.  When you walk in the door be sure to look down at the floor because you're standing on a fish tank - pretty cool.  The decor is very trendy and the atmosphere is chill.  We had a drink at the bar on a Weds. night before heading out to the patio for dinner - not overly crowded which was nice.  The sushi was delicious - quality pieces and very fresh.  My only complaint was the bathroom sink - while very cool looking, the faucets don't work unless you slam the handle in and then the water just sprays out sporadically.  This was a little messy but the rest of the experience was great."
4,"What a great \""Americana\"" restaurant! This place brings back so many memories of what used to be very popular restaurant's back in the day ~  the buffet/cafeteria's.  This Furr's is conveniently located just west of the 101 Hwy on Grand and Sun City.  You can tell this Furr's has been around since the fifties based on their sign and building but they have done a very nice job maintaining everything inside and out.  \n\nI had a very enjoyable lunch last with some fellow Yelper's; Rand H., Mike C. and Scott W..  This Furr's is a cafeteria however once you go through the line once, you can go back as many times as you like to, all for the same price of $7.39.  I really liked this concept because your not picking through what other the prior people have handled ~ you know what I mean!  You choose what you want and they serve it to you.  \n\nThey have most of the traditional \""Americana\"" food options to choose from.  I recommend when you first go through the line asking for smaller portions and trying more varieties of things.  This way you can refill on what you really like without over stuffing yourself.  Everything was very tasty and fresh.  I'm looking forward to going back to this Furr's so hopefully I will see you there."
4,"Ive been to Culvers alot. My son loves it and the cheese curds are A-mazing! I always felt like it was a bit pricey for \""fast food\"" until I went to five guys... wow! Id pay the extra money for a butter burger anytime! Culvers is way better than any fast food burger place in Surprise hands down and also better than five guys and half the cost. I will never complain about the prices again. The shakes are good. The burgers and fries are good and as I said before.. cheese curds for the Win! :)"
4,"My wife and I came to this restaurant on a Friday night. The weather was beautiful so we decided to sit outside. The outside area was a little crowded. You can tell they try to fit as many tables and people in their patio as they can but it didn't bother us at all.  They also have an English menu which what was good, since we don't know any French. \n\nThis restaurant has a huge selection of different pizzas. They also have a huge selection of toppings. It can be a little overwhelming when deciding what to order. It took us a while to decide what we wanted. \n\nSo we finally decided and we ordered our pizza. We sat and talk for a while and enjoyed the nice weather. The pizza arrived pretty quickly and it was great. The crust was perfect. We had so many toppings on our pizza that we had to eat it with a fork and knife. I would've gave this restaurant 5 stars, but it only gets 4 because the service could have been better. I had to flag the waiter down on numerous occasion just to get more water. With that said, I definitely would go back to this place the next time i'm in Montreal."
4,I have been taking people here for 25 years. From celebrating a special occasion to taking my sons teachers there to wish them well on their retirement to taking our out of town visitors out for a Sunday brunch they will never forget- this is the place. You can't beat the view day or night.
4,"Pretty damned good vegan and vegetarian food for not a whole lot of green. Courteous and attentive staff. Solid music choices at an acceptable volume level. Kind of limited menu, but hey they've also got cruelty free pies. Space is also limited, but that just makes it easier for me to get work done while I wait for the delectables to arrive at the table."
4,"I love Grand Lux Cafe!!\n\nThis location is not quite as good as the Venetian location, but its just as nice.  Great servers, the place is nice & big & clean. Always a pleasure to eat here. \n\nMajor Recommendations:\nMolten Chocolate Cake. Seriously tastes as delicious as it sounds. I would go here just for this. Must order probably around when you get your first entree or appetizer, depending on how fast you eat, because it takes about 20 minute to prepare."
4,"This review is for the hotel only.  The room was exceptionally nice for the price. Clean and modern. The bed was also very comfortable--great pillows.  The shower was the best ever--convenient shelf, good lighting, great pressure. A nice lighted makeup mirror too that swivels for those of us that prefer to shave in the shower.    The rooms were quiet and the ventilation was excellent. These are the things a hotel room should be judged by.   \n\nStaff seemed pleasant and cooperative. Willing to accommodate when they can.  Not 5 stars only because my room service meals were a little inconsistent.  \n\nThe location speaks for itself. It's not the strip--thankfully."
4,"Love this place. I initially found it via the Phoenix LocalDines website and since then it's been the go-to date night restaurant for for my wife and I. We've only ever ordered from the dinner menu, so I can't testify to the quality of anything but the items they offer in the evening. However, we've never been disappointed and the variety keeps us coming back to try new things. \n\nTry the Blue Corn Enchiladas and Chimi with sour cream green chile sauce. And definitely order the Guacammus and Waffle Fries for appetizers... you won't be disappointed!"
4,"I really enjoyed this place! We got in early on a Thursday (first stop of the night since arriving) and tried to pay for drinks when the bartender informed us that all well drinks were free for the first hour! That was pretty fortunate for us, but not fortunate for the one guy in our group who ordered a non-well drink (and paid tons for it). The vibe was very chill, there were places to sit, and the music was great. Don't ignore this gem just because it's off the Strip! Pay for the cheap cab ride, get there early, and take advantage of their well drink special. You'd be stupid not to!"
4,"I think this place gets a bad rap. Sure, it might not have the same charm as Wrigley Field, but the seats are comfortable, the weather will never ruin the game, they use real grass on the field, and the layout is just designed so much better than any old ballpark. You never have to walk very far for a hot dog or a toilet.\n\nAlso, let's not kid ourselves about the Suns. In the last 10 years, the Diamondbacks have been the local major sports team with the best chance of winning a championship in any given year."
4,"Mystery Castle is pretty dang weird.  You get a lot of the vibe just by looking online, but it's definitely interesting to see in person.  The guy who built it used a lot of cheap, recycled items.  I was most fascinated by the burned bricks, they were super cool!  The two guys working were so incredibly nice and enthusiastic during the tour.  It's cash only, and I thought it was worth the price.\n\nHowever, it really seemed like the creator was a d-bag.  When you read the synopsis, he built a real castle for his daughter - who he had abandoned 15 years before.  Sure, it sounds like he had some redeeming moments when he contacted his wife and kid that he had left without a word and passed on his money to them after he finally kicked it, but the guy had an elaborate bar with a \""wishing well\"" (which was pretty clever) so people could order their drinks downstairs and have them brought upstairs, because he hosted a lot of parties.  Just, you know, without his wife and kid.\n\nIt would have been nice to go on the tour when Mary Lou was still around, because she's the one I actually find interesting in the family.\n\nCool experience, but the thing my husband & I talked about most afterwards was the dad who left his daughter when she was 4 years old and thought about her from afar."
4,"Service is good! But I have definitely stopped going as much since they raised the prices, and the food quality has gotten worse."
4,"Ah, Parc Jean Drapeau, the memories...\nWhen just dating my hubby, we'd spend an hour everyday after work walking and talking, getting to know each other at this park.\nThe beautiful trails, the vast places to sit and relax and all the events that occur there it's just a great Montreal landmark and for good reason.\nWhen you want to have a nice day outdoors and not leave the island just head out there and enjoy."
4,"I would give them a 5, but there's the one thing - I'll bring that up later.\nFirst of all, they gave us WAY too much food for our dollar. Not complaining, but man, a lot of food. The carnitas were the best we've had in a very, very long time. The carnitas were crisp in places, spiced just right, with a perfect texture. Last time I had carnitas that good was about 8 years ago in Mexico. The tortilla was so hot and fresh. That, alone, would warrant 5 stars. The service was friendly and fast. And, they're open 24 hours. These guys are walking distance from my hotel. Perfect!\nMy one and only complaint is that the taco shell of my taco was overcooked and too hard. But, everything, everything else was perfecto!"
4,"My husband and I have visited Minecci's many times. We have not sampled their pasta dishes, what we have had is tasty. Our go-to is lightly battered cod topped with marinara sauce and a few kalamata olives. It could do without the breading, but it is very good nonetheless. Soup has always been good. Salads are plain, but serviceable. The one gripe I have had with their food is their veal parmigiana. I thought it was pretty cheap for veal and there is a reason for that. It is ground meat, not a filet.\n\nThe atmosphere is certainly dated and a bit dim, but I think it feels like a little family restaurant. The decor seems to be in good condition. It is not meant for an urbanite's night out, just a comfy spot for a low-key date or small family celebration."
4,"OMG! This place has SO much stuff and a really big selection. I would've probably bought alot of clothes here but I already did alot of damage at the outlet stores. The women's selection is huge and the ones in SF do not even compare! This place is crowded and noisey. I didn't like that one of the cashiers only accepted credit or debit cards because it made everyone else paying cash have to wait longer. Unlike SF, they have pulling baskets and not actual shopping carts. I feel sorry for the person who has to clean up the mess at the end of the day."
4,"I've dined here many times and enjoyed the food each time.  I do believe the restaurant is family owned, just by the variety, recipes and staff.  The restaurant menu is actually Italian/American cuisine.  If you want prime rib, pork, seafood and a caesar salad, you can have it here and be assured it will be as good of a choice as the Italian offerings. \n\nI usually go Italian, only because it is why I am there.  I need to get more adventurous.  The linguine with the king crab and crispy leeks with lemon butter sauce is so good!  My husband always enoys the \""traditional\"" spahgetti and Kobe meatballs.\n\nService is great and decor is spectacular.  They have the largest wine list I have ever seen and a huge variety of cocktails.  This is one sexy restaurant."
4,"Found KJ kitchen with  fellow Yelp member's review. It was our first time there and overall the food was simply outstanding! We ordered Pork Belly, Oxtail with red wine and pork chop Cantonese style. All the dishes were delicious including the complimentary soup and dessert! The restaurant was very crowded when we walked in around 7.30pm and we waited for a while for the food to arrive. Still, our overall enjoyment of the food was very positive! Will return but probably either earlier before the dinner crowd or after! Great food that did not disappoint!"
4,walking through the airport on way to gate. Thinking about the nasty food I'll likely eat when I reach it. Pass by Blanco. Angels singing with ray of light. I've been to the location in the Tucson hills. Its consistently great food. What a nice surprise in an otherwise awful food environment. Way to go Phoenix airport. Fish tacos were a solid choice.
4,The people in there were just great to us. In particular the RN in the cardiac unit that helped me (Morgan) was so cheerful and helpful he really took the edge off of being there. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because of the facility. Yes an older facility will be a bit worn but things that are fixable should be. The hinges on my bathroom door screamed at all hours of the night (and others did as well) and the water faucet shook the whole room when turned on due to air in the lines. Both of these could be remedied with a maintenance person in there for less then 30 minutes.\n\nAll in all though both my wife and I have been admitted to John C. Lincoln and we trust them to take good care of us when needed.
4,"Great company to work with and very affordable prices. Lots of inventory to choose from as well, almost too much :) We did our whole downstairs with wood laminate as well as new baseboards which turned out great. They were very honest people to work with & we will be using them again when we do our upstairs."
4,"First Las Vegas Ramen I tried and I liked it.\n\nHad their spicy tonkotsu ramen bowl and it was quite good. Also tried their fried rice and gyoza, both were not bad. No complaints. I actually the price was cheaper than bay area places.\n\nWill go back to this place when craving ramen in Las Vegas. Maybe try their Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen next time."
4,"Mesa delivered beyond my expectations. Everything was very flavorful and did not disappoint. The ribeye, jalapeno cornbread, all delicious. Good for large groups too. We came during restaurant week so they had a really good 3-course prix fixe deal for ~$56."
4,"I have been here since I was a kid. The thai food is F A B U L O U S! The only problem is that they really should waive the extra rice fee of $2.50 if you have four or more people. But other than that, this is the BEST thai food in Las Vegas and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone that wants to try something new or any good thai restaurant."
4,"It was good. There were a variety of options to choose from. In a great location and easy to find. Wasn't blown away, though."
4,"The bartender is amazing.  The entrees are amazing.  What I did not like was being charged $15 for sashimi that was have the portion and double the price of my local sushi restaurant for quality that was half the quality.  If i am going to be charged that price for sashimi I expect to have the finest fish available.  This was not the case.  The lamb belly is out of this world.  I had the rabbit dish another night, but wish I would have had the rabbit first and the lamb second as nothing compares to the lamb."
4,"Went for early dinner on a Monday, as my kids were hungry and kids eat free on Mondays. The hostesses seemed to be hanging out and after reading reviews I was sure I was in for horrible service. Got seated very quickly though and our waitress was over in less than 2 min to get our drink order. The whole meal service was great, she wasn't bothering us every 10 seconds but made sure to check everything was ok or if we wanted refills. A man came over in plain clothes and asked if everything was ok, we said yes. A few minutes later he snuck up behind me and grabbed my empty cup and asked if my waitress was getting me another beer, I informed him I didn't want one. I assume he was a manager but he should have said something or a name tag would have been nice. Overall good food, and good service.  \nOh, and happy hour is long there 11am -7pm Monday- Friday."
4,"I would understand how someone can hate this place... mainly the long line that wraps around the place. It kind of remind me of the Indiana Jones ride at Disneyland. Too bad I got a Fast Pass! Thanks to some lovely connections... we walked right pass the line! I could not afford to wait in that line. I was told some people were waiting since 10pm and they barely got to the front of the line! Eeks! \n\nAs we entered this place, the devil inside me came out! Not literally! This place is very inviting and let's you lose all sense of sanity. I normally don't listen to house music. In fact, the music annoys me. Something about this place that just made me want to jump up and down! And that is what I did! \n\nThis place is huge, so the capacity can hold PLENTY of people! The people are all about having fun! The night ended early morning with my feet ready to die on me! XS you have been great to me!"
4,"I have nothing but great things to say about the Mac Shack! High quality pasta, fresh vegetables, and a friendly staff! I ordered carry out this time and even after the drive home the food still had great flavor! \n\nGreat vegetarian options!"
4,"Of all the newfangled \""FroYo\"" places, this is the one I frequent the most. Of course, that is mainly due to the proximity to CenPho & their \""twitter Tuesday\"" special. They have consistent flavors & toppings. I am a creature of habit, so I stick to the cookie monster with tiny little peanut butter cups. Yes, tiny PB cups, so cute! My experience has been that the price is a little higher than the competitors. However, I follow them on twitter and only go on Tuesdays now. They have a \""secret\"" word that, if whispered creepily, gets you 1/2 off the price. So for two frogurts, me & the BF spend about $5. NOT TOO SHABBY."
4,"Overall is a good place to eat. It's a tasty sandwich for a cheap price, specially considering the location.\nI had the all American sandwich which I liked but didn't loved because it had cranberries on it. My boyfriend had the cannonball and loved it."
4,Matt Goss previously at Palms hotel and casino. \n\n\nI saw Matt Goss when he was performing at the Matt Goss showroom at Palms hotel and casino. I have not seen him at Caesar's Palace hotel yet. I can guarantee that show is just as phenomenal if not even more fantastic. \n\nHis stage presence is strong with his powerful sensuous svelte voice. He sure can dance as well and he loves his audience! His band is great and can sure get down. Having his sexy lady dancers on stage does not hurt either. I found myself singing along with him and moving and grooving. \n\nThe moment I get the chance I will be checking out his show at Caesar's Palace for sure! \n\nSuch a sexy show! The music is pure sex!
4,"wasnt sure what to expect from this place being that it was in the Plaza hotel, but food was good, i had a poke bowl and the wife tried the seared ahi plate and both were very good. Still when it comes to poke, their sister location Poke Express up on Craig rd, is the place to go"
4,"Wasn't sure what to expect but it was not cheesy, which I really appreciated. They are funny, a little political, and they do neat illusions.\n\nBefore the show, there's a guy on piano and one on bass. The bass player is an unassuming Penn. There's audience interaction throughout the show. Afterwards, Penn and Teller meet and greet people as they exit until every last person gets a chance for a photo or autograph, which I think is really, really nice."
4,"Beso is located in Crystals shopping mall next to Aria. First of all, good service. We were seated promptly and immediately given the wine list and everything came out very quickly. Surprisingly quick. Beso ranges in the upper $20s to $50s for entrees so with tip and tax you'll be paying about $75 a person if you want drinks and sides.\n\nWe ordered the oyster shooters (they're not alcoholic) and there were very good. I preferred the tomato gazpacho oyster shooter. \n\nFor entrees we had both the tuna and the salmon. Both were wonderfully prepared and the portions were not small. You have to order sides separately, but they are very large sharing portions. The wild mushrooms side was $11 and way too large for two people to consume. \n\nSomehow we had room for dessert after seeing the dessert menu. The churros were simply amazing with a caramel sauce and creme. I still don't know how we managed to eat all six of them.\n\nThe bathroom is upstairs are requires taking an elevator and walking through the night club. There's an outside patio seating area as well as a dining room. The dining room is not too large and the booths are comfortable. Our table had a nice view of the Aria's fountain and even New York, New York's fake Empire State Building, so if I squinted just right I felt like I was back home eating at the W's Zylo Steakhouse."
4,I always have a great time. \n\nHuzzah !\n\nIf you love the sun and happy people then this is the place for you.\n\nThe price to enter is a little spendy but for a full day of fun and people watching it is worth it. I suggest this festival and all it has to offer.
4,"Wow!  I was introduced to this place by my friend who is a local in Vegas.  She asked me to ride the free shuttle out here from the strip, mainly because driving on the strip is so nasty!  So I rode out and met her at Sam's Town.  I must say, I was quite impressed by the interior of this place.  Very western feel to it. \n\nThe place itself is huge!  It has 2 floors of gambling, and a huge movie theatre!  I ate at the buffet here also.. the food was impressingly good for the price!  They have a different food theme every day of the week.  I was there on Saturday, which happens to be Prime Rib night.  I did not know there was a bowling alley there too, but I'm going to come here next time I am in town!  \n\nI definately liked gambling here much more than on the strip.  I never win anything on the strip.  I gambled at Sam's town for at least 2 or 3 hours, but I didn't lose a dime!  I came out positive!  I don't know if I was just lucky or what.. but the machines were really generous to me!  Also, the cocktail waitresses come around quite often!  It was really a great experience.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll be taking the shuttle back to Sam's Town!  =)"
4,"I have had a membership with Massage Heights for about 9 months now. I will probably never do it again. I like this place, but I work at a resort on the strip and they add more to the experience. It is always the little things such as the extra pampering, water and healthy snacks before and after. I know that my place of work doesn't offer a membership, but it is worth the money everyone once in a while. I will completing my 1 year contract\nOf massages with Massage Heights, but will not do another membership with them since I feel for what I pay for I can get better service elsewhere."
4,"I am also somewhat conflicted about Tram's.  I have been a few times now, and it seems to be somewhat hit or miss.  I've had the Pho a few times, and while always fairly good my satisfaction largely hinges on the amount and freshness of basil and mint that is brought out.  The other dishes are usually well made and well seasoned.  \n\nI enjoy the short menu and the waiter who is fun to interact with.  This place is usually pretty busy even on a weekday evening.  Surprising given the location.  Definitely better than Pho Minh up the street, but I still think Spice Island has the best Vietnamese dishes in town."
4,"This is my first time trying this place.  Love it. I use don't care for Asian food, but I will definitely be coming back."
4,"I am always skeptical when I visit a Thai place because I love massaman (mussaman, etc.) and find very uneven results across the Thai restaurant landscape. I've had salty-as-hell massaman, nearly-raw massaman, and flavorless massaman.  I gave this a try.\n\nThis was Very Good Massaman. The potatoes were actually cooked through. The shrimp still had the tails on them, which I hate, but they were good. The sauce was tasty (though somewhat  reminiscent of tomato bisque soup). I really enjoyed that dish.\n\nThe decor was pleasant- wood everywhere, not overly crowded with tables. The floor didn't look as if it had been swept for a couple of days, though (sorry, Pin Kaow- that evening sun shows everything on a smooth shiny surface!)\n\nI tried the rice and coconut ice cream for dessert and was not impressed with the rice, as it was gummy.  I'll come back for more more massaman, but no dessert for me."
4,"wow, this place is pretty delicious.  i came here in a large group and was able to try a bunch of things.\n\nfor apps, we got the fois gras, spicy crab salad, and the tuna tartare.\n\nfor dinner, i ordered the \""surf and turf\"" which was not your standard surf and turf.  the \""turf\"" consisted of a huge chunk of fois, and the \""surf\"" was a pc of butterfish.  all of it was on a bed of shredded brussel sprouts, and there was a black truffle sauce on top...completely decadent.  i tried some other dishes and side dishes too, including the creamed spinach, the gnocchi, and the lobster au curry.  the creamed spinach was fabulous.\n\nfor dessert, i tried the chocolate souffle, mix candy bar, and choc and praline bush.  the souffle was the best dessert, and it came w/ a side of pistachio ice cream.  yum!"
4,This place has always been a favorite of mine.\n\nAll you need to know is that their Gyros are the best I've ever had.  The lamb meat is so tender and and the z sauce is perfect.  The are $8 but they are big and tasty.\n\nYou can also get a nice combo with fries and a drink for just $2 more.\n\nGive this place a shot.  It feels like a small ma and pop shop (but I don't know if it is corporate or not).
4,This is a great places to have happy hour with friends.  I enjoy everything here from the atmosphere to the drink specials and sushi.  They offer a variety of fun martinis and have good happy hour prices on sushi and nigiri.  It is also fun to enjoy your meal while sitting at the sushi bar and watching the chefs make your food fresh right in front of you.
4,"If you want a good, interesting burger in Las Vegas... this is the place.  Good, crispy fries (including sweet potato and oxtail chili!)  The burgers are nuts-- the Bahn Mi and Kalbi burgers are my favorites.  Haven't tried the \""wagyu and foie gras\"" burger yet.\n\nOK, here comes the maybe-not-so-good stuff.  It's kind of a strip mall feeling.  Because it's in a strip mall.  And... the meat isn't the best burger meat I've ever had.  Kind of tastes frozen... or just CAFO-beefy.  Not bad, but not particularly beefy. They definitely focus on dressing up the average burger meat well.  \n\nBut, they do that.  The burgers are great, and the beer selection's particularly good for Las Vegas, where most places seem hell-bent on serving Lite Beer or Blue Moon and that's all.\n\nWorth a drive and a bit of a search to find if you're anywhere near there."
4,"Visited this place from out of town and I'm glad I did. The scene was a good mix of people (it was a Friday night) and the service was prompt. The bathrooms were not as disgusting as some have stated ( I have experienced much worse) and I will definatly visit again. Also, the drinking out of the mini pithers was interesting, I think I spilt more on myself and on the floor than I did in my mouth haha."
4,"So many good things to say about maggianos food. One of my favorites is the  chicken Alfredo it's so tasty. I have tried a number of different dishes and this will stay number one. The chicken francese and potatoes are also good. The customer service was on point, the maitre'd Loray had is seated quick, our server was awesome aswell."
4,"Cheap, tasty, filling.  We tried the pho, spring rolls, and lemongrass chicken; all were well worth ordering again.  This was, however, my first Vietnamese meal, so my thoughts are necessarily less discerning.  \n\nThe owner is indeed a character, and he more or less ordered for one of us.  Luckily, we're pretty easy going, and generally happy to take a proprietor's advice on what's good.  He struck me as amusing and endearing rather than abrasive.\n\nThe place was packed, though we went at 7 on a Friday.  Given this and the fact that they take no reservations, it'd probably be a hassle to go there with parties larger than 4."
4,Seems to me like this restaurant is a hit or miss.  I have eaten at this restaurant on many occasions.  Sometimes it's excellent.  Other times not so good. The salad bar is always excellent. I've even stopped in and picked up a salad to go. It's only open for dinner so there's usually a crowd if you go early. The people are very nice so it is worth a visit.
4,"I really like George Street, it hosts some of my favourite shops; Cath Kidston, Penhaligons, Coast and Karen Millen and a massive Paperchase to name a few. Even if some of those shops are more for window shopping than a usual shopping spree. In addition all the swish shops there are also a lot of great bars and restaurants too.\n\nOn a summers day it's great to walk along George Street, most of the shops are housed in gorgeous buildings and it isn't as hectic as the likes of Princes Street where crossing the road is like having a near death experience."
4,"Not much of a vegan food fan but decided to try it on whim. Things you do when you are far from home.\n\nThe staff was very friendly and the surroundings have a bohemian feel. Visited at night on a weekday. It was fairly full.  I ordered the jerk tofu salad to go. I really enjoyed the taste of the dressing and the flavor it infused in the tofu. The only thing I found odd was the following:\n\nIt seems they are interested in reducing waste and polution. they packaged  my salad in cardboard packaging instead of styrofoam,they provided a wood fork  (which shows they are onboard witht reducing waste and care for the environment) but they put it all in a plastic bag. (I guess the SurfRider foundation rise against plastics campaign has not reached Tempe yet). Overall good change of pace"
4,"Bask In the Ambiance Bask in the Ambiance. Plenty of seating. I prefer to sit at the bar so i did. A Few tvs with sports on while your rolls are being made. They have happy hour on the weekends though i Opted for all you can eat. The rolls that arent included in AYCE are only 99 cents which is a score. I must say HONEY ROLL HONEY ROLL is where its at. Also a 1/2lb of crab legs with dinner all you can eat for 9.99 that cant be beat. \n\nThe rolls come out fast and fresh. Not to much rice either. Im a fan of the Rainbow roll as well. The service was a little slow to remove my plates and keep my drink refilled in the beginning but they made up for it and then some. Once im on this side of town in the future and want Sushi i know where ill be going for Lunch. Also they have Kobe Burgers on the menu which seems more than appetizer to me, so they would probably put me in a food coma. Love the ingenuity of the names and ingredients with the rolls. \nKudos"
4,"#aroundchandler So I finally made it here. So much hype about this place. Now I don't consider myself your average wing eater. I eat a serious amount of buffalo wings. I even made it to state championship for a wing eating contest. The wings here are good. The wings them self are average, but the sauces are way above average.  I always judge wings based on the standard hot. The hot was fairly hot, but very tasty. I also tried the ATL rub. The flavor was fantastic. I'm not a cool aid drinker, I stay away from sugar. But the fact they had cool aid I thought was pretty cool.  I will be a regular here and will try all 18 flavors of wings!!   #chandleraz"
4,"We went for lunch. The best thing about this buffet is the many stations, each a different type of cuisine, so lots and lots of varied choices.  Its weakness is that while some of the food is quite good, some is not.  Nice thing about a buffet, is you can just stop eating anything that turns out to be not so great and go get something else.  Standouts according to family poll on this trip were cold and hot jumbo shrimp, coleslaw, cornbread, Italian chicken stew, bok choy, carne asada, flan, and chocolate mousse cake."
4,"The only reason there is not five stars is that its a little confusing to order and hectic and the last time we were there the tables were not bussed.  The food is very good, novel idea and fresh ingredients,  I love that you can order and get a great pizza in a short period of time but they still need to work out some of the kinks and then it will be a really great place to go"
4,"I have to admit - I'm a huge fan of this ampitheater mainly in comparison to the ones in the DC area. It was really easy to get to, easy to park and easy to get in and get seated. \nBack in July, I went to see Dave Matthews and had a GREAT time, mostly because of the venue. They were pretty lenient - you're allowed to bring in food items as long as they are in one ziplock bag. I did that instead of getting screwed by the vendors.\nAll in all, I was just grateful not to have to wait 3 hours to get to the ampitheater and then another 4 hours to get out (Nissan Pavilion, I'm looking at you). \nLoved it!"
4,"The reviews were NOT exaggerating when they mentioned SLOW service. It was terrible. However, when the steak and eggs did come... Delicious! But it took 20 min at least."
4,When trying to think of where to go for a steak dinner The Greentree Inn came to mind. I had never been here in all the years of living so very close. I was glad I chose this establishment. Food was excellent and I loved the feel of the place
4,"It's nice to see a chain that is committed to doing something and doing it well. We have a local Habit restaurant here in California. On a whim, we decided to drop into one near our hotel in Phoenix last week. Both my wife and I ordered the same thing we always do--mostly to see if the experience was consistent. Well it was. Consistently yummy, might I add.... If you find yourself in Chandler with a hankering for a great burger, I highly recommend the Habit.\n\n4 out of 5 stars for the food being a little on the pricey side for the amount that you get. But who am I to quibble, we'll still be back."
4,"Mmmmm....GREASY goodness...I mean dab it with a napkin and it's still covered in grease kinda good slices here! \n\nI was craving some pizza and wanted to step out of the big chain places so off to New York Pizza I went. It was pretty busy for a Wednesday night. But I was able to order in no time, just one pepperoni slice....and it was less than $3 so that's a win.\n\nThe inside is quaint. It's a couple of table and chairs, booths, tvs...nothing fancy.\n\nMy pizza actually came up pretty quickly and I was out the door in no time! \n\nThe pizza crust was good, there were plenty of pepperonis, cheese...and of course grease! The sauce had a little kick to it, but it was not overwhelming and I liked it. I agree with Ben G, it's a different \""kind\"" of NY style pizza...but still very tasty! \n\nI look forward to trying their wings and fries and subs, when I was waiting for my order someone had ordered the philly cheese and it looked delicious!"
4,This place rocks! Can dine inside at a booth with TV or on the patio w/ your mut! The aju sliders are delish!
4,"Two Words = Great Service.\n\nEveryone is super nice at this restaurant and that in itself sets them apart from many restaurants in Vegas.\n\n1 star = Quick assembly line, and every one behind the glass is super nice and friendly. What a great way to start a meal!\n\n2 stars = The owner introduced himself, let us try some meats, and made sure we were enjoying our meal! Now that's how you handle business and return customers!\n\n3 stars = Kalua pig flavor = bombtastic. Explodes in your mouth with flavor and does not taste anything like a fast food staple. \n\n4 stars = COCONUT BARK = to die for. I wish this restaurant was closer to home so I can always have a refill on my coconut bark. They are $3.50 a bag but so worth it and it comes with a lot. But definitely hate to share, so get your own! Haha!\n\nLacks the 5th star only because my tacos and fiance's burrito was tearing apart as we were eating them. Must be the strategy in wrapping and filling that needs to be worked on as the restaurant is fairly new. But all in all, great place for fast food, chipotle Hawaiian style goodness!\n\nThat coconut bark though! Ugh...it haunts me!"
4,"It was a quick trip downtown from Mesa, I didnt like some of the people getting on the train but hey its public transport. My legs were also hurting from the seats on the short trip downtown I have RLS and man it hurt for days after. It was great for saving gas and if I worked by one I would take it daily. This was my first time so watch where you park by the pickup locations cause I got my car towed, $200 fine!!! I would take it downtown again but park in the right spot this time."
4,"Talk about a great way to watch the game. Went to BWW to watch the World Cup and couldn't have asked for a better experience. TV's everywhere airing the World Cup in addition to key baseball games! Great service, wings and Beer! The waitress was extremely personable and fast, even with all the tables she had to wait on. The wings (boneless) were tasty, and the blue moon beer I had made t the perfect combo. \nI recommend trying the fried pickles as an appetizer....on point!\n\n-Joe"
4,"We did the wedding helicopter package and got married on the night tour over the strip. It was AMAZING! We sat right next to the pilot and the view was so spectacular it felt like we were flying the plane ourselves!  \n\nThere was the option to add a photographer and/or video of the ceremony. We added the photo package and were very pleased that we did. He took tons of shots and it was a great memory. Since the same guy who takes your pictures wil be the one who does the video we said \""no\"" to the video since we didn't see how he could do both things at once. I'm so glad we chose that. \n\nOne thing I would recommend is to make sure the microphone on your headset works before you take off. No one could hear me on mine and I had to say \""I Do\"" about 10 times before they could hear me. Fantastic experience and anyone who is wondering about getting married this way will be so happy!"
4,"Ah...another Charlotte staple when choosing a ultra gourmet and romantic evening.  This was my first visit to the Fig Tree and I was very excited to see what it was all about to say the least.  I had already decided on my entree before even walking in the door so I was all set.  Thankfully, my girlfriend with her grand ways made reservations during the same time they were decorated for Christmas so the atmosphere was just perfect for us.  I ended up getting the grouper that came laden in a butter sauce with lobster meat that adorned the top.  It was great!  The cheese plate we had prior was good as well but may be a bit overpriced at $17.  My girlfriend ended up getting the pork chop entr\u00e9e and wasn't pleased at all with the preparation of the chops as they were a bit too fatty....shame.  I later tried the chops and I would have to agree they weren't exactly fat free but I soldiered through it anyway...ha!  The service was impeccable and delightful and the whole experience (all be it a little downtrodden due to the chops) was good enough to have me back again"
4,"I do love Dunkin Donuts..... specifically the Toasted Coconut and Chocolate Frosted cake. :)\n\nPretty much 99% of the time I get the Coffee & 2 donuts combo (of course the Toasted Coconut & Chocolate Frosted cake). \n\nI used to go here WAY too often -- so often, that they know it's me when I order at the drive-thru. Cause I get the \""Toasted Coconut & Chocolate Frosted cake\""..... \n\nAnd seriously, I have to say that everytime -- cause for a long time they would mess up and give me a chocolate glazed donut or chocolate frosted glazed donut - - def not the same. \n\nFriendly staff. Make sure you get the coffee punch card if you order alot of Medium-sized coffees here..."
4,My husband went for lunch with a co-worker yesterday and they enjoyed it very much. Keep up the good work.
4,"I like the large selection of tapas.  My husband and I tried many several different plates, 1-2 from each section.  Favorites are deep dried artichoke and the foie gras.  The deep fried beignets (bunuelos) were delicious!"
4,"Great little shop! Walk up,outside seating and the inside area is great! Staff is friendly, coffee is good and the pastries are a delight! - I don't usually use that word."
4,"Went here tonight on a date with my BF.  I was pleasantly surprised with the atmosphere, service, and food.  All the ingredients were fresh and yummy. The Chow Mein was the best I have had in years.  The staff was very friendly and attentive. \n\nI would give the one sushi roll, Golden Cali Roll, we got a 3.. it was just ok. The BF liked it more than me."
4,"Didn't really feel welcome. However, the roast beef sandwich with blue cheese was outstanding.  Probably one of the best sandwiches I've ever had."
4,"Love the taro yogurt and mochi balls! The only down side is the lack of seating and the fifty bajillion college kids that swarm this place. Maybe that's just the old woman in me, but this place gets really loud! I definitely like it here better than Mojo's so I'll take my yogurt to go and enjoy it in peace!"
4,"We stayed at the Golden Nugget 6/29-6/30/13. First time staying at this or any hotel Downtown. Our Rush Tower suite was nicer than our suites in the Palazzo where we normally stay. There were many factors that really could have hampered our stay - 117 degrees....lost money....brought my 10 year old...pool was packed.....BUT....We had an amazing time!!!! The staff here is very attentive. Their clientele aren't flashy nor trashy. The table limits are perfect. The food is good. The room rates, food rates, drink are very reasonable. The pool is so much fun!!! \n\nMy wife never takes the time to reserve a spa appointment in advance and regularly gets a annoying response from the big hotels when trying to get a same day appointment. She made a same day appointment for a pretty big ($200 treatment) and said the spa in the Golden Nugget was very good and a good value!!!\n\nShe actually wants to go there with her girlfriends but I think maybe my players card room discounts are not transferable to her\n\nDo not be afraid to venture out 'Downtown' Vegas. We ziplined and watched the free concerts.\n\nReally can not wait to get back there!!!"
4,"Moved close by and went here for the first time loved it, Kay is awesome she's really good but time efficient at the same time which is very hard to find sometimes. Normally I get someone at a different salon who is slow but does good or someone who is fast but not good she is the perfect blend of both. Very pretty salon with beautiful pedi bowls and massage chairs. Not over priced and quality work, big selection of gel colors to choose from and comftorable setting! I give it a thumbs up and will be coming here from now on to see Kay."
4,"I've been coming here for about 2 years! Their shrimp fried rice is awesome! It is located right next to my work, so it is very convienant for me. Love the service here! Very fast and friendly! Their lunch menu is also cheap and delicious!"
4,"I ordered the yellow curry with chicken and it was so delicious! I would have given 5 stars, but the egg roles were pretty greasy and flavorless."
4,"Our Via train from Toronto to Montreal arrived an hour late due to the train staff's failure to close a door at one of the stops. As a result, we arrived in Montreal at 11PM thirsting for some alcoholic beverages, and maybe a bite to eat. \nAfter quickly dropping off our luggage and cleaning up, we walked down to Old Montreal to find the perfect place. It took us about 20 minutes of either places closing up shop for the night or simply tacky tourist dives serving nachos before we found the Merchant. It was crowded at midnight and still serving.\nService was a bit slow as we were adjacent to a large birthday group that was just breaking up and asking for separate bills (another conversation entirely!). The host realized the problem and began taking care of us; we had sparkling water quickly and a bottle of red soon after that. We decided to share the beef carpaccio and Cesaer salad appetizer, and it was delicuous. All the food we saw looked delicious, it's a fun rowdy atmosphere, and the DJ was playing great \""old\"" music from the early 90s. \nWe liked it so much we returned the next night for drinks after the Killers concert. This place is popular and I can see why."
4,I had some issues with Cox years ago but I stuck with them. The last couple times that I went in there I had great experiences. They worked with me to lower my bill and were quick and helpful. I'll give 'em some props for that.
4,"Let's be clear, I like what the AZ Humane Society does and I think their Campus for Compassion is a mind boggling awesome facility.\n\nMy only problem is that out of the three times we've gone to visit they were... out of dogs.  It's entirely possible we have poor timing or that their adoption program is so fantastic that the dogs fly out of their kennels but... it was still rather strange and I couldn't help but wonder if their kennels are being under utilized.  \n\nBut that's all just idle speculation and perhaps a plea for them to get more good dogs out of the county shelters and into the air conditioned, classical music playing comfort of their Campus for Compassion.  I have no doubt that once a dog gets into one of these places he is well cared for.\n\nOne thing I particularly liked about their design was that there was a low wall separating the two rows of kennels in each building.  I think that seems like a fantastic idea for lowering the animals stress as they don't have to stare across the hallway at some pissed off dachshund all day.  It also means that getting dogs too and from their kennels isn't as big as a deal because there is only one row of barking dogs they have to worry about.\n\nAnd yes, it's probably the nicest shelter I've ever heard about."
4,"I couldnt wait to get back to a Smashburger after having my first one in Vegas. I got the Sincity burger in Vegas and they dont offer anything like this that i saw here. :-(\nSo i deceided to get the Arizona burger and it was ok, if it was my first smashburger i wouldnt be craving it though like i did with the sincity burger. So now i still have to wait for that crave."
4,"I can't believe I haven't updated my review!\n\nLo Lo's I had been craving you!!!!! Ever since I had a bite of your fried chicken I have been hooked, and I don't even like fried chicken!!! \n\nThe combination of your fried chicken and waffle just can't be met anywhere else, I even have to say I like I like you more than that Roscoes down in LA, ooooowwwwweeeee just can't get enough!\n\nI ordered the #8, the betty boop, which is a waffle and fried breast, and omg its still has good as the 1st time I tried you, I swear I will try other numbers, but when you already had perfection its hard looking for something else!\n\nThe Kool Aid is still on point, cold & in a jar, love that stuff!\n\nThis time I did try the mac & cheese which was perfectly cooked and just the right about of cheeseyness to it. \n\nThank you Lo Los for yet another perfect meal!  Oh and ladies,,,let me tell you EYE CANDY forsure!"
4,"I walked in and got a pedi, staff were nice especially the two women. The place is cozy, however I guess it's spring that's why it was quite hot. Anyway, it's awesome they have a wide selection of polish! These chairs with back massage available is so cool! Price is reasonable, I got a basic pedicure at $20. If I'm not mistaken, some staff can speak Mandarin. Cool! Will definitely be back."
4,"Darkest bar in Charlotte! No need to clean up the place just keep the light down extremely low and no one will see the bar scum on the floors. II don't think its that dirty but seriously I don't really know for sure because they keep that place like a damn cave, even in the middle of the day! This Irish Pub is pretty cool though, two bars on two floors and an outdoor seating area partially covered so your covered for the summer time thunderstorms  on sunday funday. Corn hole is set up out on the patio which can help pick up your a portion of your tab if your competitive and into gambling. The bartenders were friendly and the mood is more laid back and chill than other bars downtown. Peak hours can get pretty packed but the off hours are good for kicking it and catching up with some old friends."
4,Very hometown feel in this place. I came here to check out the open mic they have on Thursday nights. And it was great environment and cheap drinks! Great combo!\n\nCan't wait to go back!
4,"The bf was so excited about all of the flavors he had seen on the website but was :( when we arrived and there were only about 5.  So his rating is about 3.5.  He said his coconut custard was really good.\n\nMy rating, on the other hand is a solid 4!  The Western is a sure fire winner.  Those salted pecans rule the school!!  I wish I had some right now!  I was worried it would be too much as we were still stuffed from dinner - but it was delicious.  Much lighter then ice cream...more like frozen yogurt but creamier.\n\nThe area is well lit so don't be too scared.  Those pecans are worth dodging a bullet for!"
4,"Though I find it slightly pricey for what you get, the food overall is very tasty and I wholeheartedly recommend the Kabob Grill to anyone who is a fan of Mediterranean food. The tabbouleh, potato harra, shawerma, and lamb kabobs (succulent and melt-in-your-mouth good) are particularly worth mentioning. The pickled condiments are excellent too, with a great spicy vinagery taste. The hommos, served with flatbread, is good, very smooth, though I personally prefer a little more lemon. The meat pies and grape leaves were fair; I'd like a little more spices/flavor. They also have a nice selection of wine and beer, including some good, heavy Ukranian (or Baltic?) brews that I haven't had anywhere else. They frequently have coupons in the Ballantyne magazines."
4,"What a cute little place to have breakfast! \nI just recently attended a bridal shower brunch here and it was so cute!  \nThe food was super tasty, I had the creamy corn porridge with maple glazed sausage and cinnamon sugar roasted apples. I took a chance on it, it sounded like it had a 50/50 chance of being either really good or really heinous! And boy was I glad when it came out and was soooo good! \nThis place could be 5 stars if the staff wasn't so lax and a little more attentive. This was the whole table (8 ladies) first time coming to this place, we were not instructed that drinks were self serves for the basics (water, coffee, juice) we had to figure that out on our own, and no one at our table was asked if they would like a mimosa or any other drink other then the self serve stuff. \nI do look forward to going back!"
4,"Felt like an nice apartment complex. Rooms are very spacious with couches, dining table, sink, and big bathroom. The rooms are fairly cheap in price, got mine for 25 a night. Drawbacks? The rooms do look a bit outdated, kind of stale and not much to look at with a small TV. Yes I understand its a few blocks away from the strip, but I am reviewing the hotel and wont knock it down for that."
4,I was pleasantly surprised with my visit to Joey's. Super cute restaurant and great service. They start with really yummy corn bread muffins and my mom and I each had a different kind of chowder - both were great! The entrees were generous and we both really liked ours. I'd definitely recommend giving it a try and I'm looking forward to going back again.
4,We split a milk chocolate bar with smooth peanut butter inside.  We really enjoyed the smoothness of the peanut butter filling.  Luis commented that it tasted like a Snickers without the peanuts which for my generation would be a Mars bar:) Our cashier/clerk Antrez was very nice and professional.
4,"The restaurant is fairly new and located in the ground floor of a old Bond Warehouse just off Constitution Street.  They have made use of the double height ceilings and put in a mezzanine level, creating a small area ideal for large groups of people and providing more table space.  We received a warm welcome and were seated at our table near the large arched windows.  The interior is clean, simple and especially liked the candles in red coloured glasses dotted up the stairs.  Giving to space an almost zen-like feeling.\n\nAll the staff were authentic Spaniards which felt reassuring.  I love tapas and so this restaurant did not let me down.  The menu is broken down into 3 sections, 'From the orchard', 'from the sea' and 'from the farm'.  We ordered 6 tapas between the two of us, wondering if it would be enough? Thankfully it was plenty, the dishes were small but tasty.  Do try the pork and mushroom cream sauce and Monkfish, prawn and squid in tomato sauce.  First time I've eaten squid that isn't rubbery, it just dissolved in the mouth, lovely!"
4,"This place was a nice find in the Scottsdale area. The area is chain ridden, so you could pick any number of places. I saw the decent reviews on Yelp and gave this a try. We sat on the back patio, which was dark, but gave a nice romantic atmosphere. The food was very good, as well as dessert. Wait staff were friendly. Overall great experience!"
4,Best chips n salsa. I wanna take the whole bottle to myself. When I have parties  at home I order the Fiesta platters. Everything here is good. Only reason I gave 4 stars n not 5 is cause one time I went in n they ran out of Pollo fundido. Gave me a regular chicken burrito. I was looking forward to fundido. Anything fried is better right? Fast service..clean restaurant
4,"Artsy place with a cool vibe. My wife and I went there for a nice lunch and that is exactly what we got.  I really like the contrast of flavors that we had in our sandwiches. Mango, cajun chicken, and avocado --MMM!! Delicous!"
4,"I go here all the time because I have a bunch of friends who work in the kitchen. It's all good stuff.. I have tried most of the pastys. I love the Reuben, the Cajun, and the Royal (all horrible for you) I recommend swapping halves with a friend so you can try 2 types. Good beer selection."
4,"Love the food here!  I think they have the best fried rice ever, and love that the vegetables and meat are large pieces and not chopped into teeny pieces.  I almost always get the Mussaman Curry and it's some of the best I've ever had.  My second favorite is the sizzling beef, although last time I had carry out the meat was tough and way overcooked.\n\nThey handle special orders with no problem, although every addition costs $$.  They used to run a spice scale of 1-10 with 5 being comparable to jalapenos, but have since changed it to a 1-5 scale with 3 being the old 5.  My biggest complaint here is that twice now they've reversed the spiciness of the dishes ordered.  Once when I ate in my curry had no spice and my friends had so much spice she couldn't eat it.  Of course they fixed the problem for us right away.  The second time it happened was a carry-out order and it was too much of a hassle to return for the correct items.  Can't see why this should be so difficult to get right.\n\nThey have a discount card of sorts, accumulate points based on dollars spent and then earn $10 off a purchase.  I also recently received a 20% email for being in their \""loyalty program for a year\"".  \n\nI'll be back soon!"
4,"Was visiting the Scottsdale area on vacation this past weekend and was looking for some good sushi in the nearby area.  I found this restaurant on Yelp and I'm glad my friends and I decided to go.  We had such a great time!  We met the owner Greg and the sushi chef Miki.  Not only was the food great, but so was the service and atmosphere.  I would highly recommend trying this place out."
4,"Great patio! \n\nCame with a group of friends and had the pork plate with yummy little Johnny cakes and the wasabi mashed potatoes, both were excellent."
4,"Excellent meal. I had the Mahi Mahi and my wife had the Salmon, which were both awesome! The service was quick and friendly. Looking forward to going back to try something different!"
4,Sheer coincidence that I'm writing a review for Cheba hut on 4-20. But where else should you go when you're blitzted out of your mind on 4-20 and you want a hot toasted sub? EXACTLY!!!
4,"Great place to relax, grab a bite to eat and a drink in downtown Phoenix.  The staff is extremely nice and helpful and there are many options to choose from here."
4,Un-be-freakingly good steak. Incredible! Service was a tad slow but I'm American so maybe I'm just not used to French service. I'd definitely go back next time I visit.
4,"Interesting concept. This place is quick-service, order at the counter, sushi restaurant. You go in, place your order, pay for it, and then they bring it over. You fill your own drinks at the machine.\n\nThe sushi was fine. It was nothing special but the prices are great and the service was very fast. If I lived or worked around there, I could definitely see myself going frequently."
4,"I love this place the next day after a hangover.  Actually, I love any type of Pho the next day after a hangover.  The Banh Mi (Vietnamese Sandwiches) are cheap and tasty here even though they're a bit smaller than some other places.  The Pho and almost everything else is better than average except the spring rolls, not that they're bad.  You can also order a variety of boba drinks here.  The only small problem was that they sometimes pretend they understand what we're saying, but they end up getting the order wrong.  Little things like no cilantro or more of this and that."
4,"Go here frequently, and have never ran into any of the issues other's have yelped about...\n\nBest rolls\nVegas\nDamn good\nSpicey cowboy/cowgirl\n\nI like sashimi...but unless I'm someplace where it just came out of the water...I'm not eating it...so can't comment on that.\n\nWe usually go late in the afternoon and have always had good service and once we had a birthday party with 15 people on a busy night..\n\nMy Only complaint is the bathroom...it needs some work.....and I do not like hearing employees talking on their cell phone while sitting on the toilet."
4,"You're getting an extra star for two solid reasons.  \n\nOne is because the remodel is over and the store is pretty again (and a bit fancier).  Two, and thee most important part, this iggle has the best quality and well made sushi out of any Iggle's out there!  Believe me, I've eaten many a rainbow roll from many different locations around the Burgh and nothing has compared.  Dare I say, it's as close as you get to going to a good sushi restaurant.  Bold statement, right? \n\nI  just love me some sushi and want it often, quick and convenient and this serves all those purposes with upholding the quality.  Need a quick sushi fix?  This place is it!"
4,"This is a diner and should be treated as such- the service is hit-or-miss, the atmosphere isn't anything special, and everything on the menu is pretty good. A few tips for enjoying all this place has to offer: \n1. Share a malt or shake with someone- they are delicious and HUGE, so way too much to eat with the well-portioned meals, but half of one is perfect and satisfying.\n2. Find something that you like on the menu and stick with it- there are a number of exceptional things on the menu (i.e. the Meatless Meatloaf), but everything else is average.\n\nI'd probably give this 3 stars, but the amount of vegetarian options is fantastic and deserves another star."
4,"The pepperoni rolls here are awesome! You get six 2\"" diameter rolls here with dipping sauce for $6.49 so they are a little expensive but they are well worth it. They also have Woodchuck hard cider on tap which is very good as well. Their deep dish pizza is OK. It would be better if they cut the huge chunks of sausage up into a little smaller pieces so it could be spread across the pizza more evenly. I have not tried their thin crust pizza or other menu items at all. Last time I was there to pick up a to-go order of the pepperoni rolls, the person waiting on me was very friendly and took the time to describe the various dipping sauce options and the available drinks they had."
4,"Food, service, and ambiance were impeccable.  The only negative on our visit was the horrific lounge singer who proceeded to butcher multiple Beatles songs to the extent that I'm sure the deceased Beatles (RIP!) were rolling in their graves.  Fortunately he stopped at some point throughout the meal.  Sooooo on that unappetizing note, let's move on to the food...\n\n\ncalamari - unbelievable!  Delicious, tender perfectly cooked and seasoned calamari with a great accompaniment of shallots, asian noodles, carrots, scallions, cashews, and red chiles in a lovely sauce.\n\nhalibut cheeks benedict with lobster and Hollandaise - delicious.  perfectly cooked biscuits (says the Southern girl who knows my biscuits), the hollandaise was well-done - not too stiff, not too heavy, and perfectly cooked eggs.  The little side salad with it was just ok.\n\nlobster bisque - delicious.  Not too creamy, lots of lobster flavor goodness, pleasing texture.\n\nasparagus with hollandaise - tender, fresh baby asparagus \n\ncorn - amazingly fresh and flavorful.  It was hard to stop eating it.\n\nbananas foster butter cakes - a bit too sweet for my taste but everyone else loved it.  The butter pecan ice cream was divine.\n\ngodiva chocolate cake with vanilla bean ice cream - Oh.My.Goodness.  Were licking the plate not frowned upon (in some places,) I would have.\n\nWhitehaven Sauvignon Blanc - lovely, light, fresh bouquet.  Kim Crawford lovers will enjoy it.  \n\nfrom the moment you walk in the door, it's all about quick, efficient, professional service.  Everything we had was amazing. Definitely a great place for a special dinner."
4,"Free is good - especially in Las Vegas - and every hour along Fremont Street you get to hang out and watch a show of some sort take place overhead.  I've always enjoyed downtown, first because the hotels are so much easier to get into than on the strip (where you have to walk miles to get from one to the next), but also because it's just so much seedier.\n\nThen to see all the neon shut down and everyone stop and stare - it's just more interesting that people, who are dropping who knows how much money, will care to watch the lights twinkle for five minutes or so.  At the end of it all, you get to watch the street flicker back to life, and everyone goes on with what they are doing.  It's just an interesting phenomenon, less about the show than about what takes place around it - and watching the people is what it's all about."
4,"Having moved here from Ohio, I was looking for a good massage therapist. After reading on Yelp about Jill I gave her a try. She did a wonderful 90 min. massage. Her knowledge about stretching muscles daily was very helpful; holding a stretch for 40 seconds was new to me. I now go for a massage every three weeks, always looking forward to an excellent experience. I highly recommend Jill to anyone for a great relaxing massage."
4,"Steve Wynn set out to have the best buffett in Vegas, and he does. The Wynn buffet definitely takes the cake. The quality of their ingredients and preparation is a step above the rest, and it's apparent in everything from the thin-crust brick-oven pizza to the huge, meaty crab legs to the New Zealand rack of lamb. I also appreciated the little \""exotic\"" touches, such as the Asian noodle soup bar, fresh longans (not canned!) and Asian pears in their pear salad. \n\nMinus one star for that crazy long line, though...we waited for 1.5 hrs, and believe it or not, many people waited longer. Someone in line behind us even fainted and one kid got a nosebleed. Damn, people! With the Wynn buffet being a quintessential Vegas attraction in and of itself, Steve Wynn should consider implementing a FastPass type of system!"
4,Not easy to find. In the back of a shopping center. In went there for Pho all the time. It's the closest I can find to the noodle I had home in China.
4,"I really like arrowhead mall, its one of my favorites. the layout is very helpful and you can see other stores from either side of the mall and all have easy access. I like the fact that it also has an Apple Store. My Favorite Stores are American Eagle And Footlocker. and for my wife they have all the rest... so she can go crazy shopping. it keeps her busy haha...and when we are tired of walking. they have alot of restaurants to choose from :) so this mall has it all...and its close to where i live so i dont have to drive out to AZ mills or fashion square mall...unless we are bored...then the drive out there will be worth it"
4,"Maybe my expectations haven't fully evolved since entering the VA system but so far, after two Dr. Appointments 2 visits to the lab and today's visit with a nutritionist,  I am impressed.  No significant waiting.  Painless needle sticks.  Wonderful volunteers.   While it took a very long time to finally get into the system, so far I have nothing but good things to say about the staff and service.   The VA here serves a huge population and seems to be very considerate of patient needs.  Thanks guys for your care and attention."
4,Deals were found thru out. Its good to see more booths were staffed then not. It's all new stuff so if your looking for pre owned or tools go to the outdoor one. It's a dollar to get in. The mini donut Booth is gone but plenty of places to eat are open. Security is present so don't try it. It's goof to come here on hot 100 plus degree days. Grab a smoothie and wall around.
4,"This place is really nice.  I feel seriously spoiled when I try to go out in SF or in Sacramento because nothing I've been to seems to even come close to topping XS.\n\nXS's biggest and best feature is its size.  Plus the entrance (as you approach the opening of the interior of the club) is really really impressive, especially since it opens out into the pool area and expands around it into a pennisula around the pool.  \n\nHowever, I went during memorial day weekend and the place was PACKED. I've never seen it so busy there and was a bit of a turn off that it was so packed inside.  I went on sunday (not saturday, saturday was stupid crazy and the cover was ridiculous; plus we got in for free on sunday).  I think Keri Hilson was there singing her songs but she sounded so off I think the they told her to stop performing (?) \n\nAlso the music there tends to vary a lot, if you're used to listening to hip hop/ pop music at a club, XS will do that but on occasion it'll do a quick switch to some house music and totally throw most people off guard."
4,"Let's start by saying that the service at the registers was extremely friendly... AS IT SHOULD BE WHEN YOU ARE PAYING 500X MSRP! The staff was friendly, courteous, and thanked me for my business. The theaters were ok, took the kids to see TURBO with a friends family. This theater could definitely improve cleanliness of bathrooms and theaters,but the service gains them 4 stars"
4,"I have one word for you, son.\n\nPorkbellies.\n\nSpecifically, GRILLED Porkbellies.\n\nWith a side of rice, a side of pickled eggplant, a side of macaroni salad, and a side of cucumbers.\n\nIt doesn't get much better than this.  (crunch, crunch, crunch)"
4,"Good music, strong drinks, and that rooftop terrace is definitely worth checking out, even if it does get a bit too crowded for my taste (hence 4 stars instead of 5.) Getting in was no issue, and we weren't charged any cover. \n\nAlso, pretty cool that it was connected to the Playboy Club via one giant escalator."
4,"While the food here is good, and the service very friendly, the menu seems somewhat limited and isn't as exciting as I've seen in other places.\n\nThe food is good, clean, and reliable.\n\nWhile it was during the week, the place was absolutely empty around 1pm.\n\nWhy aren't here more people here?"
4,This is my favorite airlines.  They have a very reliable on time record.  The planes for the most part are clean.  I really enjoy riding the air bus.  I love the early morning red eye flight as one could possibly go to vegas and then land in HNL and still make it to work. (well if you are hard core LOL). \nThe food if even offered on your flight is no frills.  Its not the best and nothing really much more to say but its exactly what first comes to mind when thinking of airlines food. If you know what I mean.  \nThis should be the first airlines to check out if flying out of LAS to HNL and vice versa.
4,"After a late night of dancing and gambling... where better to feed the tummy than at the California Hotel.. I think more specifically the Cafe.\n\nTheir menu has lots of choices but I only come out this far from the strip for the Ox Tail Soup! and I am not the only one... when you glance around tables they are mostly filled with giant soup bowls and the accompanying bowl of rice.  \n\nIt is a bit far from the strip.  This past time I went the cab driver dropped us off in a sketch area because he wasn't sure where to go.... In my past experiences the taxi driver's usually know where to take you. \n\nThe ox tail soup is huge and filled with lots of meats carrots and celery.... sometimes a few floating mushrooms. It is always more than I can finish but always hits the spot, especially in the winter time when it is colder out.\n\nI haven't gambled much here but their tables are on the cheap side.  Yay low table limits! it means I can stretch out my money longer!"
4,While I am not the biggest Mexican food fan on the block I have always enjoyed eating here. They have this whole Greek/Mexican marriage thing going on-lol. What I really like are the chips and salsa. Interestingly enough their Veggie Burro is kicking!
4,"After going to Gordon Ramsey's Pub and Grill the night before, this was 100x better. We got there right at 11 so we wouldn't have to wait for a table. This place is clearly popular and there were 10 parties waiting at 11 already so if you have to wait a long time, it should be no bearing on how you rate the restaurant. There were lots of tables, lots of staff, and when we left around 12:30 the place was teeming. \n\nOur server was very knowledgeable, she explained the menu and gave us her recommendations. Her service was great and she kept checking in on us.\n\nThe burgers were delicious - no complaints. We got the sweet potato fries that we could barely finish as there were so many. This place was priced very reasonably considering that it's a Vegas restaurant. For $13-15 a burger, you can't really complain.\n\nGreat place and we're sad we didn't get to try the shakes."
4,"My husband and I always enjoy Hef's. The atmosphere is cozy, yet usually hopping and exciting. The clientele is usually quite diverse. Their fried tomatoes are delicious and the drinks are good. Great neighborhood bar."
4,"At the car wash\nWhoa whoa whoa whoa\nTalkin' about the car wash, girl\nCome on, y'all and sing it for me... \n\nWith 17 valley locations and 2 more coming soon, Danny's Family has quite the business!  They must be doing something right, because there are always a ton of people working and a ton of cars being washed when I stop by...\n\nI am guilty of waiting a LONG time to get my car washed, but it's always the best feeling to get into a clean car.  Danny's brings me that satisfaction.  They do a good job.  Not amazing, but much better than I could do on my own, and much faster too!  \n\nI also just learned that Tuesday is ladies day at Danny's... at least that's why when I looked at my receipt for my car wash, I received a $2 discount.  Note to self - go get my car washed at Danny's on Tuesdays from now on!  I guess being a 'lady' does have its perks sometimes; even at the car wash!"
4,"Although it is in a strip mall and the interior lighting is a bit dark, it is cozy, casual, and the food is comforting.  If you have a group of four or more, you may have to eat al fresco and opt for outdoor seating at the front.  Also, there is a small counter space where you can eat and watch them make the crepes at the same time.  I ordered the Frisco crepe which had fresh blueberries in lemon curd sprinkled with powdered sugar and whipped cream on the side.  It was perfect with my all you can drink morning coffee, but I would have wanted a little more lemon curd in it.  It's a great place to try your first crepe or when you want to get out of your usual breakfast comfort zone and broaden your taste buds.  It's FUNtastic!"
4,I wanted a good burger and got it here. It was cooked to order. Staff were nice....not jerks and not trying to rush you or pressure you. I really liked the onion rings and options for your burger.
4,"There's a rule in my family. When you buy a house, make sure that you can walk to a liquor store. This comes from the need to keep stocked in winters where you might not be able to drive, leaving you and your family shut in for a few days, disgustingly sober! Oh the horror!!\n\nI can walk to Mike's. It's a small place but lacks nothing.They have an excellent wine selection, fully stocked distillates and a good selection of beer ...  all reasonably priced. No pretense, nothing snooty just a good selection that won't break the bank.\n\nLast summer, when it was so hot, I was looking for some vinho verde. Vinho verde is a light, dry, somewhat fizzy and citrusy white wine from Portugal that is great summer drinking and, most importantly when drinking heavily, it tends to be cheap. He had a really decent one, on sale for $5/bottle!! More than reasonable! \n\nI've walked way further for way less. Way to go, Mike's!!"
4,"Very fresh ingredients. Authentic Italian recipes. To me the decor is very authentic as well. This place delivers too, and fast! I agree that the garlic bread on the hoagie bun isn't the best but the have countless awesome items and I haven't even tried them all. I also didn't like the fried zucchini, but only because I prefer a thin zucchini filet instead of the large chunks.\n\nThe Italian Beef is Amazing! Loved the fettuccine Alfredo. I think I like the Sicilian pizza is one of my favorites of all time. The mattarocca  on it is sooo yummy!"
4,"This is a really great hotel.\n\nPerfect location on the Royal Mile: you really can't ask for more - aside from the very steep hill that you have to climb from the train station. I had a perfect view of Arthur's Seat from my room, which encouraged me to get out and go see it.\n\nInteresting older architecture, with a crypt-like bar area. The room was very nice, especially since it had a Nespresso machine in the standard room: a Radisson first for me. Bed enormous and super comfy. TV not great though - the reception was poor and even though the technician came out to take a look, they couldn't make it any better.\n\nThe reception service was extremely good, I asked for a restaurant recommendation where I could sit quietly and enjoy a nice meal with my book without being harassed. They fully understood, took me through some options, and then called the restaurant to reserve me a table. Awesome!"
4,"much MUCH better then the first time we stayed here when it just switched from aladdin to planet! im glad i gave them another try.  \n\nso the girls and i got the \""hollywood hip\"" room for one nite for 159+tax=180$.  that was a 2 queen non smokin room on the 17th floor. we also got comped a free bottle of liquor of our choice which was a $45 skyy vodka bottle + 40$ casino play & various other coupons.  the room was nice &biiiig w a 42\"" plasma for us to watch jersey shore while gettin ready & a bathroom with a tub, shower, seperate toilet & 2 sinks and vanity areas for us girls to get ready!\n\n+ they left us the paper & a bunch of OK magazines to read\n\nthe biG downer of the room is they need more lights!! the girls and i HATE dim rooms and there jus wasnt enough lights for us. plus the bathroom gets super stuffy/hot maybe because of TOO much light! \n\nanother BLAH tho...one of the beds had some stains left on but it was 5am and we couldnt bother to call room service...that is a lil gross...haha but all in all enjoyed it =)"
4,"Nice big suite at a competitive price. 10 minute walk to both the basketball arena and the baseball stadium. Right smack in the middle of downtown with plenty of bars and restaurants literally a few feet away. No new to rent a car of drive your own, everything is near. Can't wait to come again during season."
4,"Great find! Had the beef arepa, was pretty good, I also had the chicken salad one, wasn't great.. but what I really loved was there grilled chicken with rice and beans.. delicious!! I have to try the empanada next time, they looked great!"
4,Love their adult milkshakes otherwise this bar is subpar. The atmosphere is like any other bar on saddlebag trail with a lot of speakers.
4,Jim and Tabitha are excellent bartenders!! The Wednesday comedy night is a great time and the food is pretty good and priced just right.
4,Since my last visit they got rid of the uncomfortable but pretty chairs and replaced them with comfortable cushioned chairs that are slightly too wide to fit the tables.\n\nWe started with Summer Rolls. They were much larger than I was expecting and also far more delicious than I was expecting. The beef inside had this delicious charcoal kind of taste and had very fresh vegetables around it in a rice paper wrapper. The fresh mint inside made it very refreshing and perfect for a hot summer day. The roll was also served with a light fish sauce.\n\nI had the Spicy Stir-Fry. It wasn't as spicy as I was expecting but it had a nice kick to it. The white meat chicken was developed with flavors and was prepared very well. This dish had a wide assortment of fresh crunchy vegetables in it that was covered in a very balanced sauce. This WAS A VERY GOOD Dish and possibly one of the best dishes you can get anywhere for $7.25.\n\nOut of all my visits so far I haven't been disappointed with anything I ordered from here. \n\nI like that they offer many different things that I don't notice at other Vietnamese Restaurants.\n\nThe food seems very solid from here.
4,"Wow! The portions here are way more generous than I had expected. \n\nNot to sound like a total cheapskate but the prices had scared me off of Fuego Bistro for a long time. The menu sounded great and I came for lunch and LOVED my Cuban sandwich - A LOT - but dinner seemed steep. \n\nCame for happy hour and had a top notch mojito and enjoyed delicious sliders. Still, for dinner... I wasn't convinced. \n\nI saw a Groupon but the conditions (must buy 2 entrees) didn't earn any points for me, personally. My friend, however, had a Groupon and suggested we meet here for dinner. \n\nHoly mole! The dinner portions are HUGE. No wonder the prices are what they are. You can easily share an entree - or take home left overs. There must've been a dozen shrimp on my plate. MOUNDS of pork on the other. You get to choose 2 sides and they're all wonderful. \n\nSo, to put an end to this long story... do NOT let the dinner prices scare you off. The food is delicious and you get your money's worth, not just in the quality but in the quantity too!"
4,"On our 1st anniversary trip to Vegas, we checked out Margaritaville located in Flamingo. We had the tacos and flavored margaritas which were nice. It was very festive inside with live music. Had fun. This place is recommended for families with kids"
4,"The best Vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas in my opinion. They are always crowded especially during the weekend. All of their food is authentic, the portion is big, and my family loves it. Although we always got our order really quickly, the service is not very great there. They had a lot of waters/waitress on the floor every time I was there, but they either ignored us, or tried to be busy on other things else that were not really  important. Well, I don't think it is a big deal because their food is so delicious."
4,"This is a toy store for adults. I'm not a big drinker, but walking in and seeing rows upon rows upon rows of every wine, beer, champagne, liquor, and spirit I have ever heard about all in one incredibly well-organized store with a friendly and helpful staff to boot? That's something that makes you hear the hallelujah choir.\n\nI first must say that I fell in love with an amazing beer in Albuquerque last year, and have never found it anywhere else- until now. Alien Stout and Nut Brown Ale? SO GOOD. Also found the Wells Banana Bread beer here, which is even more fantastic than it sounds.\n\nThe wine selection here is intimidating, and I browsed but did not focus my attention on that section of the store this visit. But I'll be back for the Dreaming Tree crush red and Barrymore Pinot Grigio.\n\nNo alcohol store would be complete without an amazing selection of glassware (including those plastic travel wine glasses to take your favorite bevvie alfresco!) and snacks- including a selection of refrigerated meats and cheeses by Boarhead and some more lowbrow options like chips and snack mixes (which tend to be quite pricey here).\n\nIn short, everything you need under one well-organized and friendly roof, for your alcoholic beverage consumption needs! I am very impressed. The Lee's in the adjacent plaza can just start packing up- this place blows them out of the water."
4,"Great staff/coaches but the viewing area for the parents is horrible.. It is almost impossible to get a seat..it gets 2 crowded and most of the time you have to stand to watch, especially when your child is enrolled in a 2 hour class.."
4,"Visited Root twice in the last few months. The first time our experience was fantastic, it was not crowded or loud but had a great ambiance. The highlight of the experience was actually our server, who we chatted with for an hour about beer and our love of food and places we've been. The food was also fantastic and we really enjoyed their wine list.\n\nThe second time was more of a two-three star experience. The food was decent. The first trip we had brussels sprouts that were excellent, while the second time they were burnt pretty badly. The rest of the meal went fine, but our server this time around was rather off his game and did only came and asked how we were, took our order and brought our check. He seemed, honestly, seriously stoned. So, for us, it was hit or miss on the two times we went. But it is definitely a highlight in a great neighborhood."
4,"Update - 05-March-10   They improved the parking system finally.   Good job guys.   \nAlso, kudos to the field workers.   After a spirited rainstorm right before Saturday's race, they worked hard to get the track dry so the race could start.   Good show."
4,"This is the only acceptable pizza I've eaten in Pittsburgh. Having tried 11 other pizza places in delivery range of Oakland, there is no contest. When I feel nostalgic for a NY slice IVP is the only viable solution."
4,"good food, good prices and good atmosphere - all adds up to more than just good. try the \""unnumbered\"" lunch special....13 bucks gets you a whole heap of tastes!"
4,"We were looking for a reception site for our wedding that was laid back and would give us more time to actually mingle with our guests.  We decided on Bahama Breeze, and it was great!  The food was fantastic!  Our reception was at 9pm so we did the appetizer buffet for about 25 people, and everyone loved the food!  The atmosphere was light and fun, and I think everyone had a good time!  The only reason I only gave it 4 stars was because a few times throughout the night the staff would come up to me and ask me what to do or what needed to be done, and I kind of felt like it should be their job to already know what should/needed to be done.  Other than that the staff was very friendly and we enjoyed ourselves!"
4,"Their food is amazing. The tatami rooms are just add ons to the whole dining experience.  The unagi bowl is WORTH IT. A little pricy but all sushi places are. If you get tired of buffet, definitely try this place."
4,"A Groupon deal made this a really good value. I thought the portions and quality made the regular price at least fair. On my second vist, the portions were a little smaller. I think the non Japonese sushi chef is a little less skilled and a little less gernerous. Overall, I am happy to report a good experience."
4,"Sunday at the park with solin.\n  we went to spring valley park after searching for dog parks on the Internet and this park had the best recommendations. There are three fenced sections for different dog sizes. so I went into the small one since solin is  a poodle. (dropped at my doorstep) the area is very large' there were a lot of dogs and people at that time, large enough to throw Frisbees for dogs to chase. there's also a water fountain for dogs and dogie bags, not the ones you take home, this are supplied for your convenience so you can clean after your best friend, so please do so! \n  solin  had a great time! he went crazy all over the park like a kid in a candy store. he couldn't mark this place enough, I worried he would dehydrate.\n  hey! stop it! (my dogs' smelling another dogs butt) \"" don't worry \"" said the owner of the other dog, as she went on telling me  that that's the way dogs get to know each other. \"" The smell tells them everything about the other dog and they know right away if they're compatible based on the aroma.\""  Are you serious! I been using e-harmony! .......and she walked away....\n\nGreat park for dogs."
4,"I suppose there are both pros and cons in having a pretty solid Mexican restaurant right up the road from your home. The obvious pro being the accessibility to great food and drink (generally Dos Equis or Modelo for me), followed swiftly by the obvious con of un-doing your exercise routine for the day. \n\nBut in any case, I generally enjoyed this restaurant with the exception of cost. In the grand scheme of things, it isn't necessarily pricey. It is generally comparable to other Mexican restaurants. For me, if I'm looking for a quick, around-the-corner Mexican restaurant- this is definitely the place to be. If I'm looking to penny-pinch, I'd drive a few minutes down WT Harris towards the university and hit up Zapatas (my absolute fan favorite). \n\nI generally liked every other aspect of this establishment. The atmosphere and d\u00e9cor were set perfectly for a Mexican restaurant. Good ambiance. The food was well prepared and was pretty delectable. Beer was flowing. The service was spot on. What more can you ask for really? \n\nThere were specials here, which most looked appealing. \n\nDefinitely worth a try!"
4,So I found this great little restaurant on Yelp during one of our many Vegas trips and I have to say that I am in love with the french toast sandwich!!!! I'm a huge fan of savory and sweet and this place nailed it to the wall!! Great place to have breakfast after dancing the night away on the Las Vegas strip! I just wish I lived closer because the food here is amaziiiiing and totally crave-worthy!
4,"Ooh, nice! You know somewhere's ok when they deliver your friend a drink with a clockwork monkey on a string. Chessboard floor, plenty of seating, nice downstairs by the looks of things and an efficient, if taciturn, water.\n\nWhat I really liked was that the instant anyone arrived, the waiter appeared with a weeny tumbler of water to drink while a harder option was decided upon (or not-so-hard, in my case).\n\nThere's not much in the way of a written menu - just a price list with names and prices, so you'd have to enquire. I think the idea is you pick one - like a lucky dip, hence the name. That's my guess anyway. I requested a mocktail and was asked not what kind of flavour I'd like, which is the usual question, but what I'd like to avoid. Heh. Interesting. No bananas, please, I say, and off he zooms to create something for me.\n\nWell, full marks for the not-banana. It definitely didn't have any of that in it. Also no coffee or lamb, so we're on a winner here, folks. All the same, it didn't knocktail my socktails off; it seemed to me more like just bitter lemon with a mint sprig. That said, it was very mature - not that sweet and fruity - and lots of lovely crushed ice to play with afterward. Also, it only cost \u00a33.50. Huzzah!"
4,"I am on jury duty twice a week for 4 months. ( I am retired and it gives me a chance to see a part of Phoenix I have not had reason to visit. Each day I have eaten at a different place. \nCartel Coffee Lab is more than coffee. They also serve breakfast and lunch. Not sure about dinner. \nI would call the decor and lay out as trendy but I really don't pay much attention to decor. \nI decided on the BLT. On ordering it I was informed that there was an egg on the BLT and was that OK. I spent several weeks in Canada and there is a chain of restaurants by the name of Tim Horton that serve a BELT. (Beacon, Egg, Lettuce, Tomato.) So My answer was definitely that is OK. The sandwich I had was very good. The lady that waited on me was extremely nice. After finishing my sandwich she came over and asked me how I liked it and spent some time just talking to me. Great Customer Service.\nWhy not 5 stars? I usually have to eat a couple of times to give out a 5. If get to eat there again and get the same great service and food I will revise my score to a 5.  If you are down town. Go see them I know you will be happy with their food and service. \nI will try their expresso next trip and I feel it will be good also."
4,Staff is really nice. Rooms are adequate. The pool is really large and has waterfalls...and was clean when I was there. I didn't have to wait for anything. Lazy river was neat. The restaurants on site are spendy...but tasty. Great for pool fun w kids.
4,"After inhabiting this earth for 27 years, I finally had the pleasure of experiencing Korean BBQ for the first time ever in Vegas of all places.  We left our $10 dollar beers behind @ XS and decided it was time to loosen the belt buckles at D.J.K.  A couple of awesome Koreans we were with guided us through the menu...ok, that's a lie...they ordered for us but I'm so glad they did!  You must must try soju-strong Korean liquor!  It really enhances the food.  Also, if you're in from 11pm-2am you get 20% off your bill!"
4,"this is the best Italian place in Vegas thus far. the pizza is great but the dinner entrees are awesome. I've taken family and friends here from out of town and they have loved it. the chicken Marsala is my fave, I've had the shrimp Alfredo, all kinds of pizza, and foccacia and its been a hit every time. if your ordering pizza for delivery good luck with the girls on the phone, they're like 12 so its hard to get the order through but delivery is fast and the food is really great. the prices are great too!"
4,"Oh yeah.  I was there in the late 90s and loved it. \nMy first trip back to Charlotte in 15 years and this place was my first stop. \nExcellent meal, especially the crawfish appetizer.  No way I wait that along again before getting back out there!"
4,"Great concept, basically as much toppings you want for $12.\n\nThe pizza is the perfect size for 1 person too. The crust is nice and thin. So you can easily finish this by yourself without feeling guilty of eating all those calories.\n\nI was glad to hear that there is another branch in Hillcrest, San Diego. So I will definitely stopping by that restaurant as well.\n\nAgain, the pizza is good. Good quality, and choose your toppings or just go for their standard menu, all for $12 per pizza."
4,"Great tacos and really cool scene! I travel to TX a lot, and thought these tacos were just as good (if not better) than what I seek out when I'm there."
4,"THIS PLACE IS PERMANENTLY CLOSED???  Last time we called was summer of 2011 and the voicemail said that the restaurant was closed for the summer.  It is no longer summer and the place is still CLOSED!!!!  Too bad because of my previous review below...\n\nGreat outside sitting area, good food too!  The AC gets a bit too cold sometimes but if you say something, they will turn it down.  This place looks classy, nice decor.\n\nVery good lunch selections under $10.00.  The service is good, they take very good care of you.  We asked for something on the dinner menu and they served it to us.  They have a good wine selection but we haven't tried it yet as my coworkers and I go there at lunch.\n\nTry the spinach dip.  It is awesome.  Small salad plates are good and healthy.  Pizza is good, sandwiches are creatively put together."
4,Had a homemade waffle cone with Almond Joy ice cream.  The servers were friendly and the ice cream tasted good.  Pretty much what I'm looking for when it comes to dessert.  Will definitely be going back the next time I visit my boyfriend here in the Burgh.
4,"went here for lunch with Rand H. and it was pretty good with about 40 or so items it was like one of the typical Indian buffets in size. The soups egg drop and hot and sour were both really good,I had a bowl of each.The main dishes were all done to perfection , five stars for most of them.Well maybe all of them. They were a little weak on the dessert items though. They had jello ,sliced peaches and those little white balls i think there called lychee. Anyway it was a great lunch at a good price $5.75 the service kind of sucks or they could have made 5 stars but because the food was so good i give them 4."
4,"This review is only for the crepe I had...it definitely satisfied my crepe-craving and sweet tooth! It had nutella, whipped cream, caramel, chocolate sauce, bananas, and candied hazelnuts. There is no possible way to have a bad day in Vegas when you start off breakfast like this ;)"
4,"I always enjoy the food and drinks here. The place has a nice decor and good outdoor seating on the strip. I've waited to review until I've been here more then twice, lastnight was my third. Everytime I have no complaints with the food, all delicious. But everytime service seems slow, they are actually lucky I came back after my first time here. But the food and atmosphere seemed like it deserved a second chance. My first time we waited 20 minutes just to get our drinks! We had to wave our hand in the air for then to notice! Other times I've visited not nearly as extreme but the waitress seemed a little stressed and confused. Would come back to the table and re ask what it is we ordered. Food amazing, drinks good. Service questionable."
4,"Nicer thrift store, many items to choose from, they got rid of there 99 cent days, and half price/99 sent colored tags. not too much junk. overall a trip worth while, especially for cloths! ;)"
4,"Tonights vacation dinner destination was Bandera, located in Old Town Scottsdale. We heard lots of good reviews for Bandera, and were excited to try it. Bandera is also a sister restaurant to Houstons and The Rutherford Grill (both 5-star ratings from me).\n\nWe got there about a half hour earlier than our reserved time, and enjoyed a drink and the Deviled Egg app on the patio. Our table was ready in no time. We ordered the Grilled Artichoke and Cornbread sides...the artichoke was fantastic. The cornbread was the best I've ever had. For my main course, I ordered the Steak and Enchilada. The 6oz filet was sliced into three small pieces and had a maroon spicy sauce on the side. The enchilada had their signature rotisserie chicken inside. Both were tasty.\n\nThe wifey had the Macho Salad. The salad arrived and for whatever reason, it was missing the rotisserie chicken. They quickly corrected it, and she enjoyed it quite a bit.\n\nI liked Bandera, but it was a touch off. Maybe it has something to do with the Mexican fusion? Good, but not as good as their sister restaurants. 4-stars."
4,"I am rating the massage therapist who did an amazing job working on my knots a few days ago. Her name is Miranda! She is one of those who needs a little warm up to get her to talk. Skinny girl but with such strong hands and fingers! She seems to be knowledgeable about what she does. I will be back to see her in less than a month!\n\nThis branch is clean and most of the staff seem friendly. I can't remember the name of the girl at the front desk. She is nice but very business-like, does not have that cozy/friendly/welcoming type of personality."
4,The theaters are all very nice and still looking brand new. The snack bar has a wide variety of snacks for the little ones. My oldest ordered corn dog bites! The cashier at the snack bar even had it delivered to our theater since they took a while to prepare.
4,"I went there during the \""Montreal poutine week\"" , their brisket poutine was so good, the meat was very tasty, however, the service was slow , we had waited about half an hour to have the poutine and there are not many tables, so maybe takeaway is better."
4,"Wow this place reminds me of the coffee shop version of the boba shop I work at. Strange. We were greeted as we entered AND as we left. Everyone was chill and helpful. The prices were simple (I love it when places round to the dollar) and affordable. I got a soy iced latte, which was pretty darn good.\n\nThe coffee beans they use are very different than what I'm used to...It's more earthy, I would say. I think I like it! The coffee taste is not too strong and not bitter at all, but the drink was definitely not weak or watery.\n\nThe decor is very inviting and I could see myself hanging out with friends, playing one of their numerous board games. However, I came here to study so I refrained from playing with all the little amenities they had.\n\nI wanted to try one of their Yelp-famous grouchy cookies but the cashier said he had never heard of them. Strange...\n\nBonus points for hassle-free and very fast wifi! Too bad this place is so far from my house. Otherwise, I would definitely go more often."
4,The food is yummy and the staff is super-nice! There are so many reasions that Tammy Coe Cakes is becoming a beloved part of Phoenix.
4,Was looking for WOC's and the sales person was really friendly to my surprise. I would def come back here if they have stock.  Better lucky next time for me.
4,"i'm only 5'2\"" and i had to get some low rise jeans hemmed...this place is prompt, does great work, and is quite kind.... Not the lowest price, but well worth what they charge which wasn't much more than a typical tailor.."
4,This place was discovered purely by accident.  I wanted some noodle dish and i was near my old high school I googled good noodle places on my phone...this place.came up...i was like why not just try it for take out...i pulled up and i walked in and looked at the menu...i was so confused...tbey have italian and asian choices...i was like great this place cannot be too good if they are offering two types of food...but i was there already so i was going to try it...i was conflicted i love italian but i wanted asian so i got a staple...pad thai...it was delicious...full of flavor and i was very impressed! Since then i have been back and this place is good...i go here if i am in the area...its super casual...i love to take the food home and eat if while watching my reality tv and desperate housewives show...good place you should try it!
4,"There are not much dim sum places here in Vegas. One of the very few I go to is Orchids Garden. \n\nCompared to the other dim sums I tasted, this one is not bad. They have variety of choices, the price is modest and the place is huge."
4,"Mango, chili, lime, oh my! This pie is awesome. The first bite is strange as it's spicy, yet rich and tart. Go past the first bite and you'll be back for more (if you can handle the spice!). \n\nI enjoy Mama Toledo's!"
4,"We went here for happy hour a couple weeks ago, but before I could even write a review, they were closed! Yep, as of June 2013 - CLOSED!"
4,"Mon Ami Gabi is one of the few places in Vegas that I felt was good value for the price. I had breakfast here one morning and ordered the Blueberry French Toast, and I must say, it was delicious. Large slices of bread, fresh blueberries, whipped cream and blueberry syrup on top. Yum!"
4,"4 Stars for reasonable prices, good food, and one of the managers, Bob for overcoming the poor customer service of one individual, Sabrina.\n\nSix of us were seated at a booth.  When the above aforementioned employee approached to take our order I advised her that my wife and I will be on a separate ticket.  She said that she was not able to do that because we were all seated at the same booth.  I asked that if we were seated at the booth next to this one we could be on a separate ticket, she told me \""yep\"".  I asked what the difference was that we were here and not there, without explaining why she just came our with \""it's policy, and is written right in the menu\"".  I told her then we wont be returning.  Her response is the exact reason why honest working people employed in less desirable positions get a bad rap.  Their mindset is this ain't my place so what do I care if you come back or not."
4,"Dear AMC Rainbow Promenade,\n   1990 just called.  They want their movie theater back.  \n\nYup...if you've been here, then you know that this movie theater can use a make over. I bet back in the day, this was one of the busiest, biggest, and happening movie theaters around.  With all the new theaters with reclining chairs, superior surround sound, and huge screens, it's easy for this theater to lack a little love.  Heck, when was the last time you've seen an AMC 10?  Aren't they usually AMC 20 or even 30's.  But you gotta love theaters like this.  First of all, there's always a deal here and the employees are always great.  And second, this place isn't busy.  Don't get me wrong. I love to be pampered with the huge screens, plush seating, and dynamic audio effects.  But if you're out to just watch a movie, it's the flick and your company that makes an okay experience a great one.  \n\nYELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (045/366)"
4,"Kiddo came in for his Senior pictures session.  We made an appointment and he went into one of the studio rooms in the back and 15 min later came out.  A few minutes after that they reviewed the various pictures & poses, which came out awesome.  They did a great job!\n\nThey had the classic gown photo for the yearbook, but they also took a few pics of poses in street clothes. I wasn't going to buy any extra pics, but ended up doing so because they were awesome.  I'd recommend this studio to friends and family.\n\nReturn Factor - 85%"
4,"I enjoy Encore. It's almost prettier than the Wynn. It's got lots of red and butterflies. I feel rich just walking through it. And there are some great restaurants. It's never as crowded as the Wynn and other uppity properties. The cocktails at the various bars are wonderful. The pool is awesome. Parking is a breeze. But alas, it is still too rich for my wallet. Gaming here is not exactly an option unless you can drop like $100 a hand. But nonetheless, very pretty to walk through."
4,"Omg, best dinner ever, try the meatballs for an appetizer !!!!! It's unassuming how good it was going to be but we will be BAck next time we are in Vegas. Good value as it was not I the casino. I enjoyed the sangria? Although don't sit overlooking the mall, it's very warm by there. Sit inside the resturaunt"
4,"I know people hate this place, and I have to start by saying I don't eat meat. So, I don't know about the kabob, and it does seem a little expensive to me, but I wouldn't really know. That being said, they have lots of other food that's not bad. I've had sandwiches and stuff here (veg of course) that were pretty good, and not as expensive as the kabob. They also have pizza joint food (albeit under another name the address/phone number is the same). The pizza is killer, and super fast delivery even in the snow."
4,"The true eastside contender.  Sakana is a real deal Ayce ace.  \n\nAppetizers like dynamite and nigiri are second to no other ayce sushi joint.  With fresh and oversized cuts of fish.  You have got to give these guys a try.  Rice ratio is still the best feature to this restaurant.  Gone are the no limit uni, sweet shrimp, fresh oyster and deserts.  Those have now joined the ranks of the \""1 per\"".  Sadly there were no uni and fresh oyster today.  All that aside it is still an excellent choice for a man vs. sushi night!\n\nThe fried stuff was great.  The specialty rolls were good.  The star of the show for me was definitely the Super White and the Garlic Tuna.  My meal mates were definitely impressed with the quality for ayce.  Lobster and Popcorn Lobster Rolls had them smiling today.  The Bulgogi was not the favorite for them.  Indulge in the Quail Egg.  \n\nI feel bad for ordering a bite more than we could chew.  It's a mistake giving everyone a turn at the ordering sheet.  They kindly did not charge us for the last 2 rolls that we over ordered..  Thanks guys!  Service will be courteous and pleasant here.  I am willing to restore the missing star in this rating if they have Uni next time we come.  Yes there will be a return visit from us!"
4,"I am glad to know this place has opened under new management. Before this place closed, I would have probably given this joint 2 stars or less. The place was always dirty and would give me the impression that if they don't care about cleanliness in the workplace, how would that translate to their food?\n\nNow that this Burger King is back on its feet, it really seems to have made the turn for the better. The staff is attentive to detail, they are friendly, and fast. The place is also a lot cleaner. I really hope this trend continues."
4,"Consistently better over the past couple years. Hard to give any corporate pizza joint a 5 star rating, but they are definitely a good place to pick up some inexpensive eats."
4,"Based purely on their pastries alone, I would rate it with 5 stars. However, I am not that shallow and shall rate it on more then that.\n\nGREAT lunch! Sit outside and enjoy! Service has always been top notch- helpful and attentive.\n\nA Few of My Favorite Things:\nHummus, Gyro, Flat bread pizzas, and the pastries... sigh!"
4,"I came to Sedona Lounge based on some local knowledge, and it turned out to be a great meal!  It's slightly off-Strip and located in Summerlin, but a quick drive on the 215 will get you there in no time.  It's slightly dim on the inside, but it feels much nicer and more upscale than the menu prices would indicate.  Supposedly Andre Agassi eats here from time to time.\n\nMrs. C continued her string of unbelievable ordering.  She got the cheapest dish, but it was also the best.  How does she do it??  The 3-course menu for about $30 consisted of:\n- chicken consomme, brought out in a fancy teapot and then poured into a small bowl of mushrooms tableside\n-seared scallops with a bacon and mushroom cream sauce\n-creme brulee\nThere are other 3-course menu choices, but that's how she rolls in Vegas.\n\nI got the NY Strip, and college classmate's mom, (who now lives in Vegas and whose suggestion it was to try Sedona Lounge) got the fillet mignon.  Here's the scoop, tho - on Sunday evenings, the steak menu is 50% off!  We got a great deal on a dinner that night!  I would have liked it if i could have ordered a baked potato with my steak instead of the small roasted ones, but that's a minor complaint when you consider the quality of the food being served.  A great deal, but made even better on Sundays!"
4,"Service was great and so was the food.  I now want to open my own \""sliders\"" restaurant after enjoying the chicken parm sliders.  Great selection of beers and several options for tasting flights.  Their deserts looked amazing but we didn't save room.  Overall, great experience and one of the most reasonably priced meals we ate while in LV."
4,I didn't stay here but I came here to walk around and shop! Planet Hollywood would be a really good place to stay at because its kinda in the middle of the strip plus SHOPPING!!! They have sooooooo many stores inside! I love all the lights outside of this place and inside its just so fun! I think I can spend hours inside shopping..=)
4,"Overall I enjoyed my meal a lot.  The food, while very pricey, was delicious though had a few execution issues.  For example, my otherwise excellent beef tartare had two separate beds of mashed potatoes that really didn't make sense.  The striped bass that I had from the specials menu was delicious.  I loved the flavor of the butternut squash tortelli but I thought that the plating wasn't very attractive.  Portions were just the right size, but with most entrees hovering around $50, this is not a cheap night out.  Service was excellent.\n\nA note to fellow diners - please keep your voices at a reasonable level and control your children.  With tile floors and high ceilings, Olives can get pretty loud."
4,This place was great. Good service and great people. The quality was good and service was fast and speedy. \nQuality was nice and fresh. I would have like it better if sashimi was offered instead of sushi the whole time. I would like to taste the freshness of the fish better that rice. \n\nOn that note. I recommend them to everyone that like sushi. the proportions are perfect. Great place.
4,Here it is short & sweet.......GARLIC CHICKEN with xtra gravy!!!! It is the best I have had. Portions are generous and prices are reasonable. The adobo can be on the salty side sometimes but is good. The Adobo Fried Rice Omelet though is........... OOOOOOONNNNNNOOOO!!!! You have to try for yourself. They only get 4 stars cuz they no can make up da mind where dey goin build in CA. Hurry Up!!!!
4,What's not to love! Old town Las Vegas. Tons of lights.\nZipline. Lights. Gambling. Lights. Great food. Lights.\nA must in anyone's lifetime. And can I say this again ... I won here too!
4,We had a wonderful time no problems and staff were very friendly. We tried to extend our stay from four nights to seven but they were booked up solid. Shuttle was excellent with grocery runs and trips to the strip. We will be back !!!
4,"We work about 1/4 mile from this great little spot.  It used to be called the Brown Bag Sandwich shop and I ate there a few times a year.  Since they've been Arizona Sandwich Company, I've eaten there on average once a week, and for good reason.  \n\nAll the sandwiches I've had are awesome.  The bread is so soft, it feels like a goose down pillow.  They hook you up with a healthy portion no matter what item you order.  The sides are delicious and the desserts look amazing too.  (I don't normally do desserts)\n\nWe are greeted by name now when we arrive which feels great.  The daily specials are a no-brainer.  Lately I don't even peruse the menu.  I just go with the daily special and have yet to be disappointed.  \n\nHere's a tip: follow them on FB and you can get a $2 sando if you're hot on the status updates.  \n\nI recommend checking this place out.  It's directly east, across the strees (52nd) from the QT on the corner of University/52nd.  \n\nThe best part, is that I can get in/out in less than 15 minutes.  That really helps for people with very busy schedules.  \n\nSee you there!"
4,"The Times Square Neighborhood Restaurant is a neighborhood jewel. Breakfast is tasty at a totally reasonable price. Dinner of pizza and wings were some of the best we have ever had. A great local restaurant with excellence service, great beers on tap, and authentic Italian food at such a reasonable price. Don't pass this place....it truly is a must try!"
4,"Disappointed in myself for waiting so long to try this gem! \nI stopped in on a Friday evening and was in and out! Super fast service. \n\nI did the build your own bowl. Steak, Rice and Broccoli with the spicy teriyaki sauce. Simple yet delicious. The sauce came on the side and was so good! Perfect amount of spice. \n\nThey have a huge selection of sushi, bowls and salads. Reasonably priced given the portion of food you get. \n\nThe restaurant decor was modern and very cleaned up. Staff was fast, friendly and efficient. \n\nOnly thing keeping this place from 5 stars is the steak was a little cooler than the rest of the meal and wasn't sliced all the way through so when I went to shake the bowl up it didn't separate. I will def be back!"
4,"My Husband & I met some friends for lunch here while we were in town. The wait was about 20 mins, but we were seated on the patio, where there was live music and a beautiful view of Scottsdale & Camelback! I ordered the Market Sunflower salad; blackened chicken, goat chz, bacon, dried strawberry, blueberry, sunflower seeds  & my husband the Smoked Turkey Ciabatta; gouda, bacon,sweet tomato, roasted red pepper aioli. I LOVED my salad, but the hubs was a little less than totally satisfied with his sandwich, however the sweet potato chips were super yummy! I would definitely come back!"
4,"Who would've thought that Las Vegas would be ever known for their sandwiches? Well I believe now they are after tasting \""Earl of Sandwich\"" in the Planet Hollywood hotel and casino. I ordered \""The Full Montagu\"" and it was a hot roast beef sandwich with turkey, swiss and cheddar cheese, lettuce, and the infamous \""Earl's mustard sauce.\"" I opted out for the tomatoes because I feel that tomatoes can tend to overpower my sandwich with it's juiciness at times...too much juice can make the sandwich loose;) Anyhoo, I also tried the \""Earl's grey lemonade\"" and it was pretty good, not too sweet. Most people might say that the best part of a sandwich is the meat or the sauce, but I believe that it was the \""Earl's artisan bread\"" that did it for me. It was sturdy enough to hold the meat and toppings in nicely, yet soft enough to keep from getting soggy. So the next time you are in Vegas and don't want to do the usual buffet, then get yourself a sandwich at \""Earl of Sandwich!\"""
4,"What is there a better way to gain couple more pounds after dinner at Windsor, go next door to Churn!  I was so full after dinner, but couldn't resist the unique ice cream flavors, retro candies, vintage/silly toys, and bakery goodies all displayed around Churn.  My Niece had the Peach and Honey ice cream.  She didn't like it at all.  The pure honey overpowered the peach taste, which sounded good but was too sweet.   I had the traditional butter pecan ice cream sandwich.  You get to select from the baked cookies on the counter and the ice cream flavor.  Unfortunately, the ice cream wasn't frozen so it melted too quickly on a hot summer day.   I will probably wait until it's a little cooler to try other flavors on a pretzel cone."
4,Good but not overly cheap and the service was HORRIBLE.  Servers were polite but couldn't answer questions about the menu or what the dishes we were served were.\n\nWe tried several rolls and I have to say my favorite was the simple avocado roll.  Huge chunks of fresh avocado.  The mixed tempura I wouldn't order again... I was surprised by the Monkey Brains appetizer.  It wasn't what I expected.  It was basically a stuffed mushroom (stuffed with spicy tuna) breaded in tempura batter and deep fried.\n\nI think my favorite thing of all was the Lychee Martini.  So strong and a wonderful flavor.  \n\nI think we will try this place again for the 1/2 price Teppanyaki at Happy Hour.
4,"Great place for our Saturday brunch. Our party of 10 got seated promptly. We sat by the window and a partial view of the pool area and tropical trees, which was nice.\n\nEveryone enjoyed their meal. My sister and I shared the Filet Benedict. They split it for us, which was cool. I also enjoyed the their Bloody Mary. One of the girls ordreded the Exotic Coconut Pancakes that included a mini coconut and mango butter. It was the right amount of sweetness. Very yummy!\n\nGreat place for a low-key yet tasteful brunch!"
4,"I have been looking for a great breakfast spot in my area and I have found it!  Parson's is a great little family owned place where the owner still works with the staff on a daily basis.  The location itself is worn out, but the food definately delivers!  Let me just say this now....  Best Pancakes in town!  No question.  The staff is super nice and the food flys out of the kitchen.  It's a great Breakfast spot, not to be overlooked!  And don't pay attention to Jennifer D's review.....she is from Snottsdale where they really have no idea of what a good traditional breakfast should be."
4,"Fantastic food!  Loved the pho and fried rice.  Ordered spring rolls that never came, even after a gentle reminder.  But we were so satisfied with the entrees, we weren't left hungry by any means.  We will be back for sure"
4,"The only reason I didn't give this place five stars is cause it can be difficult to park near the back of Town Square where the theatre is during peak times. Beside that this place is definitely one of the nicest in Vegas. It is not as cheap as some of the other ones but the nice auditoriums, seats, and presentation make up for the added price. Additionally you have all the bars, eateries, and shops surrounding it so you can do other stuff easily before or after all within walking distance. This is the only theatre I have ever been to that has armed, yes several armed guards walking around inside, not sure how to feel about that. I have never really gone during the day but they have a lot of facilities for kids if you have them. Overall a really cool place worth the price."
4,"Food was great and the atmosphere was lovely. The drinks were a little pricy, even tho it was happy hour. service was a little slow tooo."
4,"I've been the Drai's twice now. The first night they closed guest list early, before 11:30pm. So our group of 3 ladies had to pay $20 each. Disappointing. The second time we were on guest again. Ladies were free and guys were $40 Saturday night Labor Day Weekend, which is a good deal. Guest list line moves fast.\n\nThe venue itself is spacious and elegant. It's like Marquee and XS in the sense that there's dance floor inside and a pool outside. Bars are located on opposite side of the dance floor. \n\nThe highlight of Drai's are the lights. The LED screens, the LED disco ball, the lasers. Whoo fun stuff. Great DJs. \n\nBTW Drais is located at the Cromwell hotel, with free valet parking. Just tip the valet please!"
4,"Cheapest place to buy liquor.\nFor all the Californians, think of...Bev Mo!! \n$24 for a 750ml bottle of Hennessy. \n\nYou can't go wrong with that!!!"
4,"I'm really happy to finally have Downtown Summerlin open. There are a good list of shops, restaurants and stores available. I love how it is similar to Town Square and can be seen right off of the 215 freeway. It was fun to watch it grow as I live just down the street. I hope to see all the bad stores like Shaggy Chic or Off Broadway Shoe Warehouse (don't waste your money those places they have terrible customer service) and more places like Earl of Sandwich and GAP come that way I don't have to drive all the way to Fashion Show Mall for a good shopping trip. Also the luxury regal isn't bad since it's more adult friendly than kid friendly :)"
4,"Happy Hour is the best. The chips, salsa and bean dip are phenomenal.\n\nI come here often for happy hour and always have their Mexican Pizza. Pretty tasty. Their Margaritas are also delish. Letty is usually bartending, she's great. Very friendly and attentive."
4,We got a great deal to stay in the MGM from Hotwire. It was 50 dollars a night with an amazing view of the strip. I could not believe how cheap the hotel was. The interior of the hotel was really beautiful. It was nice and clean it had a huge wall size window. The view of the strip was best seen at night. \n\nI did get annoyed of the green light. But it wasn't a big deal. i think I got use to it after the second night we stayed... They offered us 20 bucks off on the MGM buffet which was totally worth it because the food was pretty good. It was not the best buffet in Vegas but it was very good. The mimosas in the morning was a perfect hangover remedy. haha\n\nI would definitely book MGM through Hotwire again. This place was exactly what I expected from a Vegas Hotel. Clean and Affordable and Great Location!

4,We stopped in at the Keg for dinner and had a splendid time.\n\nService was prompt and efficient.\n\nThe food was splendidly done.   \n\nWe had the goat cheese appetizer and were very pleased with the baked cheese flavors.\n\n The salad's greens were crisp and not overly covered in dressing.\n\nThe vegetables were crisp and not overcooked.   \n\nI ordered a rare filet.  It was a wonderfully done rare when it arrived.  The only thing that could have made it better was more blood.  \n\nMy spouse ordered the filet and crab. Each was done perfectly.\n\nThe big surprise was the coffee was as good the creme brulee (not so last time).\n\nI highly recommend the Keg as an alternative to more pricey alternatives (Ruth's Chris and Morton's).
4,"A first rate golf complex on the beautiful campus of ASU. The clubhouse is well stocked with ASU gear & serves tasty, reasonably priced lunches."
4,"Located in Ocean Terminal this is a rather large branch of Clinton Cards with a fabulous range of cards, wrapping paper, stationary and gifts. I spent a lot longer than I should have done in here and picked up a few bargains along the way.\n\nAs an animal lover, I was delighted that they had a range of little compact mirrors, pencils, pens and key rings with animals on them. Everything in the very cute range was reduced to 99p so I snapped up a few of the little compacts.\n\nI was hysterical when I noticed the most bizarre gift ever in the wedding section. It was a box saying \""Congratulations on your Wedding Day\"" and inside was the cheapest looking bobble head black cat wearing a diamante collar and earrings. What? I don't know much about weddings and am not sure if this is some kind of tradition but I've certainly never heard of it before and it really was the most bizarre thing I've ever seen. I would love to see the look on the happy couples face when they open that up. Don't count on getting an invite to the Golden Anniversary party if you turn up to the wedding with such a gift. I urge everyone to go in to see it - it's hilarious!\n\nAside their odd choice of wedding gifts, this branch of Clinton Cards is well stocked, very well organised and the staff are friendly too."
4,"In the daytime, great laid back vibe and good coffee.\n\nIn the evening, great laid back vibe, good coffee, and live local bands or open-mic nights.\n\nIf only it weren't in a strip mall."
4,"Groupon led me in and I was real anxious to try it. I'd driven by it for years on the way to Charlotte and the curiosity led me to buy a Groupon for half off. I was very pleased. The food had a lot of flavor. I had the egg plant dish and it was the best I'd had. There spaghetti sauce was liken to an old family recipe. Their cheese bread complimented the meal beautifully. The atmosphere made it much better, it was a homey place with artsy designs and the staff were very welcoming and helpful. I'd love to go back soon, I'd say the food was very authentic just like the owners."
4,"I have been eating here about once a week for about 2 years. The food is consistently very good, with large portions and good quality ingredients. When I moved from Henderson to Summerlin I was worried that I wouldn't find a Chinese take out anywhere as good as China A Go Go, but this comes pretty close. Some of my favorites include Singapore Noodles, War Wonton Soup, and Chicken w/broccoli. The only improvement I'd really like to see is them taking American Express (they only take Visa & MC), but I understand why they don't."
4,"Was in Vegas and needed a pedicure and manicure badly. Showed up without an appointment and waited about 10 mins on a Thursday. During lunch time. I got Jimmy to do my pedicure and I chose got stone pedicure which costs 45 but if you add  gel it's with gel it's and upgraded that costs 25 more. I chose and ombr\u00e9 nail look so add on another 5, Not bad if you ask me but I live in Hawaii so it's significantly more there anyway. Tuyet did my mani and it was  gel as well with ombr\u00e9 and accent nail goal for that is 40. Yes it was pricey but it was totally worth for the look that I wanted. If I ever come back I will come back here again."
4,"Pros: 24/7, service great, We were hungry so just about anything would have been good. I had the asian lettuce cups. Made to perfection. Hubby hada mushroom swiss angus burger with fries. He ate the whole thing! \n\nCons: A bit pricey."
4,"The sushi quality is great. The service is top notch. The atmosphere and decor are great -- the kind of place you can easily bring a date and have a romantic night. Things here are on the pricier side though. Ultimately, it's another sushi place. Your sushi ain't made of gold leaf. I'd give 5 stars if the food was a bit cheaper."
4,"It's a beat up Chinese restaurant with good food and ridiculously low prices. A regular lunch spot for me, since it's near my office.  Service is very quick as they make every effort to get you out to make room for the next customer. Not the kind of place where you can lounge around as you will receive a look from the staff that clearly says it's  time to go. But the good food and great prices make the former easy to get past."
4,"How has Great Harvest escaped notice? It's a franchise, but....\n\nThis place feels like a casual, local spot, with a friendly counter staff. They ply you with bakery samples when you walk in the door. Try one of the unusual breads, like Guinness-cheese, or jalapeno-cheese. Slather your chunk with an appropriate amount of soft butter or preserves.\n\nIn addition to delicious breads, rolls, cookies, and other sweets, they make great sandwiches for lunch. They offer usual suspects, like turkey, ham, and roast beef. The chicken salad was a bit iffy, but the club is tasty. Great Harvest goes a bit heavy on the red onion on most, so take some breath mints for afters.\n\nA box lunch comes with chips, a large drink, and a dessert from the pastry case. Try a Savannah Bar. They are delicious oaty crumble bars, rich with butter, sugar and fruit like blueberries, apples, cranberries, or peaches. Because they dish up your sweet right after you order, you generally get to finish your dessert before your lunch arrives.\n\nMy only complaint is that the place can feel a bit disorganized at times. But they usually aren't terribly busy, so even during the lunch rush you can generally grab a table and a quick lunch."
4,"we've been here one other time about 3 plus years ago and decided to come again for lunch.  we were the first and only ones in at 11 am.  i really wish more restaurants would open earlier than 11 am because i like to eat early lunches.  chips and salsa were good.  its a roasted darker salsa which i enjoy.  i like this place because i like americanized mexican food in big portions and not pretentious or fancy and ridiculously expensive.  my enchiladas were filling and tasty, and my wifes tacos were good.  so to me it really hits the spot.  its reasonably priced, good service, and its in new york which is always enjoyable to go visit."
4,"This place is excellent! I have been here probably 8 times in the last three months and bad thing that has happened so far was that they only had white rice that day(one time, probably the third of fourth visit). \n\nAs for the food, you can safely say that it's not the best but it is FAR from the worst. Everything I've eaten (currys, pad thai, phrik khing, hot and sour soup, sweet and sour pork, and more) was, to say the least, edible. The curry is spiced perfectly from my experience. The phrik khing's vegetables were fresh and crisp. Possibly the only dish I didn't really enjoy was the sweet and sour pork but I have come to expect sub par Chinese food from Thai, Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese establishments. On the other end of the spectrum, the hot and sour soup is orgasmic. One of the most flavorful things I have ever had the privilege to put in my mouth. \n\nThat being said, I give the food a 7/10. Although, if you factor in the competitive price, I might raise that to an 8.5/10. \n\nThe last thing I wanna go over is the service. Every time I've been here it has been the same waitress who has always been polite and friendly while clearly doing her best to take care of my party. \n\nTL:DR fairly decent food at a pretty decent price. Also has super cute waitress."
4,We didn't have a reservation and they were more than happy to take us in. Hosts were nice and refilled my water without having me to ask even once.\n\nI did not notice any girl hostesses or servers that night? Maybe they were off or something.\n\nFood: Servers were very friendly in recommending something to eat from the menu. We had portabella mushroom as an appetizer and I had fish to eat for dinner. it was really good.\n\nPrices were on the upside. This place is great for date night and small social gatherings. I would come back here.
4,"Made it back in for sushi over the weekend and it was good! The only thing I didn't like was the \""crab mix\"". It comes in a lot of the rolls and I just wasn't partial to it. I did really like the spicy tuna and the spicy crunch rolls. The summer Vegas was good too, but minus the crab on top. \nWe missed happy hour pricing, but it was still a gret value at regular price! We left full and happy!"
4,"Great burgers and dogs, grilled thin crust pizza, sandwiches and more. You can't beat some of the unique twists that Joe's puts on common fare. Especially when they are using their own farm fresh produce. Casual and comfortable atmosphere as well. \n\nFull review and more pictures: http://blog.phosyzzle.com/2011/03/02/joes-farm-grill/"
4,"Stopped by  here for a late night dinner. The portions are HUGE and I do mean huge, one plate could probably feed me for 2 days. I ordered the skewer, beef was a little dry but not bad. The Mai Thai I ordered was also in a big glass but tasty and they also serve breakfast all day long which was a plus."
4,"Good Chicken shawrma, got the lunch portion which was very reasonably priced (7.50 I think).  Although the waitress gave me rice instead of the veggie option, the meal was still well worth it.  Good for the $$, will be back for lunch again."
4,"First off there are two different Lino's location, we have only always gone to the one on Tenaya. We have been ordering from here for about 7 years. We are picky about our pizza as my husband is from NY and we have to have good dough. If you like spicy their Giardiniera sauce, (Italian condiment) is a favorite of mine. We order from here a couple of times a month."
4,"Grand just keeps getting better and better. Won't be long before it starts to get swarmed like Roosevelt, pushing all the artists and kewl shit further west. But in the meantime, places like The GAP exist (not sure it's legal to call it that?). Pizza places can be all the same, but these guys get creative. Brussel sprouts is their best, but I had some weird chicken thing (I think the chef was stoned, in a good way) and it was amazing when I had the drunchies (drunk munchies). Really looking forward to the music stuff they'll be doing in the future.\n\nThings I would like to see:\nDraft beers + growlers. Federal Pizza has a pretty damn good program going on they should implement."
4,"Yummy Boba tea, great slush drinks, and cute servers. What's not to love? \n\nWell, it can get a little expensive for a college student, but prices are comparable to Starbucks ;) Go get some Boba!"
4,"Thus far, I've only been once - but I have to admit that the staff here is way friendlier than any other UPS Store or Fedex/Kinko's that I have ever been to.  I have no idea what causes it, but whatever the reason, they sure do seem to enjoy their job, and that means I'll be back to do my shipping from this location rather than any other.\n\nEven better is that it's the closest to our house.  Sweet."
4,"To take a step away from the more authentic Mexican places we've been eating lately, we decided to try out Salsa's, which is more towards the Americanized style of Mexican food.  That doesn't make it bad - just different, so if you're wanting authentic, you may want to go elsewhere.\n\nInside of this Salsa's, the decor is very nice.  The only complaint is the lighting.  Along the right side of the restaurant, the ceiling fans and the low lights combine to create a very annoying strobe affect.  It was so bad we had to move.  Once we did, it wasn't a problem at all.\n\nService was excellent, speedy and efficient all around.  Glasses were kept filled, and food came out quickly.  One thing I'll typically do at a new restaurant (new for me, not necessarily brand new) is ask for advice, and the waiter offered it.  A nice touch.  I hate it when they can't do so.\n\nThe food was tasty - ingredients were fresh, sauces were not overwhelming.  I had a (steak) chimichanga, and it was one of the better ones that I can recall tasting.  For this sort of Mexican, I'd highly suggest you try them out."
4,"I had Biblos with a large group of classmates (Around 30 of us) at the end of a very intense week of study. Glad to report that Biblos was a great choice to end such a wonderful week.\n\nBiblo is a pretty large restaurant, it has 1 and a half floors, we took the \""half floor\"" upstairs as the place was already packed downstairs.\n\nWith music in the background and its dimly lit ambiance, it has a fine-dining feel to it but its prices, while high, isn't outrageous. (Psst, I also heard that they have student discounts if you have your student ID with you)\n\nA huge selection of food, all of which, sounds interesting. All of us had a hard time deciding. The poor staff had to keep coming back to us as we indecisively looked through the menu over and over again.\n\nThe staff were very friendly. When our professors needed to make some final announcements, the staff were kind enough to temporarily turn down the music until we were done.\n\nThe portions of food is rather large and it tasted great! \n\nI'd say it is a good place for groups!"
4,"We have been twice in the last couple of months, different kids, different issues. The staff was friendly and responded to our issues accordingly. When I brought in a child with low O2 levels, all the examination rooms were full. But, the dr saw us immediately after finding out. Diagnosis was spot on. \n\nWe also have had xrays done to make sure a toddler sized pinky wasn't broken. The waiting room is a bit drab, the crowd is mixed, and you'll see people in their pajamas. But, it is worth the 25min drive, passing urgent cares in the way, to see a pediatrician."
4,I've reviewed the Kohl's store located down in South Phoenix/Ahwatukee and seeing that Kohl's is a chain there isn't much difference between each store that I've found. \n\nBut once again I have to admit that Kohl's usually has some pretty good sales going. And if you add in the discounts they send you in the mail (or email) if you are a credit card holder you can really get some great deals.\n\nI'm always amazed how much stuff you can walk out with for the money you spend. Check out the clearance racks and sale signs throughout the store. \n\nThe store was clean and well-stocked and checkout was a breeze. \n\nI tend to be a thrifty shopper and am usually pretty happy with the Kohl's shopping experience. Hopefully you'll be happy too.
4,"I tried the Ahi salad which was just very good, the avocado was just over whelming though, it was just too much, but other than that it was really good. The burger was very juicy, delicious, and cooked to perfection.\nOur dessert was Snickers sunday, which has amazing crunchy yet chewy melting caramel snickers, lovely peanut butter sauce, chocolate sauce, and tons of whipped cream. It was just an amazing sunday. so big, between two of us it was impossible to finish. I am definitely coming back soon to try out more desserts. Everything was just so amazing, the menu looked awesome, so hard to choose one single thing.\nQuick service, there is a bit of a wait, which is fine, since it is totally worth it."
4,"As a self described lazy person, I decided to change things up from my typical Las Vegas debauchery and food come eating habbits to do something active in the desert for once. We found Sky Zone after reading some reviews so my buddy and I (who are huge coupon whores) added Sky Zone as a friend on facebook and scored on their $3 off admission and headed over to check it out.\n\nCool moon shoes + an injury waiver= AWESOME TIMES \n\nThe whole place is a giant trampoline broken into squares so you and your friends can have your own little area. There is dodge ball on the far side but you dont have to get involved if you dont want to. Just jump around, race your friends, or try and bust out some flips. Its SO exhausting. We lasted for maybe 5 minutes before we had to sit down and an hour is a LONG TIME. We would probly do the half hour next time just because we're so out of shape. \n\nSeriously awesome stuff, as a big kid, I have to say its pretty fun to just let it all bounce out and fly around. Everyone is like a kid in here!"
4,"I came here the other day with my mom at about 2:50. The waiter was nice enough to give us both the lunch special prices and happy hour! What a nice guy! Anyway, I have been coming here for many years and it is always good. The lunch specials are a great deal and they come with a salad with yummy gingery dressing and these wonton chips which are addictive! For the meal, I especially like their crispy noodles and their potstickers. The potstickers are really crunchy and come with both a hot chili oil and a regular potsticker sauce. They're really good, and the price can't be beat at happy hour ($2.50). They also have good lettuce wraps, kind of citrus flavored and spicy, and teppanyaki beef (a rich sweet sauce over thicker spaghetti like noodles). Although it is Americanized chinese, it is still a place I will continue to return to."
4,"Don't go on 1st Friday unless you want it to be super crowded!  Hipster vibe with good food and drinks on tap.  Slightly uptight staff.  No hard booze though.  Seating encourages canoodling couples or mixing with strangers.  Try the grilled cheese and tomato soup.  I know, it's expensive, but so yummy!  They have a pasta special, but I can' remember if it is on Wed or Thurs.  Come early, as they sell out."
4,My go to place for boba drinks. Honey green milk tea or Thai tea are my favorites. Don't forget to ask for a punch card.
4,"Went there with the parents and had a great time. It was crowded, but didn't feel too busy to where it was distracting, it had a good vibe. \n\nOur service was outstanding and is definitely why I would go back. We had a great waiter who made the experience enjoyable. After reading reviews, I knew we had to try the pulled pork sandwich which was just as delicious as everyone said. The big surprise of the night was the shrimp appetizer which was awesome. It was creamy, flavorful, and a great way to start a meal. Definitely would get it again. \n\nI was disappointed with the dessert menu. Nothing seemed to grab my attention and I was full enough from everything else. \n\nAll in all we had a great time, great food, and great service and all agreed we would definitely return."
4,"I love Ginza and the idea of a sushi bar in a pseudo dinning car. I mean it makes sense. Japan grew to it's world status by copying American processes and refining, how more Americana can you get than a chrome dining car that failed as a retro 50s diner?\nSushi, as I have been lead to believe, is a communal / social endeavor. At Ginza, it is hard to do with the loud Japanese pop music. I prefer my sushi with more soothing music or at least with music at a volume that you can carry on a conversation. Maybe I am the exception and not the norm.\nI love the food and the service is good and friendly and, as previously mentioned, there is no better place to celebrate a birthday. I recommend you to find out yourself. It is awesome!"
4,"I've only used Sunset Park for the dog park.\n\nSunset park has two dogs parks located on the south side of the park (warm springs side). One park is for the bigger dogs while the other is for smaller dogs.\n\nBoth enclosed dog areas are very big and have plenty of room for dogs to run around. Their are hoses at the park so that people are able to wash their dogs or fill up water bowls. The parks as well offer poopie bags incase you forget you own.\n\nThey is a shaded area with tables for owners to sit and relax while dogs have fun playing.\n\nMy only issue with this place is those that frequent it often and feel entitled as royalty. I bring my dog here when I'm in the area and she isn't very social. She likes me to walk with her and if I sit down, she lays next to me. Dogs at times don't understand personal space and wouldn't let her be. The owners don't help if others dogs were pestering her or playing too rough. I believe one of the regulars said something to the point as, \""if you don't want rough dog play, don't bring your dog here.\""\n\nOutside that, it's great. It's just those days when you have the \""Michael Vick Battle Dog Owners\"""
4,"Nino's is a one of those places you hear about, want to go & give it a try and drive past it over and over again until the stars line up right and the soccer team you are playing on is sponsored by Chrissy's Nino's Pizzeria!! How crazy is that?!\nIt's a fun place to go for some beers, small pitchers are available :-), wings and pizza. The pizza is tasty and will fill you up, no mater how you want them to cut it for you! The wings are spot on with flavor and meat...some of the biggest wings I've seen in a restaurant ever!! They've got a pretty decent menu and does cater to those who are watching their figure more than the average soccer player with hearty salads!! They do have desert for the kids and enjoy having kids in the shop. I think the kids get a bigger kick out of going after Saturday night soccer than anyone!\nGo sit for a spell, have a few beers, grab some hot wings and a couple slices of pie! Great place to chill and watch life go by for a bit on Olive & 99th Avenue!!"
4,"After multiple flat out miserable experiences at the Center City Hilton, I tried out the Omni and have been going back ever since. If you are looking for something more budget minded, Aloft right across the street will do well. If you are looking for something a little more high end but not quite Ritz level, Omni hits it on the head. I have stayed here 8 times thus far and on every occasion I have had excellent service via the front desk, immaculately clean rooms, and good room service. I always stay in the same executive corner suite over looking the epicenter so I can't speak toward the standard junior suite quality. I prefer the larger rooms. I have recommended this to my family coming to town for my upcoming wedding. Love this place. Easy walking distance to everything from Chima, Ruths Chris, Pita Pit, and smack across the street from the epicenter and all its restraunts, bars, movie theater, bowling alley, and the like."
4,"Such variety!  I had the pennyworth with mung bean and grass jelly while Mr. W had a three-color dessert.  Both were quite delicious~  While I really wanted to try their snow, I was way too full from dinner to even think about passing such deliciousness through these lips.  A table nearby was devouring a huge plate though and it looked amazing.\n\nService was super friendly and I like how they had more to offer than the usual boba tea places.  I will definitely be back!"
4,"This place was pretty good!  I had baby back ribs & fries, and both were very flavorful. The ribs were extremely tender, and the fries had an excellent seasoning on them. The service was decent - it was a pretty quiet time of day when we were there - but attentive."
4,"Really a 41/2.  Back a week later except ate in the bar this time.  Had them make a scallop role in soy paper with caviar on top, awesome.  Also, stuck with sashimi again - yellowtail, snow crab, Japanese halibut, albacore, and octopus.  One tuna nigiri and miso soup too.  Had a couple martini's and had a shot of this unbelievable tequila called Deleon.  Very smooth and unique.  Expensive but we were celebrating so very worth it.  Service was very good and our server was very helpful and offered other local joints to eat at suggestion wise.  Expensive but a great place."
4,"My family and I always enjoy eating here.  The food is always fresh and the staff is very friendly.  However,  every time we have ordered take out they always get the order wrong."
4,"Fourth star just for ambiance and nice staff. Pretty bar located in the new \""it\"" hotel in Vegas. I had one of the special cocktails (Hot Mule) and I must admit, it was quite tasty. Not even a hit of a buzz, so I'm not sure what the alcohol content was, but it tasted good and sipping it gave me a chance to relax for a few minutes. I happened to be there on a weekday, so there were MAYBE 4 other people in the bar. I imagine this place probably gets pretty packed on the weekends with insufferable hipsters and cougars, but mid-week, mid-day, it was a nice piece of quiet and pretty. Staff were super nice."
4,"Their rolls are REALLY good. Their happy hour special is EVERYDAY. 5pm to closing.. which is REALLY good. 50% off sushi rolls, and 30% off nigiri. Everytime I go there, we get the same waitress.. and she's great! Very attentive, fast, and friendly. Food comes to you really fast, and I love how the place looks inside. Really cozy.. I come here like once a week..Definitely a good place to go."
4,"We went here for dinner this weekend and the wait was about an hour and fifteen minutes, we were able to put our name in and they would just send us a text letting us know our table was ready which is pretty great. That meant we could leave and go to another place for a drink if we had wanted to. Luckily there was room at the bar for us so we ordered a drink and the pesto fries appetizer while we waited. The fries were delicious and the pesto was amazing. So good I decided to order the pesto pasta as my entree and I am so glad I did. The pasta sauce was also very creamy which I loved. My husband ordered the fish and chips and tried a few bites of it as well, it was great with wonderful flaky crust. Their tartar sauce was amazing. My best friend ordered their burger which I didn't try because I don't eat beef but she said it was delicious. I will be going here again in the future."
4,"I'm not complaining about the price because I knew in advance that it was $40 per person (price as of this past Saturday night).\n\nSo much food to choose from!!! \n\nThe meat is delicious: prime rib, beef wellington, LAMB CHOPS, pork belly, and on...\n\nCrab legs, prawns, sushi, caviar, cerviche, I couldn't get through all the seafood options.\n\nSalads, asparagus, cheeses, cured meats, soups, olive breads, there was no way I could get to it all.\n\nSo many desserts: amazing cheesecake, macrons, lemon meringue, chocolate desserts, ice creams, bread pudding, fruit, etc.\n\nSo much food and all of it good. Some of the servers were great and friendly (especially the guy chopping up the medium rare beef and pork belly) though one woman seating us rolled her eyes when my friend asked if we could wipe down the table because it had food on it. Another guy, serving the beef wellington, was really grouchy and was yelling at one of his co workers rather than letting anyone have any of his dish. I had to yell \""excuse me\"" about 5 times to get his attention. The guy dishing out the caviar was also rude because I didn't know the names of the different kinds. \""Can I please try the black caviar?\"" I asked. His terse answer: \""UH, It's called American caviar!\"" I've never had caviar before and had no idea, ha ha!\n\nOverall, a good time and good food. I was stuffed and can't eat like this all the time, so it was a treat!"
4,Had the mega meat pizza... It was pretty good. Usually take my kids here as it has a play area.
4,"Let's not kid ourselves, this isn't vegan health food. This is get your mock meat sandwich on and be happy food. I've tried a few of the veggie entrees and they're just not what ZiZi's does well. Go elsewhere to get a plate full of wonderfully cooked veggies. Go here when you want something a little fried, a little sinful. I've tried several different things on the menu now but the real winners are the chicken tenders, the buffalo chicken sandwich and the spicy wings. I could eat the wings daily, seriously. \n\nPlease call your order in ahead of time. You don't want to sit in their hot waiting area on a summer day (feel for the employees) and speedy isn't the name of the game here. The delivery service is outsourced and while handy, makes the process take even longer. \n\nI do hope they look into a better, easier to get to location."
4,"My husband and I love to entertain and also enjoy a bottle of wine or a couple beers together.  Total Wine offers domestic and International liquor.  Everything from beer, wine, vodka, soju, sangria, etc.  Prices range from fair/modest to expensive (depending what you are buying).\n\nThey also have a walk-in Humidor area with a nice selection of cigars (yep, I smoke a nice cigar with my hubby on occasion!)\n\nOn certain days they have a counter set up where you can sample wine, one day we were lucky enough to sample some wonderful tequila.  The representatives were knowledgeable and helpful.  No high pressure sales; \""if you like, you buy\""  if not, it is ok too!\n\nThere is an amazing variety, fair prices (you can get 10% discount for buying a case of wine), the staff is friendly and super helpful!\n\nIt is a great one-stop shop!  It is clean, uber-organized and if you don't find what you are looking for---the very knowledgeable staff is quick and very informative.\n\nTotal Wine is our TOP SPOT for stocking up on all our alcohol!  A MUST for entertaining and party planning!\n\nSuper pleased!"
4,"Great location in Old Town Scottsdale. Room was only $89 on Memorial Day weekend for a suite. They don't have room service, but they have a food menu: you call in your order. When it's ready, the call your room, and you go down and pick it up. The food was good!"
4,"Very large portions, extremely reasonable prices. All is clean and fresh. Staff is kind of robotic but efficient. Interact accepted. Be warned: they close damn early at 9pm. Sharp!"
4,"I love this place because it combines so many things I dig: sandwiches, Italianism, a great wine selection, and an overall nice casual atmosphere. If I had a market, I'm pretty sure it would be like this one if I could help it.\n\nThe one critical thing I would add is that next time I'm craving DeFalco's on a Saturday at around noon, I think I'll call in the order. It's a rather popular place for lunch."
4,"I started out on a quest to find Madison's best fish fry and stumbled upon this place. One thing to know beforehand is they do not take reservations and they pack the place on Friday nights. Expect to wait a while. This is a nice little neighborhood bar on the east side of Madison that has a huge following. They offer several different types of fish for the Friday fish fry. Fried or Baked Cod, Perch, or Walleye. I went with the fried cod which was absolutely delicious. I couldn't turn down the garlic chili fries or their home made chili. Needless to say I could have used a wheel chair for the way out! It was by far one of the better fish fry joints to go to in town and I will for sure be back. My only complaint with the place was that they don't take reservations and they won't do carry out during lent (due to an overwhelming amount of business) but it's good to see a business that does so much business they have to turn some away."
4,"Wanted to check out what Arizona's scene was about. I wanted to see a live show, i wanted to hear good music-& that's what i got.\n\nThe music was more than i expected it to be so BIG UPS to the DJ for the underground!! This place also had people on the canvas, tables all around & a small dance floor-which actually reminded me of places back home. \n\nIt was a pleasure seeing Simple Citizens from LA rocking the stage...full band w/ MC who also has a trumpet player. Crackin.\n\nIn addition was their drink SPECIAL. Yes, there was a $10 cover charge for the show-but the bar charged a QUARTER(!) per drink before 11p then $5 drinks thereafter. WOW. Good to know, especially for the next time i come to visit, I'll be sure to hit this place up nice & early. Yet another spot aside from the Lost Leaf that i will be frequenting when I visit The Grand Canyon State again."
4,Great service and friendly staff.  \nI had the tuna salad and the tuna was albacora fresh and the greens were the good kind and not just iceburg. \nI would recomend this place.
4,"I've been here quite a few times, and let me give you the tl;dr about the place.\n\nThe traditional hotdog, with a bunch of different stuff on top of it. I'm a hotdog lover and I've tried every single regular dog on the menu -- and I like it most of the time. Except that it's just that odd time when something comes out a bit strange or not quite right that makes me dock one star."
4,"The food has a wonderful  blending of flavors.  Craig was our server and he was very attentive.  My husband has allergies and the kitchen was very careful on the ingredients in each dish.  It is  more than we normally pay for burgers - but these are gourmet, a real treat.  We would definitely come back."
4,When to this place today it's a regular pizza place. The only thing is that there was only a pepperoni pizza made maybe we were there a bit early but that seemed weird... Inside the boulder station so great place to go after a movie or before! Nice price and a pretty big slice I'm a pizza lover so I recommend
4,"The name of this place deserves 5 stars. Mayyybeeeee I'm a little immature, but it never stops making me giggle.\n\nGreat 24 hour pho spot in Vegas. You can always find either drunk or hungover vegas-goers here. Service is shitty and rude, but they are fast and efficient on bringing your food and bill out. They want you IN and OUT. no joke."
4,"The Arts Factory is a cool place to hang out and procure some amazing art and other oddities. There is of course your normal awesome paintings and canvas works of art, but there is also an eclectic mix of other forms of \""art\"" and fun things. Hiptazmic studio which is full of awesome upcycled/recycled jewelry and decor items, along with original art pieces, tshirts, engraved tags, patches and more. Happy Panda toys with it's awesome vinyl toy collection, they also throw release parties where you can come in and trade with other fanatics. Then there is Hell Pop, they have a great comic and alternative book selection!\n\nThe Arts Factory has a little bit for everyone with the variety of items within its walls. Bar and Bistro the restaurant is also worth a visit, the pizzas are tastyriffic! Best time to come down and check things out is on First Friday, not only is the AF hopping but there is a plethora of booths and other happenings in the immediate area for your perusing pleasure."
4,"Amazing beer selection, and very good desserts, especially the Belgian chocolate pudding. The rest of the food is a bit meh. Monday night trivia is always a good time."
4,Only done take out here.  I have been impressed with the counter service and the food keeps us comeing back.
4,"I'm going to give this 4 stars because there are very few options for Malaysian and Dim Sum in Pittsburgh but if this were in a larger city it would probably be more like 3 stars.\n\nI went there once for lunch and had one of their Malaysian noodle soup dishes which was pretty good but not amazing.  I also went for Dim Sum on a Sunday and very much enjoyed it.  They had a large diversity of options and everything was very tasty.  It's certainly not at the level I've had in places like Boston, Seattle, or NYC but for Pittsburgh I was very satisfied.  My friend who had lived in China for a year also found it to be pretty decent.  I would definitely go there again.  \n\nThe service was very good and the prices reasonable. The atmosphere was comfortable though I found the lighting to be rather dark.  There is also some outdoor seating available when the weather is good and a full bar with seating."
4,"HOLY SHAROLEE!!!  My co-worker and best friend suggested that we run down to Haps for a quick bite and to get out of the office for a bit.  Even though I brought lunch I was down for the escape. \n\nWe get there and right when we get to the register in this little case they have like four different kinds of what looks to be cobblers.  They have a peach one.  A PEACH ONE!!  I was so stoked.  Peach is my favorite.  I ordered the special that they had on the sandwich board outside.  Hot ham and cheese.  A large drink and the peach cobbler.  The cashier immediately asks me if I want ice cream to go with it.  I decided no because it might melt before it would be of any use to my cobbler.  The employee that was going to make our sammiches is behind the counter and I see her go grab a peach cobbler and pop it into the microwave.  WOW its gonna be warm oooey goodness.  Fill my drink the large is \nL A R G E two hands needed.  I get done and our sammiches are ready.  Quick, quick, quick! \n\nWe get back to the office and I dive into the peach.  Oh my goodness.  It was/is so good.  It was yummy.  I thought about sharing with my friend but decided against it.  Too good.  The sandwich was good.  I liked it and the price wasn't bad."
4,"Love that Sambalatte is now open on 215 & Jones, don't have to drive all the way to summerlin~\n\nThis location is a lot smaller than the one out in summerlin but there's more seating available outside vs inside I think. It's great to sit outside on a warm day but not on a hot vegas summer day of 104+degrees...\n\nI went around 6pm on a Wednesday and there were only a few people there so the service was quick! I ordered the iced macha latte. They didn't ask me for a size so I thought it would be a regular or something but when I got my drink it was in a large cup! It was delicious & worth your money.\nI also ordered a nutella latte before and that was great too.\n\nThey have a variety of pastries/desserts that you can purchase as well; including  macaroons! \n\nGreat place to grab a coffee and chill or catch up with friends.\n\nThere's tons of parking outside of the shop too!"
4,"So me and a lady friend stopped here for a night out a month back. \n\nWe arrived, there seemed to be no self parking or maybe I'm just not aware of it. Because it was just valet at the front. So i of course had to valet it. Which to me is odd. I'm not a huge fan of a valet service. I'm a big boy, I'll park my own fucking vehicle, FOR FREE. But whatev's. \n\nI tried to bypass that. We entered and found a both near the bar. The food is a mix/hybrid/fusion of mexican-new mexican food. \n\nI forgot what I had at the time. But I remember it being REALLY REALLY good. We also shared a great bottle of red wine that our server recommended to us. \n\nThe service was awesome, the food was amazing. A bit pricy, but like i've said before. You get what you pay for. \n\nDefinitely a place to check out, a wonderful date environment."
4,"Dim sum done well for pocket change. I always get the chicken feet and char shiu bao. In order to eat some delicious dim sum, you must be willing to make a few sacrifices. \n\nOn busy days, the servers will probably never be there to help you or even bring you water. You must be proactive and actually walk up to these guys. Expect a few scowls from the ladies pushing their carts. No one can be continuously cheerful pushing one of these things all morning. And when they do smile, you know it's gonna be a good day:) \n\nOh, and don't wait for your check at the table. Bring your little stamp card up front so they can ring you up. Otherwise, you could be there forever. Why give it 4 stars, you ask? Chinese restaurants are notorious for bad service. I'm grading on a curve."
4,Food was well done and well presented.  The grilled octopus was cooked just right. And the main dishes and dessert were quite good.  On the pricy end but was good for taking my wife there for her birthday dinner and a special evening.
4,"Having been a Vegas local for eight years I was used to the amenities of the Suncoast but had not ever stayed there. The rates and knowing that it was a well-maintained property brought me to choose it for a recent overnite stay.  A wise choice on my part. \n\nThe property is known as being a very good locals casino in a very nice part of town -- Summerlin. The rates are low because it is a Coast (Boyd) property. If you don't have a need to be near the Strip, the Suncoast is definitely the Boyd property to pick. \n\nClean room, efficient, friendly check-in and a staff that is focused on the guest. \n\nFor the gamer, the comps are above average. It does not take much play to get a buffet and if you are even a casual player they may be able to hook you up with some promotion for your next stay. \n\nThe table games are typical but I do like the dealers. $5 blackjack is common throughout the day (even double deck). The poker room is more or less an afterthought; which is disappointing when you consider the efforts Boyd puts into a big room in a dump like the Orleans. Boyd sportsbooks are among the best and I look forward to returning during football season.\n\nAll-in-all, this is one of the best values in town."
4,Good food and good entertainment.  Food is good and plentiful.  Where the Key West Margaritaville lacks in flare this place has it.
4,Have to judge on what I ordered...Shrimp Fried Rice... It was pretty d*^m good.   We ordered SFR with the extra shrimp & I was impressed with the amount of shrimp & the size of the order.  & they use real shrimp... not those fake baby shrimp.
4,"Oh Dollar Tree, you have everything I could ever want and not need. You provide me with endless rows of colorful assorted items. Holiday cards, cups and plates, cleaning supplies, and even food line your rows of dolardom. How much better can you get. The only reason I'm giving you a 4 star instead of a 5 is because of that pesky driveway trying to make a left turn. Yikes. I'm glad I'm still here to Yelp about you after that left hander. \n\nIf you're having a party, go here. If you're poor and need some decent food, go here. If you just remembered it's your grandma's uncle's aunt's niece's 4th birthday, go here. This place has something for all those needs. If you're expecting a high fallutin outing, don't go here. The dollar tree isn't for the faint of heart but it is for the adventurous. :) I'm a fan, and since it's the closest one to me I'll be returning often."
4,About 5-7 minutes from the Strip.  It's a good way to spend 1-2 hours for the kids.\n\nThe Museum is more about the history about the test sites and the neighboring areas than about the science behind the atomic era.  The exhibition area is not large at all but we all learned a great deal.   This is the type of museum that you will visit once and probably will not go back again (because the material is limited).
4,"Inside the Planet Hollywood mall area, this location is ok. Not as friendly service as im used to but they do make a good coffee. Less hassle then the starbucks in planet hollywood casino."
4,"I am a local so I have not stayed here. But, we do come here for many of the things to do here. It is always clean and what staff we do run into have been very nice. We have eaten at most of the restaurant  and have been happy. Really like the new addition Zenshin!! \nThey have a bingo hall, bowling alley and movie theater. We have been to some of the Comedy acts and other convention attractions they have. \nLots to do and not a lot of hussel from all the people on the strip."
4,"This is my new favorite buffet on the Strip! We came on a Friday afternoon, and somehow miraculously avoided waiting. Literally paid and walked right in. It was $32/ person. I loved that there were various cuisines and it was grouped accordingly. My favorites were the tacos. I thought it was comparable to taco places and there was even a full salsa bar to match. I also surprisingly loved the hot and sour soup and found it just as good as ones in Chinese restaurants, ha! Towards the end of our meal (or the beginning of dinner service), crab legs arrived. Yum. Some negatives would be the overdressed (thus salty) Caesar salad and the overcooked (thus dry) prime rib. The desserts looked really good too but I was so full I just had a scoop of blood orange sorbet. Restroom is in very close walking distance (right by the entrance) and service was average. I will be back!"
4,"I tried this place about a month ago, and have been back at least 4 times since. So glad to finally find a Chinese food place near my house that I love. When I call in an order for pick-up, the food is ready within 10 minutes and reasonably priced. \n\nI've never eaten inside the restaurant myself, but it seems nice. There are always a couple waitresses busy keeping the customers happy. It's a small interior, with about 10 booths and 6 tables (which could be pushed together to accommodate a larger group). \n\nGreat wall is in the small strip-mall just South of Walgreens (which is at Williams Field Rd). Also in the strip-mall is Sherwin Williams and Little Caesers"
4,First time I had I fell in love !! Great good and great prices !! You really can't beat it!
4,"We purposely drove along the Penna. turnpike with growling stomachs for hours, just because we were jonesing for Indian.  It was quite a gamble, as we usually can't withstand our hunger pains and give in to a sandwich at Sheets.  \n\nWe staggered into Coriander in a low blood sugar-induced coma-like state, and the friendly host promptly seated us in a booth.  A minute later, some crispy chips arrived with the ubiquitous triangular serving dish containing chutney, the green stuff, and the brown stuff.  I have no idea what these substances are, but we love them!\n\nThe momentary raise in our sugar levels allowed us to review the menu and place our orders: lamb vindaloo (10 on the hotness scale) and palak paneer (7 on the hotness scale.)  We were tempted to get south Indian dosas, as they are so hard to come by as most restaurants focus on northern Indian fare, but we didn't want to gamble. \n\nThe food came promptly, and it was delicious!  The vindaloo didn't disappoint with the spicy heat, but I should have been more conservative in anticipating my ability to absorb fire.  That was my fault, not theirs.  I even said when ordering, \""Make it a 10.  I've been to India before, so I know what that means.\""  Idiocy.  My wife's palak paneer was creamy and dreamy.  \n\nWe walked out of the restaurant with full bellies and korma-eating grins on our faces.  We'll be back next time we're in Pittsburgh, Coriander India Grill!"
4,"Vraiment une belle s\u00e9lection de bi\u00e8res. Le menu bouffe est assez cool aussi, on a pas mang\u00e9, mais \u00e7a semblait assez prometteur (et local!) On a bu de la sangria sur la terasse, c'\u00e9tait sympathique. Ma seule critique est qu'on y est all\u00e9 en apr\u00e8s-midi et qu'il manquait un peu d'ambiance... Une petite musique de fond aurait fait l'affaire :)"
4,"While the crab legs are not top notch.. for 16.50 for locals for unlimited crab, very good prime rib, sushi, clam chowder, great stir-fry, Chinese, and very premium gelato there is nothing to complain about i recommend this buffet to anyone looking to get a great bang for your buck here in the las vegas area, i've been to many buffets but this one i keep coming back to for the price is right and so is the food, only bad thing is get there at 5:30pm or sooner or be prepared to wait in a very long long line :/"
4,first time in this place today. I thought it's a little bit pricey but the food is really good and tasty. I will come here again to try their other entree.
4,"We sat at the bar and the bartender was really attentive! We ordered the Lollipop Passion Goblet! The drink was amazing and so cool! For $36, it was worth the experience. The ice is dry ice, so once the bartender poured the drink over the dry ice, it created the fog effect. The drink tastes like a Midori Sour; it also comes with lollipops and a candy necklace. \n\nWe also ordered some fries and fried mac n cheese! The fries were mediocre but the fried mac n cheese was really good!\n\nI'll be back to try more goblets and entrees!"
4,Went here with my girlfriends for a late breakfast after a night of partying.\nThe french dip with truffle tator tots hit the spot and helped cure my semi-hangover.\nService was good and my coffee cup was constantly refilled!
4,"Was waiting for a bus after getting off the train and with time to spare went into Princess Mall.  (Why do Brits have to give everything royal names?!)  \n\nI hadn't been to a Spud U Like in many years so when I saw the one in the food court there, I had to re-live the old days of hanging out in Exeter and having a spud with tons of a topping on it.\n\nThere were the two of us and I was boring and had the sour cream and chives, while Sylvia had baked beans.  I thought it strange that a Slovak would order baked beans, or even know what baked beans were.  (Do they really bake them?)  I actually got Meal A, which was the topped up tater and a drink.  Well, the drink was a soda but I wanted a coffee, so had to pay 40 pence more.  \n\nBoth spuds were delicious!  The service was fast and the young man working there was also very nice, pleasant, chatty.  It was a fine distraction before the bus to the airport."
4,"The food was amazing. This place use to be a Moe's so the place isn't visually appealing. Interior could use an overhual. Food was great of  course, the chef's are awesome,  the servers were lacking knowledge."
4,"It is lovely little theater that offers a great movie experience. Never a crowd, theater is clean and the snacks are what you would expect - popcorn, candy and soda. Stop by Wine Expression before or after and have a great afternoon"
4,"It was my first visit.  All my co workers have been talking  about this place....with that said,  ..........walking up to this establishment is not impressive.  Please do not take a 1st date here.  All I have heard is about the expansion..and thank goodness!! \n\nThis place is dark, the staff look like they are all on tour of some skating boarding ESPN tour  in town.\n\nBUT!!!!\n\nThe staff  (who look like skateboarders) were great!  Each one of them so friendly, polite and very attentive. \nBeer selection-par none...excellent selection on tab.  \nThe expansion section is inviting for large groups...which was perfect for our work HH.\nMENU- as my friend would say......UNBELIEVABLE!\nI took home a Carne Asada concoction and it was sooooo good.  The calzone idea is great! When you can come up with creative stuffing you can't go wrong.  \n\nAmbiance 3 ..too dark for me \nStaff  5+ -very friendly, attentive & polite\nFood 5+- the calzone spin -UNBELIEVABLE...so good.  even take home.\nBeer 5 -great selection on tab......can't get that everywhere."
4,We had great service. Decor is cool. Food was great. This was my first time after being there once before for lunch. All of the below were great:\n\npre-game bread\nbacon-wrapped pork tenderloin\nlobster (my wife's)\nsweet corn/polenta\nbacon/yukon gold gratin\nforbidden rice\nwine list w/ knowledgeable waiter\nmashed potatoes.\n\ngive it a try...food reminded us of Elements at the Sanctuary....totally undercover and underrated spot near Old Town.
4,"Very awesome restaurant in all respects: good food, good service, good environment, etc. I had French just like three times before. Base on my limited experience, I always thought French comes with very small portion. I ordered the steak and my friend ordered seafood crepe and fish. They are all in huge portion, especially the steak! And they are delicious!!! The hand cut fries and French bread are great! \n\nIf it's not too cold, try to seat outside. It's really romantic and you get to see the strip. \n\nI would give it a 4.5 star."
4,"Great place to just hang out. Friendly service and good food. One of my favorites is the BLT&E. Lots of flavor, not heavy, and just the right amount of \""different\"""
4,"Awesome service and clean rooms. I wouldn't mind staying here again. I didn't like the carnival buffet though. I heard it was world class buffet, maybe on a world I have yet to visit. Congealed macaroni a cheese and old sushi is not my idea of world class. And the whole meal certainly wasn't worth $32.00. Other than the awful food, especially the over-price Chinese restaurant across the way, my stay was great. Will be staying there again and soon."
4,"I love shopping here because they have a large variety of clothes to shop through. AND they're CHEAP! I can get 6-10 pieces of clothing for around $100-120. Downside, they're not the best quality. \n\nFair warning: They do not accept any type of returns on dresses. You also only get exchanges or store credit when you purchase anything. I think as long as you know this, it's fair. I try on everything before I buy it anyways. If you don't like to try things on, then you probably would like to stay away. \n\nOtherwise, this place is great shopping for people who are on a budget. It's great for teenagers up to early 30's I would say. I have found some very trendy outfits and so not so attractive. But to each their own! The place is very organize and they stock clothing pretty often. \n\nThe customer service isn't superior, but the girls are always willing to help, IF you ask them."
4,"The atmosphere of this restaurant may make you question your decision to eat here because it very obviously used to be a Yoshi's/Kyoto Bowl style place, but I'd encourage you to ignore it.  Lose yourself in the little-too-loud dance music and dig in to the interesting menu.\n\nWe got the Salmon Lover, Delish, Eel Cucmber, and Sixty Nine rolls.  All were very enjoyable - they were tasty, had good texture, and were more interesting than the standard sushi restaurant fare.  The Salmon Lover was our favorite - a must try.\n\nSide note:  I'm allergic to avocado, so I usually get nigiri instead of rolls when I try a place for the first time.  The nigiri here was a little on the spendy side and the rolls were so interesting, I asked the waiter if it would be a problem to leave the avocado out.  He was really nice about it and everything came out allergen-free!"
4,"Been here many times, but tonight was different. I was with two others and it was packed. Reservations for 8:45pm. We didn't get sat until almost 10pm. The hostesses were rude or less than apologetic & the waitstaff kept telling us they'd grab us another drink...never did. The bartenders were cordial and the busser; Issac was awesome...he later solved the issue and got us sat...the busser!!! It had been 2 hours, we'd had one drink and we weren't happy at all but we were never rude-just couldn't believe the terrible service we were getting. At this point I'm handing out a 1-star review, however, Issac and our new server Mark were amazing...they knew what our last two hours were like and they took good care of us. They comped a round of drinks...we were going to come back again nonetheless because this experience was a first but they still took care of the round. I think most people would have given this a 1-3 star review but Issac (21 yrs old I might add) and Mark (a seasoned vet) made all the difference. You recovered...you get 4 stars...always room for improvement."
4,Expanded my menu selection to the grilled shrimp appetizer which was as advertised  spicy and then some.  The bread that came with it was the same as served at Uncle Sal's by the same owner's next door minus the calorie laden artery clogging butter garlic sauce (which I kind of missed) but I'll definitely add this to my order next time I go.
4,"Great happy hour! Be sure to arrive before 6pm to take advantage of their awesome \""island time\"" menu (aka happy hour), even available on Saturday. Our foursome enjoyed cocktails: grapefruit basil martini, mojito and margaritas. Everyone was happy. There are great apps on the HH menu too -- the ahi tuna poke is great, and my husband liked the fish tacos. My gluten free friend had a hard time, however. She settled on a salad, but the GF entree options were disappointing. Everyone enjoyed his or her meal. Great ambiance!"
4,I found a great new spot in Vegas right on the strip.  The ambiance transports you to Paris and the food and wine were great as well as the service.
4,"This place is the bombay digity!\n\nLocated on Sahara and Decatur, this small restaurant will give you a cultured taste of India.\n\nThe place is small and very CLEAN! which is a must in my restaurant world..\n\nI was greeted by a very nice helpful waitress who took the time to explain their menu and the pronunciation of each dish.\n\nI ordered the Spinach Paneer. I'm a huge fan of spinach, and this put me into cloud 9.. The dish consisted of spinach and tofu, and some type of sauce.. im really  clueless when it comes to indian food, i just ask what's in it and i eat it!\nhaha!\n\nAlso along with the paneer i had the Garlic Naan, It's good to have with your paneers they compliment each other.\n\nFor dessert I had the Keer, which was some sort of rice pudding with berries on top very delish as well!\n\nSamosa is also vegetarian/vegan friendly which is what drawn me to the place, me being a transitional vegetarian/vegan, i was curious what options i had in an indian restaurant .\n\nOverall i was satisfied with the service and the food, they also have lunch specials during lunch time, i did not even bother to look at that, but will give it a try when I go back!"
4,"I play @ the Bellagio about 6 times a year. Life is formed by the people you interact with in everything. The B poker room is an interesting example. My observation at the B follows. The morning shift, 10A to 6P is great. The shift manager, Calvin is the best. Most employees, dealers, chip; runners, people who clean up and supervisors are terriffic on this shift. The 6P to 2A shift is no where near as good. The kids at the front are too full of themselves. Too slow to start games and generally indifferent to customers like me in the low limit game. Once you sit down you are done with them, but it leaves a bad taste.. There are a few good people on this shift, older Timmy for one. The 2 to 10 staff is also great. \nThe problem, to me, stems from employees at B, like the first review here, give customers instrucions on how to please employees rather than the reverse. Nothing good can come from that attitude."
4,"Bold colors and one-of-a-kind tops that will make you stand out. Reasonable prices, and some funky jewelry. They've also got some classic pieces, like the awesome black Fall jacket that I fell in love with - definitely the kind of piece to add to your wardrobe that you will get lots of use out of, and under $100. \n\nThe girls who work here are friendly, and they've got a decent size sale section in the back. I saw some great summer finds - go get 'em ladies!"
4,"Sam Fox restaurant.  Its the combo of a play-yard (ping pong and cornhole - no not that kind) and drinks, sometimes a band, and good peeps.  Good place to go hang out.  Fun lively atmosphere, etc.  Parking you should plan on valet due to good size crowds (even on sunday).  I cannot comment on the food much as I have only had a few appetizers, which were good."
4,"We have been to LaVecchia's several times with this being our first review.  Parking is easy and dry in the Hearst tower and with LaVecchia validating a ticket it is free.  The walk/ride down is nice and the atmosphere is great with businessfolk, and upscale patrons.. RiRa, Luce, and a beautiful courtyard are just outside the building add to the great location.  If you make a reservation, LaVecchia's is pretty easy to get into.  Each time we have arrived we have been seated while large parties were being seated.  The wait staff have been prompt., and we have not had to wait too long for our drinks.  The appitizer has been a bit too salty each time, bu the main entre food has been great!!!   We have returned several times when we have thousands of options here in the Queen city area."
4,"I'm rating this place 4 stars just, because it's not super cheap it's about average pricing! I called only 15 minutes before for a gel manicure they told me to come right in! When I got there they had everything all set for me I didn't have to wait at all. THEY HAVE SO MANY GEL COLORS!! I couldn't make up my mind! All of the ladies seemed very friendly mine dealt with my change of mind of colors very nicely and was giving me suggestions, I could hear other surrounding customers very satisfied and chatting away happily with the staff. My manicurists spent time, I never felt rushed, even though I was there only an hour before closing! Highly recommend!"
4,Miss the 2.99 special but figured I would give them another try since don tortacos breakfast burrito seems to be getting smaller and smaller. May go here now. Still wish there salsa was a little thicker and had more heat less vinegar taste.
4,"No complaints here! We stopped by on a rainy and cloudy day last week, the kind of day where you shouldn't be craving frozen yogurt but have to get some anyway.\n\nI opted for the snickerdoodle and peanut butter flavors with andies mints on top. The yogurt was the perfect texture and temperature, not too creamy or runny.\n\nAmbience: a little cheesy but there is a fair amount of seating for a yogurt shop. I really like that they post the calories up on the wall, even if it is kind of an eyesore.\n\nOverall a very nice store, well-maintained, and friendly service. Will be back when I'm in the area."
4,"Hubby and I both had the Chili Cheese Dog. Yummm! Perfectly cooked hot dog, snapped when you bit into it! Perfect proportion of chili so you can still eat it with your hands! The only thing I would change is the cheese.. Would have preferred shredded cheese rather than the Kraft singles.. But still delicious, and a perfect snack right on the strip!"
4,"First things first, I don't have a car. So I'm a captive audience for County Market, which is the closest store to my apartment. County Market has a good selection, and I rarely if ever have trouble finding things. It was funny how at the beginning of the school year certain items were just GONE, but I attribute that to people coming back and everyone needing soy sauce, ketchup, etc. However, I went there the other day and there was only one sort of tofu, which my friend informed me was not the best type. This is a small quibble, though, and I'm sure it happens in other stores.\n\nFor me the only thing I don't like about County Market is the state of produce. Often times I've picked up fruit or veggies and they've been close to going bad or already there. Or I'll buy bananas and they'll be so green I can't eat them for a week. I don't mind going through fruits and veggies and finding good ones, but if there aren't any good that makes it a but difficult. In general, I like this place and I'll continue to come back."
4,"Dropped in for a coffee to go...it's damn good coffee!  It tasted familiar and I asked if they roasted their beans or ordered it from somewhere in Canada and the barista let me know the beans I was having was from 49th Parallel in Vancouver!  So Vancourites, if you're missing your awesome coffee from home you should drop by here.\n\nI also ordered a scone which was also delicious and was on my way.  I'm not to sure about the amenities at the shop but it's a cool little space but I think the people watching might be at a minimum unless something is happening at the convention center since it's off a smaller street in Old MTL.\n\nOh yeah - staff was really friendly"
4,Fresh seafood everyday. We ordered some oysters asked for them to be shucked and mosey on over to the watering hole for delicious beers and wine. \nAll the fresh meats seafood and salads here are delicious. Grab some food and hang out with a beer or wine. Great people watching. \nEmployees are super friendly and helpful. One of the best grocery stores around and hey there is even a bar :)
4,"We just stayed at the Monte Carlo and we wanted to do a nice steak dinner for Saturday night.  Being 6 dudes, we were not disappointed.  They gave us 2 for 1 drink specials and sat us at a great table.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is really nice, only bad this is it is in open view of the casino floor.  Monte Carlo isn't the classiest hotel on the strip, so takes away a little bit of the steak experience when you look out at smokey gamblers and big screen TVs.  But I digress...\n\nThe steak was excellent.  They have a 120 oz steak for 6 on the menu, so of course we got it.  Came out as an excellent Mound of Meat presentation, but totally classy.  Cooked to perfection as any expensive steakhouse should do it.  Came with sides and dipping sauces, both excellent additions to the meal.\n\nStaff was friendly and efficient, which is always appreciated.  They gave us free entry into Brand \""after hours\"" as the lounge portion turns into a club at night.  We rolled in there after midnight, and it was not a hot spot.\n\nBottom line:  Great steakhouse, bad nightclub.  Only in Vegas."
4,"Overall, the experience was pretty good.  I got a regular mani and pedi for $35.  An up-sale to gel was offered, but there was no pressure to take it.  Staff was efficient, but could be abrupt due to the language barrier.  The main detraction from this place is when you enter.  You smell the fumes, and they are potent, so if that matters to you (whether you are sensitive to smells, pregnant, etc), you may want to pass. Also, it would be helpful to have a dedicated cashier.  Overall, this place is efficient, inexpensive, and provides a decent mani/pedi/"
4,"Now THIS is how an arena should be built; the steep constuction of its grandstands and mezz, the numerous lux boxes ringing the ice inbetween, the club areas below the arena floor and behind the goal, the magnificent sightlines and the Canadian beer.  \n\nIf Phoenix ever 'got into' hockey, they would really appreciate how loud this barn could get.  Its architecture is custom built for noise and intimidation, as it lends the feeling of fans hovering over the rink.  The transformation into music hall is actually quite impressive given that large arenas are life-sponges for touring acts.  \n\nMy only complaint is the sleepy, conformed bedroom community in which it was built.  Glendale couldn't be more sterile and boring if they replaced it with Pensacola, Florida.  The drive out here kills any attempts at a rowdy, drunken night of hockey or nationalgnarlyrockband, due to the impending day-trip back to civilization from the arena; and the ridiculous name befitting of its lame, corporate surrounding and immediate, and similarly foolishly monicker'ed neighbor to the west."
4,"Great food!! Small & limited seating if outdoor patio not open. But worth the wait! Clean food, vegan, vegetarian options ! Great flavor! Pho soup yummy & fresh rolls! I will be back!"
4,"Trump hotel didn't disappoint. We were greeted with kind employees and that continued all week. The room was very nice, clean and spacious. Shower was huge. \n\nI dropped 1 star because of the uncomfortable pillows and the train whistle early morning but neither took away from the experience. \n\nPool was nice but get there early for a lounge chair. \n\nDid not try the restaurants but did try the muffins and fruit at the coffee stand and they were great. \n\nWe didn't mind the lack of casino as this led to a much quieter and smoke free lobby. I would surely return."
4,"This location of the famous Madison Original Pancake House is much less busy, well hidden behind nearby hotel.  Staff is very nice, efficient & professional.  More parking at this location than the other (which was all construction & traffic when we tried to go).  Great quality food!  Lots of favorites listed in other reviews.  We haven't had anything bad, try whatever you'd like!\n\nThe red neon sign may or may not be lit up, it's about 1/2 way down the strip mall."
4,Gorgeous hotel! Didn't stay here but did you know Carlos from the food channel has a bakery here?!?! WHAT WHAT?!?! Yummerz. Be prepared for 1+ hour long wait though.
4,"It's at least open till 9:30, amazing in this \""24 hour\"" town and it tastes great.  Can't beat a 7.95 dinner special with drink, egg roll and soup.  If they deliver to UNLV, it's a five."
4,Not too shabby lunch deals. NOT DOS GRINGOS ANYMORE.  NOW CALLED ROCKY POINT CANTINA. I dug it. $2 coronas and tacos. looks really cool inside.
4,"We're am I? Philly? \nMaybe, I've never been. but if I were my cheese steak would taste like this. So good.\nPepper, onion ratios were perfect. The steak was great and the cheese wiz was tasty. The bread is brought in from Philly. Soft with a crunchy shell. Nice.\nThe pizza is also fresh and hand tossed. The big slices are filling.\nBut Spinelli's is more than that. They have appetizers, salads, desserts, Stromboli and other sandwiches. Bummed, no brew yet but any day now. \nMac and cheese bites are a good app choice.\nLast words... authentic, relaxing and non pretenses. Enjoy."
4,"Super small joint. I had the tonkotsu with thin noodles and the hub hub had the spicy ramen with thick, wavy noodles. \nThe tonkotsu noodles were pretty thick for being labeled \""thin\"", which works out for the better because I prefer thick ramen noodles. \nThe first time we went here I thought it was one of the best ramen I have ever had but this time, though still good, it isn't the best. \nWith that said, for the price you can't beat it!"
4,"Fantastic!  Clean, fairly priced, great service and delicious food - you could not ask for more than that in a restaurant!"
4,"Linda is amazing! I came to her by chance when looking for a nail tech to do my nails for my engagement photos. \n\nShe had just moved into her new place at Salon Boutique so luckily for me she didn't have a lot appointments that day. Linda was super nice and so easy to talk with. .\n\nI have been coming to Linda now since beginning of March (not long) but I couldn't imagine going anywhere else. She makes sure that your happy with her service before letting you leave. I lucked out when I found Linda!\n\nCome here for gels, acrylic, refills, manis and pedis, shellac, etc. She even gives your arms and hands a massage! Love it!!"
4,"At first, Outside Inn seemed just like any other neighborhood bar--nothing special. The name, however, had me intrigued as it was rather humorous. \n\nUpon entering this bar/restaurant, I liked the rustic wooden decor with exposed wooden \""log\"" beams and the overall \""woodsey\"" feel. The bar area seemed dark and there were plenty of tv's (although none that I could see were large screen). The dining area was rather small and the decor colors were dull. I would have preferred a little more exposed wood to match the rest of the decor, instead of the vinyl, blue booth seating areas. \n\nThe food was surprisingly good. Sweet potato fries pleasantly surprised in their flavor and consistency and prime rib tasted better than most other neighborhood places out there. The prices were reasonable and the draft beer selection was vast; however, prices were a little higher than average for a place such as this. Service was very quick and friendly. I would recommend this place and will come here again when I'm in a mood for some beers and some good prime rib. Nice neighborhood place to relax and unwind."
4,I got a piece of red velvet cake. The frosting is so rich and creamy with a very buttery finish and LOTS of cream cheese. The cake is tasty but dry. Good thing there was lots of amazing frosting to cover that flaw up. The place looked like a trendy spot you would find in NYC with prices to match. The staff was super friendly though.
4,"You have to understand what this place is in order to get the full enjoyment of it. Is it \n\nMy group of friends had a great time, and in the end, didn't mind coughing up the $17 just to get in the door. They dress you up in a parka and Uggs, and give you gloves for your glass. You then drop off all of your electronics and other belongings in a locker, and walk into a refrigerated room set at 50 degrees before progressing to the bar itself. \n\nEverything is truly made of ice, from the tables and benches, to the chandeliers, even the glasses themselves! I really enjoyed it for the novelty."
4,"The two most important words to remember when going here are: Moscow mule.\n\nForget everything else; that's what you want. The jukebox has issues, as others have noted. The beer selection is decent, but there is far better in near proximity. The food is decent, but nothing to keep me coming back. What will keep me coming back, however, is the moscow mules. The first few I had there were made with cucumber vodka, and hot damn were they tasty! On another visit, I had a couple made with a vodka infused with mint and I can't even remember what else which one of the bartenders made herself.\n\nOh yes, speaking of the bartenders, they are awesome. Be nice to them, treat them well, and they will be awesome to you in return.\n\nSo in summary: Food, decent; Beer, decent; Moscow mules, delicious; Bartenders, awesome."
4,"Considering the first reviewer, I wouldn't recommend taking their services from a hotel.\n\nHowever, they do offer shuttle service from the airport. You prepay, so there is no way the driver can hammer you for more money.  Just look for signs at baggage claim that say \""Airport Shuttles\"" or something like that.\n\nThere are actually two separate companies.  This one was a bit more expensive, but the other one only took cash.  And I forgot to get cash before leaving for Vegas.  So I had to go with this one so I can charge it.\n\nUse the airport shuttles, it's cheaper. I think it was $6 or so per person to the hotel.  Much cheaper than a cab.  They have the prices posted outside so you can check it out when you arrive."
4,"I lived in Maryland for 20 years and I love steamed crab legs. This place was very good and I am so glad that  I went despite some of  negative reviews. I have wanted to goto this place for years, but have not because I don't live very close to either of the locations and my husband does not like eating at chain restaurants. \n\nOur waitress, Elyse, was very nice and gave us great recommendations for dinner selections. The Bloody Mary was delicious and they put a crab leg in the drink as garnish!\n\nThe service was relatively quick for seating and service. I did hear one of the waitresses say they weren't very crowded that particular evening. The serving amounts were ample. There was a crowded table next to us  and I noticed they stopped talking for a good 15 minutes when their food first arrived. That's usually a good sign of a good meal. \n\nMy entire family enjoyed this place and we will be going back."
4,"Yeah, right, this chicken is not fried? ARE YOU SURE? Yes, that it what I was asking the cashier because it was crispy, and juicy, and looked and tasted like fried chicken. Just without the fried. Its BROASTED. I am not sure of the exact meaning, but to me the meaning is, secrectly fried chicken that is better for you than normal fried chicken. \nAND they have malts, shakes, a self serve yogurt bar, sandwiches, and of course the ever so famous Dole whip. \nI personally enjoy taking a day trip to Boulder City and enjoying the scenery. However, if that is not your thing, this place is on the outskirts and you do not need to go into the town. They also have a drive-thru. But be patient because they cook everything fresh to order. It is worth the wait. \nA small hole in the wall, that literally moved from a shack across the street to a full building. Clearly they are doing something right. \nBC has a lot of hidden gems, don't skip this one, you will regret it!"
4,"Its a Chipotle.  Ya get what you expect.  The kids love it.  Wifey can eat healthy there.  \nI don't really consider Chipotle to be very good as a mexican cuisine, but for what they serve, its darn tasty.  love their chips, and their guac.  and their pork is excellent, too.\nNot saying this specific location was, but be sure to watch when they are dishing the protein; sometimes they ca be skimpy on the meat, especially if the line is long."
4,"I haven't been this overwhelmed with excitement since I went to Disneyland.  Immediately upon entering I was taken back by the decor, fish tanks, waterfall and life like animals on display.  I spent two hours in here, I wanted to see every inch.  \n\nThe only bad part of the experience was the lady at the fudge stand.  She was not a happy camper but the delicious fudge made up for it.\n\nThis place is way out of my budget and I would never buy any of the necessities for outdoor life here but I purchased some novelty things and will continue to come back."
4,"Have always enjoyed the food and thought it to be of very good quality. \n\nThe service is lacking due to the focus on hiring the nearby students from the university. On one occasion we made reservations, and while being seated the hostess tried to place us at a table. We prefer a booth and asked to be seated at one but she refused saying that they were not yet seating in that area. We insisted, and this went back and forth several times before we said that we will leave. She finally allowed us to sit at a booth but then made a dramatic show about placing us there before stomping off. \n\nIt was bizarre and not the typical experience, but just a cautionary sign of what comes when staffing students."
4,"Pinnacle course shines at Troon North - a real treat.  Monument course nice, not as inspiring. Course conditions good, but not great.  Nice selection of golf merchandise in the pro shop."
4,"Once I find something I like, I usually stay with it. This place is no exception. I've been coming here for over a year now.  I love coming here for my monthly gel manicure. As much as customers they get, it is amazing the staffs remember repeat customers.  One of them asked me for things happened a few months ago.\n\nFriendly staffs are easy to talk to and they know how to pamper you really well.\nI am looking forward to my next monthly therapeutic with them."
4,"Somehow I lucked out and found a place to live that's walking distance from just about everything that could possibly matter to me, and that includes what is probably the premier ski and ride shop in the desert.\n\nSki Pro is stocked better than the ski shop I frequent in Colorado, and unlike the Colo stores, Ski Pro wants to move stuff: Sales, sales and more sales. I just picked up a ski suit for my kid that was marked down from $175 to $59. It's still the middle of the season, folks.  They also appear to have a great selection of skis and boards, but that's a once in a blue moon type of purchase for me. Suffice it to say that they are stocked up with just about everything I could imagine needing for my wintertime hobby. And they are basically in the backyard of the Biltmore.\n\nAs far as the help goes, it's about average for this sort of business: No more subservient or attentive than absolutely necessary. These guys and girls are from a background of leisure and are working in a leisure business. Most probably come from the sort of middle-class families who can afford to ski. Asking them to be smiley and super-attentive is contrary to the spirit of these places--it's like expecting surfers to wear suits and ties. At least they didn't seem stoned, paranoid and semi-hostile-- like most ski shop employees in Colorado.\n\nSo check it out, and hang loose about the service, dude . . . Way . . ."
4,"Never had a bad meal at any location...  The ground beef hummus is the best hummus I've had in my life!  Tonight I tried the coconut shrimp for the first time and I ate the whole thing!   It was outstanding!\n\nThe only reason they are losing a star is because we got there around 8:30, they closed at 9:30 and we could feel them trying to get out soon.  At about 9:00 the entire staff of 3 sat down to eat a meal in the restaurant in front of customers.  Our waitress was still very nice and attentive so I don't want to complain about service, but it was a little off-setting.  Could they not have waited another 30 minutes until the restaurant was closed or go in the back and take a few bites?  Not very professional at all and made it feel like we were a burden.\n\nI definitely want to reiterate that despite the hiccup, our service was good and the food was still excellent... Would not keep me from returning by any means or recommending it to friends and family!"
4,"If Ii were to get one chance at ordering a coffee or a chocolate milkshake, I would order it from Courier Cafe. Even though it's an old fashioned kind of spot; as in, old carpet, old(er) waitresses who may or may not be friendly, and old silverware. But there's nothing like a good old fashioned milkshake that's too think to get through a straw, and comes with the overflow in the metal mixing cup. Even on a cold winter day, I'll make my way over to the Courier Cafe. Any self-respecting milkshake connoisseur might do the same."
4,"I like this place! It is not a 5 star burger place but it is a solid 4. They use good meet, and even though it is not totally original, they let you feel like you are in control of how it is cooked and you top it yourself.\n\nThe atmosphere in the restaurant is kind of a throw back, and they generally have some good music....although I did hear a Morrissey song, but I was able to block it out. Its not quite a 50 dinner theme but it is worth taking a look at.\n\nI would for sure go for the 2/3 burger and from there the toppings are up to you."
4,"Originally I was not sure about coming here since I thought the name of the restaurant was gimmicky but this has to be one of the best places in the Phoenix area to get some Pho. I was pleasantly surprised about the quality of the noodle soups here. It seemed quite busy in there during my visit and the service did feel a bit rushed, but it doesn't bother me much as I was there just for a quick meal and I know how busy they can get at a restaurant like that. I plan to come back here to try out some of their other offerings!"
4,"Everyone has already said it all.  Solid but unmemorable diner food, in a place that is divinely Vegas.\n\nIt's a must-see.  Ambience is 6 stars.\n\nThe rest doesn't matter much.  It's edible.  You won't get food poisoning.  Good drunk food alternative to Denny's.  Worth the trip even if it's out of the way."
4,"I enjoy playing at Tuscany. It is one of Las Vegas' newer golf courses.\nMy first time at Tuscany - the Club house was in a converted quonset hut / tent. \nThey now sport a beautiful club house and restaurant.\nThe club initially had some problems growing grass in  this arid part of Vegas, so the team from Rhodes Ranch came in took it over and the course has been blooming ever since. \nRhodes Ranch is the \""sister\"" course and you can often get supurb package deals for plying both courses.\nThe course is well laid out with a number of sand traps that seem to play right to my driving distance. \nThere is enough water on the course to splash a few misplaced shots\nThe course winds past the beautiful stone clocktower has spacious fairways.\nThe theme of the course centers around wine and vineyards making it fairly unique.\nI think this is an excellent course for the price you pay. \nYou have to drive a bit further than some of the Summerlin courses but it is a super experience."
4,"I've been to Trifecta a few times now and have always been pleasantly surprised with the artists they are featuring. The staff has been friendly with questions about the pieces as well in all my visits. Quite a number of pieces that are for sale were in a range that a \""normal person\"" could purchase and collect. It's the one disagreeable thing I have with art, is that sometimes the value is so inflated, it's untouchable. \n\nMy most recent visit was Las Vegas / Nevada photography that accompanies the Focus on Nevada spread in this months issue of Desert Companion. There was a contest for submissions and it just so happened one of our own, Anthony M. , was selected. I support anything my best friends do. \n\nThe one thing is despite being a small space, I feel that the past events I've been to here have all been handled very well with food and drink service. \n\nDefinitely get lost in the Arts Factory - make a day of it and make sure to stop by the Trifecta. No culture naysayers, just walk around this street and look with your special eyes - there is something growing."
4,"The terrace is always full. Get there early. The lineup  is worth the wait. New \""porchetta\"" sandwich is a winner. Just like Mama's home cooking. Dog-friendly. We brought our dogs and they brought water for them. How nice is that!"
4,"I have been to Chandelier a few times, it's really beautiful. Go to the 2nd (in between) level and order the Lemon Verbena, not on the menu. Pay an extra couple dollars each to get extra flowers for everyone in your group. You chew the flower (don't swallow) and it will do a weird frothing thing in your mouth for at least 5 minutes. It feels like there's a little fountain in there. The first time, my boyfriend gave me one and I hit him afterwards. But of course I had to repay the favor to my group of 5 the next time I was in Cosmo with a Bachelorette party. VERY entertaining to watch the facial expressions of your friends! And well worth the $23 I spent for the drink + another 3 flowers.\n\nChandelier is always hoppin even at 4 or 5 a.m. Why only 4 stars? One time they made me a terrible cocktail. Also, the bartenders at the bar itself tend to be really bitchy... at least to women."
4,"Great atmosphere,  very good menu, excellent service,  and lots of beers to choose from. The only thing about this place is the parking.  \n\nIf you want a quiet place this isn't it. It's called a social house for a reason.  Go for the food, the drinks, and the crowd.  Plenty of TVs to catch a game. \n\nEnjoy!"
4,"Food was great. The crab cakes are the BEST I've tasted. Only the bottom of a huge pile of crab meat was breaded to keep the shape. The crab was sooooo tasty and not ruined with heavy sauces. This is our 4th time there in 2 months and have been consistently impressed by everyone from greeter on the way in to greeter saying good night as we leave. The only reason for 4 stars is the noise level is very high. Guess it's a eat, pay, get out philosophy although we were never rushed."
4,"I was pleasantly surprised by the food!  Its the spices that make the dishes.  We ended up here late one night and they happily served us.  Wait staff were very attentive and friendly- gave good recommendations when asked.\n\nI had a simple potato and beef dish which was served with some sort of dipping sauce that was TO DIE FOR, really spicy and so flavorful!  I poured it all over my meal!\n\nMy husband was less impressed, he says 3 stars, I say 4!"
4,"Love this place for the beer, food and shuffle board! Highly recommend the Mac and cheese with the added ghost pepper cheese and the broccoli salad... My only issue with this place is the vocalist of the band playing on the patio this Tuesday October 14th (not sure if it's an every Tuesday night thing or a one off performance)... Not that her vocals were bad, I actually enjoyed the band.  Her attire is simply something I've seen at establishments such as Sapphire's, which I think is great at such places, just not at a family restaurant."
4,"Although we were planning on going to the Pirates game, which we found out was sold out when we arrived. . .Bill and I decided our night would then consist of dinner and gambling so we picked the Tilted Kilt!\n\nFirst of all, just being blunt. . .if your a girl and your taking your man here and your the insecure type. . .pick somewhere else.  The girls here are scantily clad and attractive.  However, they were all super nice and helpful.  Im pretty unfazed by that type of atmosphere so it was easy for me to be relaxed and just enjoy the time with my man.  Its a cool place because like Mel said there are TV's everywhere and although we couldn't get into the game we were able to watch baseball right above us and keep current on the score.\n\nOnto the food, in my opinion. . .it was above average.  I had the fried chicken salad which was huge.  The lettuce was crisp romaine (my favorite!) and the honey mustard dressing was perfect.  The only downside to my meal was that they put mandarin oranges in my salad...just not my thing but oh well! Bill ordered the Irish Stew and he loved it!\n\nI would return to the Tilted Kilt again definitely. . .it is a little on the pricier side but, I think it will do well in Pittsburgh especially on the North Side!"
4,"Okay, to start off with, if you want to eat healthy, keep moving.  This is true southern comfort breakfast food and it was really good.  The staff even put up with two members of my party having a water fight in the middle of eating.."
4,Found this place because its close to work. I wish I can go here for lunch on a daily basis but my budget wont allow it! Sushi is always fresh and the staff is very friendly. I've had their all you can eat sushi($20) for dinner and managed to eat 3 rolls. Great deal if you ask me because each roll can be around $9-14. They have tons of rolls you can choose from. Also the complimentary fruit is a nice touch and makes you feel special. You will be glad you visited.
4,"I was grinning so hard when I finally made it here. Not just because it was a reprieve from the cold, but because it was only a mild shade of the picture the Yelp reviews painted (i.e. crackhouse, employees who can't speak English, dirty, so smelly it could knock you out, etc.) I was smiling because after debating whether or not I should go here (I wanted to make Tom Kha Gai), I saw for myself that it was A TOTALLY TYPICAL ASIAN GROCERY. I'm not talking H-Mart or E-Mart or Assi-- I'm talking like Chicago Food Corp. on Kimball or Brwyn Mawr Fresh Market (Yeah, I know some of you are laughing and nodding.) It was so funny thinking back on these reviews as I was checking out. Like, I was expecting something revolting. Too. Funny. \n\nSo yeah, it's totally fine. Don't let these crackers confuse you. It has a nice Asian stank in there. I'm still loling at that girl freaking her shit about seafood in boxes on the floor. Oh my god. Nevertheless, there are downsides to this place: cash and check only (you can pay a fee if you want to use a card), cramped as all hell, and dusty. \n\nI found my nuoc mam, chili oil, and fresh lemongrass. They have all the weird shit you need to make your stinky ass Asian dishes. They have a ton of cool sweets too."
4,"Thrift shops and superlatives naturally don't mix too well together, but this is the oldest charity shop in Scotland.  That fact alone is pretty impressive and so is the collection of donated book available in here, amidst the usual charity shop mainstays.\n\nI managed to spot popular classics such as Catch 22, Great Expectations and a huge pile of Goosebumps (remember those!) all at the expected dirt cheap price."
4,"Placed a to go order and the loopy girl taking it royally messed it up. But the manager brought out my correct order really quickly. Additionally, he let me keep the food that she had erroneously given me. Then he offered to refund the entire meal back onto my credit card. Way to go with great customer service!"
4,"While working at Shirts and Things, we'd order lunch from here every once in awhile. I'd always get the bread bowl soup and have them put half potato, half broccoli and cheese. A great combination! The bread itself was also good. I would always get the Gobbler too, which is like Thanksgiving between bread: turkey, cranberry sauce, and stuffing on marble rye. Delicious!\nThe delivery seemed pretty fast but the prices were a little high (around $7 for soup and bread or a sandwich is iffy for me)."
4,"Ate here twice during one of our trips while we stayed at the Venetian. We got to Vegas fairly late one evening and after unloading our things in our room we went downstairs not knowing where to eat and came across this place since it was opened late.\n\nIt was actually similar to Cheesecake and then I found out that they are from the same company. \n\nThere was absolutely no wait even for breakfast. So before we left to head back home, we got our breakfast here."
4,"Customer service is terrific. Everyone was so nice and accommodating. Everything is clean and organized. I love the way a lady in there did my eyebrows. I believe she is the owner. She's really precise and I love that. I recently came and got a pedicure and it felt kinda rushed. The foot scrub wasn't all that great, hence the one star removal but everything else is great. Definitely give this place a try."
4,"This food was De-lish. We went here last minute because we were staying at MGM grand and did not feel like making it out to the strip, glad we didn't. The food is served family style and are large portions. We had four people and ordered 5 items... it was the perfect amount of food and really good. We all especially enjoyed the lo mien and the orange chicken. \n\nThe atmosphere is fun but romantic. Ask for a table away from the entrance as to avoid noise from the food court. \n\nThe beer they have is not on the drink menu but are an affordable option. After paying way to much for drinks by the pool, these 12$ 36 oz beers were just what we needed. \n\nDefinitely worth checking out."
4,"Great Service, Clean Flavors, Big Menu\n\n\nWendy's Noodle Cafe has just become my favorite place called \""Wendys.\""  Sorry other Wendys; even though you're the spicy chicken mecca, I've found another.\n\nEverything we ordered was spectacular, and the friendly service sealed the deal, Wendy's is fantastic.  \n\nOur Order:\n\nPot Stickers - Perfect crisp on the dumpling and delicious pork/scallion stuffing.  Best Potsticker I've had in Las Vegas.\n\n\nBeef Short Ribs - Wendy's take on Kalbi - The beef had a nice sear on it while not being dry.  Not as good as Kalbi at many Korean spots, but still a very good appetizer.\n\nShredded Chicken w/ Vermicelli (noodle soup) - DELICIOUS combination of cilantro, kaffir Lime, and Chili.  This satisfying yet light soup is like your mom's chicken noodle soup with a passport. \n\nMalaysian Fried Rice - Served with chicken wings and squid balls.  The rice was really nice, tasting of subtle garlic, onion, turmeric, and lime.  It was moist without being mushy, and very wholesome.  The chicken wings were good not great, and the squid balls were forgettable.  The rice itself is a definite order though.\n\n\nMake sure your tongue's passport is up-to-date, because it's time for your tastebuds to see the world."
4,"I haven't tried all the pancakes in the country or even enough for a strong statistical argument, but the pancakes were as good as I could make at home, which is unexpected.  I had the \""famous corned beef hash,\"" which wasn't all that spectacular.  Might've been made with canned corned beef.\n\nThe combination of the atmosphere (this is a very old casino downtown) and the pancakes made this a terrific breakfast spot.  It they had good coffee, I'd give them five stars, but it's just institutional--though they did bring a pitcher of half and half with the first cup.  Institutional coffee is more acceptable with cream and sugar.\n\nThe pie case, as others have noted, looked really appealing.  If I get back, that will be what I have for breakfast. I noticed they had some breakfast specials, too, e.g., a pancake and bacon sandwich thing.\n\nParking in the area is kind of a problem, at least if you expect to not pay anything.  Might as well park in the valet lot for the casino--if they validate your stub the first hour is only fifty cents.  The tip is up to you, but it will probably be at least a couple more bucks if you're a real high rollin' Vegas kind of guy."
4,Went here for National cheesecake day and ate WAY too much cheesecake ! They were extremely busy offering half price cheesecake but the wait was short . I had the Godiva chocolate and OMG amazing ! If you're a choco fan this cakes for you . Very nice staff friendly prompt etc . will be going back soon Good job Cheesecake peeps !
4,"I bought a Groupon for this place for a full exam, -xrays, whitening trays, and a cleaning. When I arrived, I was warmly greeted by the office staff, who are cheerful and sweet. The entire office is pretty big and really nice. Lots of magazines and Tv's..etc.\nAs I went back, they told me they had to reschedule me for the cleaning and trays another da, because they were so busy. A little annoying, but sometimes these things happen. \nI came back the following week and had my cleaning done and I am happy as a clam. The office wasn't nearly as busy, and it was actually pretty quiet. The staff is awesome and the woman who did my cleaning was wonderful! I felt totally relaxed and calm, which is necessary when you are getting things jabbed into your teeth and gums for an hour. My teeth look and feel awesome.\nAnother woman took me back and did the impressions for my whitening tray. She was also really nice and bubbly.\nAll in all I am totally happy with this place and will be returning next week to get a cavity filled."
4,"My company usually booked me United every month I traveled.\nThey're my last hope out there.\nThey have been fairly consistent, on time, and friendly.\nDidn't lose my luggage a single time.\n(southwest lost it once, Delta screwed up bigtime and took 3 weeks)\nSo I'd give them a four star."
4,"Lobby- ya burgahs are da bomb...da bomb... nuff said. \n\nThe gentleman in front of me was regaling the owner with the deliciousness of his intended order...So, how could I turn down such a glowing review. I went with the burger and he got it right, the burger is da bomb. It is astounding how fresh the  bun, the pickles and lettuce are..crispness you can take and the burger is juicy.. The fries are absolutely addicting. Crinkle cut and taste amazing. Pippin' hot.. I love this place, Lobby ya burgahs are da bomb!"
4,"Anytime I am craving my grandmother's cooking, I grab something from Rose Tea to take home. I highly recommend the beef pancake roll and their house special rice cakes. You can't go wrong with anything on their menu and their bubble tea is the best I've had in Pittsburgh!"
4,"We tried this restaurant when we were in Las Vegas.  We had a group of eight.   The service here is great, very attentive and friendly.\n\nI had the chicken kiev which was crisp on the outside and juicy on the outside.  I had a cranberry cabbage salad that came with it which to me wasn't very flavorful, I would have preferred the red cabbage that others had.  \n\nOther members of our group ordered the pork, which was kind of dry.  The steak was good.  I had the mashed potatoes with my dinner instead of fries but I wish I would have ordered the fries.  They were home made, flavorful and delicious.\n\nWe had the cabbage rolls, herring and vegetable plate.   \nOthers in the group loved the cabbage rolls, me, not so much.  The herring was outstanding,  fresh and not too oily.  I was going to order the salmon but our server suggested the herring and I'm glad I took her advice.  The vegetable plate was displayed  beautifully   and everything on it was fresh.   The desserts were great as well\n\nOverall, the food was good , the service was excellent and the price was very reasonable.\n\nThe only downside to our visit is that when we exited we were accosted by a man who asked one of our party members \""to borrow 50 cents\"" .  It was a very unpleasant experience and I rwon't go into furhter details, but there is a liquor store in the same plaza and there were quite a few people loitering outside."
4,"Winner-Winner - Chicken Dinner\n\nI won!   All I can say is that the casino was nice and clean.    The people were friendly.\n\nI played some blackjack and won big so all i can say is \""Woohoo!\""\n\nI will be back - I found a chip I have to cashin :-)"
4,"This place was packed on Friday night! Every table was full of happy people getting their kbbq on! It smelt amazing from the get go and we were excited to eat some good Korean food. \n\nWe got the daeji bulgogi and the seafood tofu soup. The tofu soup was just the right spice and warmed our bellies. The meat came out sizzling and tasted sweet and spicy. I wished that the meat was cooked a little longer because I like a little char, but still yummy! The only downside was the side dishes. There were only a few that I liked: kimchi, seaweed and the fish cakes. The others were not as exciting like cole slaw and stuff. Not a huge deal though. \n\nI was still really happy with the food and would come back again!"
4,"Comme ca-\nLocated in cosmopolitan, may utilize opentable to reserve.\nThis place, we were seated by the side of the restaurant with amazing views! The food, we ordered roasted bone marrow (comes with shredded pork), their special of the day: fried pork cutlet with eggs and something else...and the pork shank. \nFirst, the bone marrow comes with 1 bone only, expensive but it does come with shredded pork, so it's actually plentiful. The appetizers special of the day, well i know it's pork cutlet, it was amazing, quite a bug appetizer but a bit too salty...the pork shank is huge!! So if you're bringing only one other guest, this is a lot of food, we had leftover which was placed in a nice cosmo bag. The pork shank is tender, falls off the huge bone for the most part, they had a special cocktail for the day, included some bubbly inside, pretty good, forgot the name already. Our waitress was nice and quick, she knows her dishes and specials well, good recommendations by her, will visit again, yum yummm"
4,"I had a really wonderful meal here and one of the most memorable in my life. The wine pairings with the tasting menu were fantastic. The service was exquisite. We also sat at a table next to Madeleine Albright, and she was drinking up a storm. She had her own bottle of red wine in a decanter, while the rest of the table was drinking white. So, getting tipsy with a former Secretary of State always makes for an awesome night.\n\nWarning though, the amuse bouche was some sort of lobster gel\u00e9e/foam. All I know is that it didn't taste like lobster, at least fresh lobster. The waiter acknowledged that many customers complained about this but they still served the damn thing. I had to take an extra big swig of wine.\n\nHowever, the rest of the tasting menu was served swimmingly and tasted fantastic."
4,"Really nice place!  My filet --medium rare -- was delicious!  My husband said his could have used more flavor, but that's his own fault for ordering it medium well!  The asparagus side was a little small, and a bit overcooked.  Baked potato was perfect!  Loved the bread assortment they brought out!  French onion soup was good but think the fresh herb they added overpowered the other flavors.  Nice wine selection--gosh I hate paying quadruple the wine store price, though!  Bring back BYOB!  Nice staff and loved our cozy booth--made the din not so overpowering and we could hear each other without yelling!  Really, really yummy steak, but it should be for $33.00!!!"
4,"Pretty good pizza!  Thin crispy crust that's both crispy and has good chew. Tasty sauce with a hint of kick.  Good toppings, too.\n\nIt's a great choice if you're staying on the Strip and don't want to pay obscene room service rates for questionable pizza.  Our pizza was delivered to us at our south-strip hotel at no extra charge by a very friendly driver."
4,"Top of the Mornin'\n\nPopped in over the weekend while looking for a place to eat, our group wanted to eat at Capo's but we didn't know you have to make reservations in advanced, cause it sells out. Our group sneaked in this quite retreat and enjoyed our time away from the hustle and buss ell of Vegas. \n\nThe atmosphere is very chill, and relaxing. We talked with some other tourist and had a friendly conversation.  We ordered a fish and chip happy hour snack for $2.99 and was happy with the food quality. Our bartender lady was nice and recommended a great place for Italian food."
4,"Whenever I travel, I like to find an Ethiopian restaurant. It's usually in a part of town one wouldn't experience whilst staying in the business district. And it's usually an eatery, run by a husband and wife team, that's friendly to solo eaters, as I sometimes am.\nOn top of all that, Ethiopian food is HONEST--it's meat and veggies in straight-up yummy sauces, good for your body and mind!\n\nHere in Tempe, Lalibela is a good example of that down-home mom-and-pop cooking, Eth-style.\n\nIt's also a great spot to bring your friends and family. When you do, try the sampler platters; they're the best way to eat Ethiopian, emphasizing the communal nature of the feast (eaten with hands, not flatware).\n\nThe teas are delicious too."
4,"All I need to say here is...mango cream ale...just came out today and I downed 23 ounces of it. MMMMM!  I would totally come back just for the drink!!! But the menu is fairly large and service was great.  We got the last table on a Tuesday at 8:30 PM for dinner so obviously this is a hot joint.  My sweetie got a beef burrito and ate the entire plate.  Good place for beer!!!! Loved the view of the huge restaurant, very cool."
4,"Delicious and well-priced slices. Definitely going to marry the garlic knots one day. It's pretty packed on the weekends, especially after Alive After Five, but the service is quick."
4,"This is one of my 2 year old's favorite places to go. It's all about the cool slides built into the hill, up to date playground equipment, and when it's hot outside the water features keep him very entertained. Henderson takes care of it's parks but this is one of the better ones in their system. \n\n4 Stars without question!"
4,"I ordered the Harvest Chopped Salad and Banana, Espresso, Pistachio, and Date Muffin. The salad had the best combination of fresh fruits, creamy goat cheese, and dressing. I would not complain if I ate one of those every day! The muffin was so delicious, what a combination of flavors! The only down side for me is that it was quite pricey. Don't get me wrong, the food was mouth-watering, but I wouldn't want to spend that much money on a regular basis."
4,As you walk down the hall you can smell this place from a mile away. I have yet to have a bad meal there! I would totally suggest trying to get a seat on the patio overlooking the fountains. Great meal and a great view... it would be a great spot to propose... just saying
4,"If you are looking to socialize or bring a group for people out that haven't experienced Tempe this is the place to be. The drinks selection is good, the food is a little better than regular bar food. The real highlights of Caseys is the Atmosphere and the staff. Located in the downtown college neighborhood the place is always bussling with people smiles and conversations. The door guys can be a little rough around the edges so don't try to get in the door if you had anything to drink prior to your visit. Also check out the upstairs if yo can sneak by the wait staff its a haunted room!"
4,My first taste of boba was at an Asian market out in the West Valley.  Since that time I've found a few places closer to me that offer boba.  Boba Tea House is my favorite.\n\nThey offer a wide variety of flavors and most can be mixed.  I don't venture into paths unknown with my drinks and always grab a lychee snow with boba.  \n\nI've been impressed with each visit.  The only draw back is that I don't feel comfortable hanging out there.  If you're over 18 you will most likely be the oldest person in the joint.  Typically I drop by for a boba after shopping at the market next door and bail when my drink is ready.  I imagine it makes a good hangout place for a younger crowd.\n\nThe crowd won't deter me.  I will continue going to Boba Tea House for all my boba needs.
4,My buds and I stumbled (literally) upon this cool find inside the MGM Grand. The three of us were all very happy with our personal pies. Very unique thin crust and cheap for the strip @ 12 bucks. Great find.
4,"We recently held our wedding reception at the Bentley Projects.  It was an unexpected, stylish place to hold a wedding reception, which is exactly what we were looking for.  \n\nThe gallery is large and spacious and absolutely stunning at night.  The lighting is perfect and what better backdrop for photos than original art pieces?  \n\nThe art is contemporary, from artists all over the country.  Unfortunately, I could not afford any of there pieces...pretty pricey.  Ahhh...maybe someday. \n\nThe bookstore no longer exists, but the restaurant, City Bakery, is a perfect stop for lunch and then head over to the gallery to check out the exhibit.  They are also open late for First Friday's."
4,"I really like this buffet! We went straight to the seafood section! I was ecstatic to see that their King Alaskan Crab were already cracked and ready for you! It was so good, I think that was the best dish there. I had seriously 3-4 plates of food, with crab cakes, salmon, chicken and lamb shiskabobs(they were okay), hummus and pita (Stay away) dolmas, sushi, won tons(really yummy), dim sum(yummy, too!), plus 2 plates of dessert. I especially loved their chocolate covered strawberries. I didn't eat the meat, the steak, but the bf did and said it wasn't that good. Overall, I would come back here, but a lot hungrier. We had a HUGE nasty strawberry daquiri on our way to Planet Hollywood which filled up our bellies. Wish I was hungrier, but hey, that didn't stop me from eating like a horse! (As always =P)"
4,"Our Sunday night plans turned out lamer than expected, and RA's reverse happy hour saved the evening! All dressed up on a Sunday evening with nowhere special to go? Ra will do!\n\nSunday nights they 'transform' the bar in to the 'Flying Fish Lounge.' A DJ sets up right around 8pm in the corner of the bar and the beats stay bumping til close. Though the beats are nothing out of this world, it just spice up the bar area, but doesn't cause too much commotion in the restaurant area...\n\nDrinks & food at RA are overpriced regularly, but as mentioned, for HH, you can't complain. The prices range from $2-$7 for both drinks & sushi specials. Big rolls like the amazing Las Vegas Roll & probably the shrimp tempura are $7, basic rolls like spicy tuna are $4, & I think the nigri is $3.. Hot sake - $1, Big Kirin beers are only like $3, & their mix drinks range, but are never that impressive.\n\nThat night I ordered two rolls (the toosty maki is always a winner if you like eel sauce) & some yummy Albacore appetizer and my tab was $19. My girlfriend ordered dessert, and it looked amazing! An asian spin on the banana split, it was served like a tempura sushi roll, but instead was fried ice cream smothered in chocolate sauce, whipped cream, strawberries, etc. looked amazing!\n\nOh Ra, you may be a chain but I'm glad to have you close."
4,"This is a place for the highend vintage shopper. Its pretty expensive, but I will say the store is pretty kick ass inside.  If you don't have patients or you're new to driving, do not park in front of their building. The only way to get out is to back up onto central avenue!"
4,My first time going here I wasn't expecting much but it ended up being very good. The sub I ordered was HUGE! It was extremely filling. I thought there was no way I could finish it but it was to good to put down. There's alot of room for parking in the back which was nice and there's a little bagel shop next door.
4,"this place is hard to find, but when you get there it's worth it, had the link, brisket, rib combo, was great."
4,"I love this pool. It's really pretty. Very roomy so even though it was crowded, it didn't feel cramped. Drinks are ridiculous expensive. Luckily, I only paid for one. But honestly, drinks on the strip are so overpriced wherever you go.\n\nGuy at the door, James, was great. Not like the assholes you usually have to deal with at these places.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for a fun day club in Vegas, I'd highly recommend this one. We all had a blast."
4,"I have eaten here for both lunch and dinner. The food is always fresh and served relatively quickly no matter what time of day you visit. The staff has always been friendly and informative.\n\nTypical AYCE sushi rules apply (no sharing with non/AYCE guests, don't waste the rice, you have approximately an hour to eat, etc.)\n\nSome favorites: Crab roll, 911, Friday 13th v Jason, Spider roll, spiderman, cowgirl, japanese lasagna...there are so many to choose from\n\n\nThis is a small place so you could end up waiting for a table in the evening hours. The good thing is, the service remains at all time high because they can only serve so many people at once. If you can't get a table, order to-go! It's made fresh when you order it, unlike the cold dry sushi that you get at RA!"
4,"Took my 4-year-old for a treat. Disappointed that we couldn't eat our treats there (just one tiny table). The selection was just okay: red Velvet, chocolate, birthday cake, yellow cake, Oreo, German chocolate, and peanut butter cup. Everything was already made. The cupcakes were moist with a generous amount of sweet frosting. I found my chocolate cake to be slightly bitter, but overall good. Another bummer was no drinks (at least water would be good on hot summer days). Overall the cupcakes were good not great. They will do well with the location though."
4,"It took QUITE a while to get my tire replaced (about an hour and a half) but they were working as fast as they could. I also appreciated how they didn't try to sell me on the most expensive tires they had, the guy working at the counter told me that a lower-priced tire was actually better than the most expensive one."
4,"My son got the Pechuga ala Plancha which was amazing.  My daughter had a quesadilla which she really liked. The meat in my tacos was tasty but very dry, making them a little tough to eat. My margarita and side order of guacamole was also good.\n\nI've been in Madison over twelve years and never knew this place was rucked back here. I will be back."
4,Surprisingly better than I expected! The brisket was very flavorful and moist. The ribs were ok. I wouldn't recommend it. It's a bit tougher so you must must use your hands and get dirty eating it. The Mac and cheese was creamy. The food were not hot but didn't expect it to. It's quite expensive but very filling!
4,"I'd read about Pop's in LV Weekly awhile ago and when the Groupon for this place popped up, we seized the opportunity and ventured over to Decatur to check it out.  I was surprised to discover it was an outdoor establishment with no indoor seating, and wasn't sure what to expect since the place doesn't look like much at first glance. \n\nBut looks can be deceiving, and I was VERY impressed with the food -- everything is made to order, so even though we sat outside in the 60 degree evening to eat our phillies at one of the tables, the food was piping hot.  I liked that they had a few options for cheese since I'm not a cheese whiz fan, so I got provolone instead with peppers and onions and it was delish.  My boyfriend got the same and we shared the crunchy fried green beans with marinara sauce, which were very good.  Portions were pretty big so you definitely get a lot of food for your money.  I'd definitely go here again!"
4,"This place was highly recommended to me and as an American I was naive, I walked in on a Friday night after drinks and appetizers with some friends.  And load and behold there was a seat at the bar no wait, elbow to elbow with a local with her cycling helmet and a gentlemen dressed in a finely tailored suit.  And I am wearing a shorts and a t-shirt (us Americans are so horrible at dressing up while on vacation.\n\nThe service overall was really good, traditionally trained bartenders dishing out fine wines and suggestions for diners.  This place is straight up traditional, with the right food, service, and ambiance.  For me I had a glass of red wine and the duck confit salad, I am not normally a salad kind of guy, but I did not regret getting the salad.  The duck was seasoned well, the meat was moist, the greens were fresh (this is the end of August by the way) and the balance of the bitters and the sweets of the greens and the sweet meat was on point.\n\nThis is one salad I would eat again, but there are so many other great things on the menu if I was to go here again."
4,"So, I think I have figured it out: Stoney's is a great place for cheap taco's & beer during football. It's fun at night for country line-dancing. It's just not a great restaurant, not even for lunch. Both times that we have gone to sit down & eat we were disappointed with the food, service & price.\nSo, it's not my choice for dining out, that's ok, cuz on a Monday afternoon, don't be surprised to see me hanging on to the bar eating cheap food & pounding beers."
4,"I go here mostly for the izakaya feel and less for the food.  I used to frequent izakayas on a weekly basis when I lived in Japan and sometimes I just want to feel nostalgic so I swing by Ichiza. \n\nThe food is about as good as an average run of the mill izakaya found anywhere in Japan.  I have a feeling most of the 5 star reviews on here are coming from people who have never ate at a finer izakaya in Japan.  The selection could be a bit better, I would prefer an all Japanese kitchen staff, though their wait staff is all Japanese.  \n\nSo for the food, 3 stars.\n\nFor the kind and welcoming staff, 5 stars.  Ambiance and izakaya feel get 4 stars.\n\nDon't come here expecting an amazing Japanese food adventure.  Come here with friends expecting some cold beer, lively chatter, and friendly service!"
4,"Enjoyed breakfast in this place very much. Warm and cosy. Great espresso, delicious breakfast sandwiches (we had a \""Biker's Dream\"", and it was amazing!) And, they have wine and \""alcohol infused\"" coffee drinks! What a find. Next time we're in Madison in need of caffeine, this is the only place on the list. \n\nThey do however need to seriously consider cleaning or replacing their carpet"
4,"I stayed here during my past weekend in Vegas.  The place is not that bad. I got a great deal for it on vegas.com. 29 bucks a night! I read the really negative reviews but still took the risk and was glad I did.  The hotel itself is nothing fancy.  Our room was pretty clean when we first entered in it and parking wasn't as bad.  If you do come back at night, parking may take a little longer to find, but eventually you'll find a spot. The check in/ check out is easy and painless.  I would come back here again if they have great deals!"
4,"Stonecreek is a nice place to play, and the price is fair.  I do like the layout.  Fun but not gimmicky.  The scenery is nice, too.\n\nI will have to agree with others about the ball vacuum (aka creek) running right through the middle of the course.  \n\nThe staff also seemed nice enough when I was there.  I'm not sure what others were complaining about.  Overall, it's a decent place to play, and its location makes it ideal if you're meeting people from the other side of town."
4,"Great food, fast, friendly service, lots to eat and very reasonably priced. Hot and sour soup is spicy but not so hot that you can't taste the ingredients. The Family combination (for two @ $11.95/person) of soup, egg roll and crab puff appetizers, mildly seasoned broccoli chicken and spicy Mongolian beef plus rice was enough for two people plus leftovers to take home for tomorrow's lunch."
4,"This is probably the best all you can eat sushi in Las Vegas.  The rolls are made fresh to order, the menu has a great selection, and the service is fast.  The best things on the menu besides the rolls are the baked mussels and Ahi Poki.  Just those two I could eat forever.  I would have given this place 5 stars if I didn't have to wait so long for dinner.  But it was well worth the wait.  Sushi Mon needs to expand so they have more tables."
4,"stepped in for an ice cream, and i was happily surprised by the amazing quality. it was amazing.\n\nnice and quick service."
4,"Go for the drinking atmosphere, not the food!\n\nGreat neighborhood drinking spot. Big porch with many TV's and corn hole.  I don't think I've been inside with the exception of using the restroom.\n\nWednesday night Trivia at 8 pm is always a good time. Great beer specials (all draughts $3) and burgers are half priced, though, I don't think they are that great.\n\nParking is usually a pain, but you can get away with parking across the street.\n\nAgain, this is a fun place to grab a drink with friends, but I wouldn't expect a delicious meal."
4,"I used to come here a lot back in high school and I loved this place.  It's got great subs and - if I recall correctly - pretty good soup too.  The fries are some of the best I've ever had, plus you've got the option of the sweet potato fries which is a nice touch.\n\nAs I've gotten older and come here more infrequently (I've left Pittsburgh for school), I've thought about some things...Do they have vegetarian options? - I don't think so...What's up with the charge for a refill of the soft drinks?  Why is everything - the fries, the meat and even the bread greasy?  Yes, they don't take debit cards but there are two banks in each direction...so that's not a major issue.\n\nOverall, the place is decent...with some tasty subs.  You'll see a lot of high school and college students in here.  I'd prefer to give it more of a 3.5 star rating...but I'm working with what I've got."
4,"Since my daughters favorite food is sushi, this place has become a regular place for us. We've been coming here for a couple years now and love it. The staff is nice, and the food is good! The specials are almost always a welcome surprise! \nWe can always count on getting a quick bite no matter what time."
4,"If you enjoy walking around outside and shopping this is the place to do it. There are several clothing stores and specialty shops. Town Square also offers a movie theater, bars, lounges, and restaurants.\n\nIt is easily accessible from the expressway and from the Blvd. There is ample parking around the perimeter, if you can't find any metered parking inside the square.\n\nMost of my trips to Town Square are to Whole Foods. It is one of the largest Whole Foods in the area. I also make a trip down to Texas de Brasil every so often.\n\nIt is absolutely a great place to eat, drink, and shop. I definitely recommend taking a trip to Town Square."
4,"I was already in love with the food from Taco Y Taco, I didn't think it could get any better. With the addition if this new location, they proved me wrong. It's definitely better. Same great food, but add a bar and a snazzy interior, this location is a whole new experience. \n\nThe restaurant is the same set up as the original location. Ordering stations based on the type of meat you will be ordering. They have the same great salsa bar and menu items, so I'm excited. The al pastor is still my favorite but I have to branch out next time. Elote is also a must. \n\nIf only they would open a location on my side of town, but until then I will be making the drive to their Trop and Eastern locations in the time being."
4,"The arena is super convenient if you're staying in the hotel, but it's really cold, and the ushers don't let you go down to your seats during all parts of the game. You're supposed to wait until a \""pause.\"" It's not the theater, so I don't see why they're so strict about this. It's not like you're really going to disturb the nacho-munching spectators who are drunkenly yelling at the players. Seriously. Also, the lines for the bathroom and food were fairly packed."
4,"Great burgers, some of the best I've ever had with interesting combinations (I ordered the Rising Sun this time, and had a bite of my friend's Gold Standard).  The steak fries were perfect; fluffy inside and crunchy outside.  Great beer selection as well.\n\nThe value wasn't shabby for Vegas, where everything is overpriced.  The bill after tip for burgers and a round of beers was about $27 per person."
4,"I miss Katz's, I'm not going to lie.  The teeny tiny greasy spoon was a salve to what ailed you on a not-so-early Sunday morning. \n\nPostino, however, has lovingly converted the old building into something truly grand.  It's a DIY's paradise of interestingly applied building materials - no those red trusses aren't structural, but they're nice to look at, aren't they?\n\nYou will spend a little money here. Give them your business card, get on the mailing lists, make sure to show up for happy hour, and take advantage of nights with specials (Tuesday and Thursday seem to be popular down the Central corridor there).\n\nIf you have a group of more than 2, expect to wait a little while. But do, it's worth your time for the goat cheese and roasted red pepper bruschetta and a glass of bubbly. \n\nThe patio is lovely, despite being close to the parking lot. The valets are pleasant, please let them help you unless it's very late or very early in the day. People at Postino dress up a litte, there is a larger than average amount of eye candy, it speaks of affluence. So go ahead, wear your Sam Edelman keyhole peeptoes and order that big fat red wine with a hint of bologna in the flavor. You'll be glad you did."
4,"This place use to be called rainbow pho until one of the servers purchased the entire restaurant.\n\nPho Annie is a great place to grab pho or if your into the meat dishes like the grilled pork chops.\n\nThis is located on the west side for all you west side peepz!\n\nMy friend and I ordered the Chicken Pho and I ordered the grilled lamb chops with rice and egg. And for appetizers we had the fresh Vietnamese wraps.\n\nOur food was amazing, service was great, greeted with a smile and acknowledge you as a returning customer.\n\ncannot complain much about this place."
4,"I recently discovered this place and it is right around the corner from my office.  I love the jalapeno cilantro hummus.  What combination!  I don't love that they charge you for extra pita.  It feels like a bad commercial (remember the got milk commercials where the guy thinks he's in heaven and is stuffing his face with cookies only to find out there is no milk?) but I guess it's a jungle out there trying to get pita.  Maybe my expectation is too high and shouldn't assume you can have another piece of pita bread for your hummus.  At any rate, I've been here a few times now and would recommend the place.  They have a guava lemonade that really is refreshing and I have to give a least for stars for that.  They gyros are also great."
4,Pizza at this second location was very good.  Almost as good as downtown?  In a big shopping center so parking is easy.  Late Sat afternoon it was almost empty so no wait.
4,"We went to Steak 44 before going to a concert. It was a Wednesday night and the place was jammed. We were seated at a two top by the fireplace near the bar. We ordered the calamari to start. Nice big rings, not greasy. I had the filet which came out on the sizzling hot plate. Delicious. Hubby got the scallops. Also very good. We shared the baked creamed spinach which was really good. The baked potatoes..just ok. Sides are a little smaller than Mastro's but priced accordingly. Our server Matthew was excellent. We will be back!"
4,Wonderful  place to look for upscale pieces.  The staffs were caring  and I would recommend this  shop for buying and selling
4,"The atmosphere in Brass Monkey is better than any other pub I've been to in Edinburgh! I usually come here after a morning of classes or an exam and chill out in their 'secret' back room of mattresses and cushions.  Although sleeping is not allowed it's extremely tempting to just doze off with a pint.  The food is also great and I would definitely recommend their sandwiches which go well with the reasonably priced drinks.\nThe front room, however, has the brilliant atmosphere I was referring to.  It's small with very few tables and so isn't cluttered.  If you're in there early you can grab a table with your mates and settle down for a heavy session in the midst of the bustling environment which the pub offers.  The problem, however, is that if can't find anywhere to sit then you're forced to stand which is fine, but it can just feel a bit cramped and pointless.  \nBrass Monkey is a cosy and affordable alternative to the larger and more conventional pubs in Edinburgh.  Worth a visit no matter the occassion."
4,First time here was good and the food was great. the pho was done well and the broth was great as well the only reason for the 4 stars is the Customer service. they had a great attitude but i had to get up to ask for a check and a to go cup. It would have been better to order and pay up front and seat ourselves so we know that we have to get up to get to go cups and Drinks etc... because there was 1 person working the register and tending to everything so it takes away from the customer service of a sit down restaurant . but thats my opinion i will go back for sure and will tell others to go there.
4,"Great Breakfast spot... Suggest, the Lumberjack \nSolid consistent food. Definite improved alternative to going to Dennys or Ihop.. !!(haven't been to either one in a couple years now) \n\nWe flop between good egg and waffle house (yes, we get our greasy food on once in awhile)"
4,I don't think I would touch any other Thai in the west island. This place is fantastic. Everything tastes fresh and delicious. Beats most restaurants around here by a long shot.
4,"Ay, ay, ay!!!!\n\nThese tacos are for realz yo.  I'm from \""La Villita\"" in Chicago therefore I am a certified taco expert. These are legit. \n\nSuper fresh (made right in front of your face!), tasty and totally authentic. \nI wasn't expecting much because honestly, Vegas has not impressed me with its taco-ness. \n\nThey are a but pricey at $2 each but they are the best that Vegas has to offer. \n\nI tried the taco de tripitas (fried tripe) and a taco de carne adobada (think al pastor). \n\nDeliciously good and worth the wait to have these delicious morsels prepared fresh as you stand and drool behind the glass envisioning them entering your face."
4,"A great value for a clean car; this is a no frills place.\n\nThere's no  line of people waiting to clean, wax, and polish your car; as such, no one trying to up sell you a new wind shield or $100 detailing service. The employees simply ask what you would like and send you on through the wash. \n\n**Note, if you have an older vehicle with a metal antenna, be sure to detach it before entering the wash.**\n\nI used to get the $2 wash until I decided to step up to the $5 wash last week. I was plesantly surprised when I saw my wheels were clean when I bent down to wipe them off - this you don't get with the $2 wash. \n\nThey have free vacuum stations for all their customers. If your willing to spend a few extra min doing the vacuuming and wiping down your dash yourself, you get just as good of a wash or better than the full service car washes that you spend $20 on.\n\nTheres usually no (or a very short) line of people waiting to wash their car. In general, you're in and out within 15 - 20 minutes."
4,"Too bad the chips and salsa are so darn good because we filled up so badly we could hardly eat our meal. The food was still tasty, however: I had the chicken mole, DH had the chingalingas, and the kids each tried a mexican choice off the kids' meals. Our server, Sara, was awesome - she offered to switch out one of the kid's meals when he complained about it being too spicy. For the record, he ate it all and said it was delicious. \n\nWe've eaten there before and decided the best place to fully enjoy this restaurant's fabulous atmosphere is out on the patio so go when the weather is just warm enough to dine al fresco and when it isn't crowded with a private party."
4,"This was one of the quickest, most efficient airports I've ever been in. Most of the check in and security process is fairly automated and extremely streamlined. There was no line to check in, and security only took about 5 minutes. No hassle whatsoever. This gave us plenty of time to sit and eat a small breakfast before the flight. Passengers are also treated to two hours of free wifi in the terminal. Fantastic!"
4,"The food was delicious, tasty and fresh.  The servings are small, and a little pricey, but worth it.  Towards the end we felt like our waitress had forgotten about us.  Most of the meal the wait staff was attentive and each waiter that brought our food was knowledgeable.  We had the grilled scallops, fried squid, spicy tuna, glazed ribs and salmon nigiri.  The spicy tuna and glazed ribs (with lime juice) were the best.  Unfortunately, they made a big mistake and charged my card $366 instead of $149 for dinner.  I'd still go back because the food was delicious, but the billing mistake was a huge inconvenience."
4,So I enjoy places like this.  We went here for lunch and although it was slow we were not greeted at the door and pointed in any direction.  We kind of wandered around and checked out the selection for a minute before someone told us we could sit wherever we liked.  It was $9.99 for lunch which I thought was a little steep for a place like this but it was nice with big booths.  I made myself some broccoli chicken with onions and mushrooms and then used the recipe off the wall to make a mongolian sauce for my stir fry.   The weak point of this place is they don't have a lot of sauces.  I've been to some similar places that have a much better sauce selection.  The people were nice and the food was great though.
4,"WTF is a dueling piano bar?! Step in here and find out...but I can tell ya it's a strangely high amount of fun.\n\nHeading back to our rooms after a late-night meeting, we got dragged into this place by one of our amped-up coworkers (luvyaBrit!!!), and eventually ended up with our tushies in a big comfy seat around a table while we laughed ourselves silly at the dueling piano players.\n\nIf you are not into the whole seedy LV bar scene, check this place out as it's mellow yet fun and honestly the sing along and raunchy humor is right up my alley.\n\nNot so keen on....the cranky waitress who kept asking us if we wanted drinks....and eventually told us in a snotty ass voice that there is a 2 drink minimum per person, since that is why they don't charge admission.\n\nWell maybe tell us that when we sit down instead of just giving us attitude for 15 minutes? Not rocket science. Oh and you can order bottled water as a 'drink'...stay hydrated in Vegas right.\n\nLoved...the pleather snakeskin bluey green pants that the skinny chick dueling piano gal was wearing, and she rocked them too!"
4,"I haven't had a bad experience with Cox yet, so I'll just start with my install.\n\nThe techs were friendly, efficient, got everything done quickly and correctly, bade me farewell.\n\nI called for service on Thursday. Since I was new construction, they needed to send someone out to survey the development I was in to make sure I could get service. That happened the next day, my appointment was made for two days after that. Quick, easy, painless.\n\nI'm on the internet, my HDTV is hooked up, customer service has been fine, and I feel good about what I've got.\n\nNo complaints yet!"
4,"The produce selection and sandwich specials can't be beat, but sometimes the deli counter is a bit slow during the lunch rush."
4,"HAZE is the business!\n\nDon't partake without a table. This is rule of thumb for any club in Vegas, but especially true here at Haze as it is small and compact, size-wise.\n\nThe music here is SICK! Thursday nights are the best, it's industry night. If you're off on a Friday or in town on Thursday night, look no further than Haze.\n\nThe lights are amazing here and if you partake in other substances, you'll thoroughly appreciate the visuals provided to you here.\n\nThere are very talented go-go dancers/ models here. Their costumes are extravagant. \n\nHaze is like a mini rave and the PLUR vibes can be felt."
4,"First off all, this is not really an eat-in place. Know that your going for the food not the atmosphere.\n\nThey're serve easily the best pad thai in KW, they're portions are big and they're fast and inexpensive."
4,"An incredible gastronomic experience that are beyond any expletives, as the previous review said, that can be used to express the awesomeness of this place. A rustic quaint little cottage hidden in a small park that takes you literally as if you were out in the countryside. Our table was within arms reach and in full view of the two young chefs who were intensely prepping the meals. The servers were very friendly. The food was perfectly matched with the wine for each course. The meals were well-balanced. All the ingredients were procured from local sources and couldn't have been any fresher. Had a great time sharing the dinner with a friend here. There was some difficulty making our way out through the tiny door way which we didn't have any problems getting through earlier before the meals. ;-)  \n\nWhen in Edinburgh, a definite must!"
4,"Windsor is one of my favorite happy hour places. The drinks are great! I love the #89! So yummy! The foods good, too. Nothing super fancy, amazing kale salad."
4,"Another solid 4 stars for this place.  Yeah it is dead, but that's one of the things I like about it.  I love coming here and relaxing and listening to the off-beat jazz or satellite music they have.  It is so much different than the \""busy\"" atmosphere of Pin Kaow.  And way cheaper too.\n\nI also love the $5.00 lunch special!  I think a lot of the reviews who say it takes forever to eat are really, really hungry.  I'm in and out of here in 30-45 minutes.  \n\nCome and enjoy it!  All the curries and soups I've had here are really good!  Support Silverado Ranch businesses :)"
4,"Top notch coffee and espresso here with polite staff, and my goodness I sincerely hope this is the new norm of having draft beers at a coffee shop.  Amazing.  High marks for the aforementioned reasons.  However I just don't care for much of the customer base here, especially the younger kids who seem to occupy the limited table space for lengthy periods of time.  Rather have the mid career to older demographic at many restaurants in this area.  Parking can be challenging at times as well, but that's not surprising for the area."
4,"Nice place to shop for fresh produce and good food. One catch though you have to be your own cashier and bagger, then the light flashes when there is an error with the system, and you have to ask the attendant for help. You can sign up for their Fresh and Easy Card there, for extra discounts. Their new store will be opening on Fort Apache soon too !"
4,"I remember coming here when it was New York New York, the vibe is just as great. The patio makes 5801 perfect spot for late night drinks on a gorgeous summer night.\n\nThe bartenders are wonderful and so are the patrons. I have yet to make it out for bingo but it's definitely on my to do list!"
4,"This place is downright delicious.\n\nI was craving cheese steaks as soon as I came back from philly and this place came recommended as one of the best in las vegas.  It's the only cheese steak establishment I've ever seen in sin city so I thought I'd give it a try and I'm sure glad I did.\n\nIt's just a really good cheese steak.  That's all there is to it.  The bread is soft but not too soft.  The steak is cooked just like it would be in Philly and the toppings are plentiful and tasty.  There's also many different variations to choose from like the cheese, peppers, onions, and what kind of sauces you want on it.  I always go steak 'wit' provolone, peppers and onions.  Writing this review right now makes me want one.  I guess I'll have to settle for Philly's Best tonight, but that's another review."
4,I had a little trouble with the website but when I called the guy who answered was extremely helpful. Menu is hard to find on the website (it's above the brunch menu) but once you find it go get the Om burger. So delicious! I got it with the kale chips and it was a good decision. I can't wait to try more from Fern. Next time I will go and sit down because the atmosphere is awesome.
4,"Ive eaten here twice for dinner in the past year, and been very impressed with the food both times.  Apps, entrees and desserts were all delicious, and the wine list is above average.  I will say though, 5Church has somehow earned the reputation of \""a place to be seen in Charlotte,\"" and I think that attitude among the servers and other patrons may detract a bit from the restaurant overall.  The servers take the \""hipster\"" vibe just a bit too far, and I cannot find words to describe the outfits women wear to this place; honestly, it's ridiculous.  If you are looking for good food uptown, you will find it here.  Just be prepared to look past the \""We wish we were in Manhattan or LA\"" vibe from everyone else in the building."
4,"Ordered to go. Asked for cold veggies on the side. Did not dissappoint. Got our burgers home, thirty seconds in the microwave and it was as if they had just come off of the grill. Yum!\n\nGot the fries. Really tasty, but kind of frustrating. They are so thin. You have to grab four in order to get any ketchup to stick to them."
4,"The moment you walk in it smells amazing! I loved the MGM's signature smell. We stayed in the Grand Tower, our room was neat, clean, and looked great. The restroom was clean, and looked fairly new. Whatever you do, don't remove the drinks that are in the refrigerator, not even to take a picture because the fridge has a timer. Overall, it was a great experience, Jason checked us out, he was very pleasant and friendly."
4,"I'm new to Pittsburgh and wanted to try a really good rendition of pierogies. We ordered the classic potato and sauerkraut and the pizza pierogies at the suggestion of the owner, and also split a Reuben-like sandwich (forget the exact name). The pierogies were good and the sandwich was nice (good quality bread and meat). After talking to the owner as we were ordering, I really like the idea of what they're doing (high quality ingredients, making their own corned beef, etc.) I guess I just wish I was a little more blown away by the pierogies; they were good, but not as amazing as I was expecting."
4,Awesome little record store. I could easily spend an hour perusing their new and used selections. I could spend another hour (at least) exploring their various listening stations. I could then spend an additional half-hour finding little neon-colored stickers that tell of upcoming local shows.\n\nI agree with John V. Long live the record store!
4,"I was pleasantly surprised to find a wide selection of drinks at a good price here.  The strawberry banana was great but the milk tea was just not my cup of tea.  The service is fast and friendly, I got my drink in probably less than two minutes of ordering and the portions are good for the price.  \n\nIt's interesting the location of this place considering it's so far from Chinatown and in an area you wouldn't think of people liking boba.  I was even more astounded when about a group of 10 teens all crowded the place as I was leaving.\n\nI would say 5 stars for anyone in Vegas, but it falls short compared to some places in San Francisco, so 4 stars to me."
4,"Had a great dinner last night for restaurant week. Filet was great, the added lobster was a bit over done but still tasty. Service was terrific! Way to go Ruth Chris staff"
4,"Checked out Dexter's for a Friday fish fry and it was surprisingly awesome. Great atmosphere for a neighborhood bar. Unexpectedly diverse beer selection that's constantly rotating (had a great Lagunita's Hairy Eyeball). Fish was some of the best I've had in Madison. Ordered both the cod & walleye and both were delicious--thinly battered and fried perfectly without excess grease. Waffle & brew fries were delicious too. Amazingly, after over a thousand calories of deep fried food, I still didn't feel nasty. Thanks for helping me kinda stay catholic.\n\nSpecial mention to their outstanding service. After someone stole our place in line, they apologized profusely and hit us up with a free spinach & artichoke dip appetizer. Very sweet."
4,If the food is as good as the service then I'm gonna love this place. We sat at the high tables in the bar and Terry brought it!
4,"The Blue Parrot is a quirky little place in Stockbridge. The chicken and cashew chimichanga I had was extremely good, packed with mountains of succulent chicken. Their soup was tasty, also. Service wasn't quite what it could have been, and their cellar-conversion toilets will divide opinion, but it's well worth a visit.\n\nOverall, we said: \""I was impressed with the Blue Parrot. It served me two good dishes, in quirky surroundings...I'm not the world's biggest fan of Mexican food, not least because over the years I've eaten in some very ropey Mexican places around Edinburgh, but I'd happily head back here the next time I'm feeling the need.\"""
4,Great place for happy hour. Only four stars cuz the service is always hit or miss but the food has always been choice..
4,"Pinky's gets 4 stars from me because the food is decent, I love the atmosphere, and they have some pretty good vegan options. I don't believe they have the vegan options designated on the regular menu, but make sure to ask for the secret vegan menu. I had been to Pinky's several times before and then finally on one occasion my waiter realized I was ordering all vegan food so he brought this magical vegan menu from the kitchen that included tofu meals that aren't on the regular menu. The tofu concoction I had that day was delicious. Their chili is also amazing (and vegan) and has a good kick to it. This place gets packed right at noon so be prepared to wait in line. They have some good beers to choose from and I love their outdoor/indoor patio. Overall a solid place to hang out and grab a bite."
4,"Whoaa...meat in a sushi roll????  I had the 'Lamb-Burgushi' roll and it straight up blew my mind.   From now on, when a server asks me how I'd like my lamb prepared, I'm going to say 'rolled'.\n\nAside from the great menu, the server was cool and knew a lot about sushi and all the other concoctions they had to offer (including the drinks).\n\nOnly downside is the noise.  There's a lot of racket in this place."
4,"Fantastic Thai cuisine served to your spicy index every time. I have dined several times on layovers in PHX and have always walked out 100 percent satisfied, both with the food and the service provided by Pom and Austin. Do not miss the spicy flaming soup it is fantastic. In fact, i try a new dish every visit and the flavors and spice are always perfect. Just let Pom know what you like as far as fish, chicken or beef and let her order up you a meal worth a post on Facebook!!! Enjoy\n\nps..this is a 4/5 rating. i am saving the 5/5 rating for Mom when i visit Thailand myself"
4,"I debated on going here simply because it's such a touristy thing to do, but decided to go anyway.  I had a great time getting pictures and doing silly poses with most of the wax celebrities.  I went during the week so it wasn't that crowded...except the Michael Jackson figure had a line because each person was changing into Smooth Criminal costumes before taking their pictures.  Each wax figure pretty much looked like the celebrity.  Some capture the likeness so good that it's a bit freaky.  There are a few exhibits where staff try to tempt you into buying a copy of their picture.  It's pretty unnecessary if you have a camera or a decent cell phone camera.  \n\nThe only figure I was disappointed in was Cameron Diaz.  Hers seemed to make her look better than what I think she looks in person.  I think the Tupac figure had bullet wounds on his chest from when he was murdered; if true was a bit unnecessary considering there were no bullet wounds on JFK or Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nNOTE:  It's $30 per person to get in.  Pick up a coupon book at the Monorail for a $5 off coupon or catch one of those guys on the sidewalk offering 50% off coupons.  Or Google an offer online before you make the trip to Vegas.  I checked in on Yelp and didn't see a special offer, but seems like there are coupons everywhere, so there should be no reason to pay full price to get in."
4,"Came here yesterday evening while traveling for business.  I always do my homework on Yelp when on these trips to try and find local spots I might not always find by simply driving around.  I have to say I was not let down by the positive reviews.\n\nThe Emerald Curry was recommended to me as their best curry, and it really was a solid choice (and I have had a lot of curries).  They are not cheap on their portion size, and the service was friendly and prompt.  I love Thai curry, and seek it out wherever I go -- this curry was very nicely spiced (I like it pretty spicy) and it was loaded with vegetables, which makes me \""feel\"" like I'm eating healthier ;)\n\nI would definitely recommend, and will likely come back when I'm in town again -- it is good quality, reasonably priced, friendly service, and a nice, relaxed atmosphere right on the King Street strip."
4,"i'm between three and four stars for the red squirrel, but as it's one of the holyrood 9a bars i'll let it get the four stars.  why the debate?  well it's a bit difficult to review as i really only popped here to meet the boyfriend after work for a quick drink before heading on someplace else.  \n\nbeing right bang in the middle of lothian road and the financial district of edinburgh this bar was packed on a friday night!  which shows two things, either it's very popular with the business people or it's one of the few decent bars in the area.  i would tend to lean towards the latter as this place is fairly small compared to the other bars on lothian road.  however, it does have amazing burgers as i saw and smelled from the couple being served at the table behind me and they have an awesome selection of innis & gunn beers which is my preferred beer to drink.\n\nthe red squirrel definitely looks like a cool place and being branded with holyrood 9a i know the burgers will be delicious, but something about it's location isn't convincing me to rush back.  so yes, 4 stars i'm a fan because it's a good place to meet the boyfriend since he works across the street, but not such a fan because i prefer the atmosphere at the other 9a venues compared to this one."
4,"this restaurant sits on the strip side of the palazzo so since the weather was nice (85 and sunny) we sat on the patio.  like some have said, there are times when you don't want to sit outside but it was surprisingly comfortable for late may.  my parents live in vegas so i've seen the strip a thousand times, but the view from morel's onto the strip was just fantastic.  highly recommend sitting on the patio.\n\nthe service was good, and our waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable.  on his emphatic (too empathic perhaps?)recommendation we ordered the french onion soup and it was quite tasty, very flavorful.  my steak came out next and it was the right amount of bloody goodness, i pretty much tore through it.  kinda wish i ordered the mac n cheese though, apparently it's off the chain."
4,"This is the only place that I will buy Pad Thai. The Chicken Pad Thai is fantastic. I have tried it at several different places, even authentic thai places and some come close, but in my opinion, Pei Wei's is the best."
4,"Very good bagels with a hint of back east charm (small and a bit worn down).  Love the Sunflower bagels, not sure what makes it so tasty but Yum!!"
4,"I went here twice in one week.  Once for dinner, and once to the club quite a bit later.  For dinner, I would've rated this 3 stars. Nothing wrong with it, nice atmosphere, good service, decent food.  But that's it. The club, on the other hand, was great.\n\nWe were there on a Wednesday night, so most other clubs weren't exactly buzzing.  This place was.  It was busy, yet the servers were always there for you.  Drinks were good, I wasn't paying so of course they tasted extra good.\n\nI would definitely come here when in Vegas again.  For dinner though, I'd find another spot first.\n\nP.S. Don't wash your hands in one of those Roman style sinks in the hallway...I know they are already turned on for you, but you will not find paper towels to dry them off with...;)"
4,"The chefs here may not have attended Le Cordon Bleu but make no mistake: the food is tasty, cheap, and comes out quick. The best part about this place is its status as neighborhood landmark and its extremely amiable staff. You feel like a regular in this place the first time you walk through the door. If you want to resist the invasion of franchises like McDonalds, Subway, etc, spend your hard earned money here. support these guys!"
4,"A hidden gem!  \n\nWe never knew this place existed and stumbled into it after lunch at Chino Bandito (next door).  They have all sorts of flavors of popcorn and are more than willing to let you sample them. Even some seasonal flavors. We were really excited about the Cake Batter flavor but we sampled it in the store and were a little disappointed in the lack of cake batter flavoring, too much spoiling by Cold Stone's ice cream flavor I guess.  \n\nWe took advantage of the bakers dozen deal on the small snack size bags so we could try lots of flavors, it was 13 bags for $11 (normally $1 each).  They were even willing to make us a bag of a flavor if we didn't see it in the small size. \n\nThey have many more flavors than what's on their website, some of the ones we got were Churro, Bacon & Cheese, Cookies & Cr\u00e8me, Coconut, PB & Chocolate, Cherry Chocolate and Candy Bar.  \n\nThe store had lots of cute tins/gift ideas so next time you are trying to come up with a gift idea for someone, this might just be a great alternative option to the classic gift card."
4,"I wanted to see a black pig, but all they had was a pink one... Dx I still liked seeing the animals though :)"
4,"Came here on a Friday night, right after arriving in Vegas after a long drive.  Walked right up to the front of the line (just beat the crowd) and was able to order my custom pizza. The way this place works is pretty much you can create your own custom pizza from scratch with as many toppings as you like for one flat rate.  They also have multiple sauces you can choose from as well. The people behind the counter were all very nice and willing to help with any questions you had.\n\nNow to the pizza itself.  It tasted great! I ordered the the meat lovers one and added jalapenos.  It is all made on a very thin crust and comes out nice and crispy.  The crust was very tasty (I added a splash of garlic around the sides) and the toppings tasted fresh.  \n\nI would definitely recommend this place to friends and families that are looking for a good and easy pizza place."
4,Great customer service but I had to explain my order 3x. How hard is it to punch in a number 1 spicy with mac and cheese? They also came out to sweep the floor during my visit. I would normally praise them for being clean but the girl kept putting her backside near and once on my table. I would have appreciated it normally but she was didnt have the backside to pull that off LOL.\n\nThe biscuits had a honey glaze I don't remember from the 90s but was still pleasantly refreshing. \n\nThe spicy chicken had my nose running always a plus. The mac and cheese was great. Would have been nice to have a piece of corn on the cob but all in all a good experience
4,"As noted in previous reviews, Trader Joe's has a large variety of specialty, hard to find, and/or natural/organic items. I do enjoy walking the aisles to find new and interesting products. The specialty ravioli is one of my favorites as well as the all natural desserts. However, what other reviews failed to mention was the natural cleaning products. The main reason I stop at Trader Joe's is for the chlorine free paper products and natural cleaing products especially the laundry detergent. Chlorine free/recycled paper products seem to be hard to find in the stores. Giant Eagle Market District used to carry some Seventh Generation paper products but they haven't had any for well over a year. Before Trader Joe's, if I had to order all of my paper products online to be delivered. Now, I can find good quality, chlorine free, recycled paper towels, napkins and toilet paper for a great value at a local store. Their laundry detergent is also less expensive than the other name brands like Seventh Generation or Method but it works just as well. Yay Trader Joe's for helping me keep my family healthy and clean with less toxins!"
4,This restaurant is excellent. It isn't far from home. It has the New York style and it is mine and my hubby's favorite spot. The food is great and the staff superb!
4,The food was very good . The service was good too. I couldn't believe how cheap the beer was.  My boyfriend and i had some sort of German chilly fries which was really good.  We also had the giant pretzel.  So good.
4,"Love The Greene House. Especially the Sunday special with half off bottles of wine!\n\nThe fish + chips is to die for. So so good. \nAnd, just about every single appetizer on the menu is delicious!"
4,"I really with we had one close to us out here in Surprise! The prices are great! I stopped in to grab a healthy quick lunch for the hubby and I to have as a picnic :) whole grilled chicken, big (fresh and sweet) fruit salad, enormous beet/carrot/apple/celery juice and we were set under $20, more like $16!! At whole foods it would have been $30 easy.  I get it, they are a world apart, but all in all, healthy and way less money!"
4,"Love this mall...beautiful mall and great stores. Probably spent more then I wanted to, but couldn't restrain. :)\n\nNordstrom's is awesome.  What great service they offer."
4,"I know this isn't the best farmers market. I know it isn't deserve 5 stars. I know they need more local. I know it is weird to see bananas. I get all of that. BUT THIS PLACE IS SO EASY AND STILL CHEAPER THAN A GROCERY STORE. But, yay, it would rock if they stepped up the local produce section.\n\nThey have delicious local heirloom tomatoes. That are almost always fresh and perfect.\n\nTHE FLOWERS. There is a lady who sales the most beautiful fresh cut flowers. Bring extra cash and buy yourself, your girl, your mom some. Absolutely stunning flowers."
4,"I made an appointment with Dr. Tognacci on the recommendation of a friend.  Previously, I had terrible service with previous physicians and was extremely wary to try another.  I had a number of items I wanted to discuss and did not appreciate the \""revolving door\"" approach of other practices.  Dr. Tognacci did NOT take this approach.  He patiently discussed all my concerns and if he didn't know the answer off the top of his head, he did thorough research to competently answer my concerns.  I never felt like I was on the clock and when my time was up, he would rush out the door.  He was relaxed and listened to my concerns.  He treated me as an equal in the decision-making process.  And when I left, made sure that I had the needed prescriptions and plenty of samples.  I was extremely relieved to find a healthcare provider with this level of service.  Highly recommended!"
4,Minuscule petit restaurant de 20 places mais de la grande cuisine et superbe ex\u00e9cution. L'ambiance y est sobre et sans flafla et la musique un tout petit peu trop forte sans \u00eatre d\u00e9rangeante. L'entr\u00e9e de sashimi de boeuf au ponzu est brillante et la morue au miso absolument exquise. J'ai h\u00e2te d'y retourner pour essayer les plats principaux et les diff\u00e9rentes formules en tables d'h\u00f4tes.
4,"There will always be a place in my heart for The Orchard. As the first place we went to for a drink when we moved into the area five years ago, I've always made The Orchard one of our regular watering holes. The staff are friendly, the prices are reasonable, and although I've not sampled the food menu extensively, what I have had has been very tasty.\n\nWhat I really like about The Orchard is the atmosphere. There's a mix of regulars who tend to take up residence at the bar and will always offer a tale or two to those who wander in, looking for a place to satisfy their thirst. There's also a great mix of ages, which I find really refreshing as some bars seem to have an unspoken age policy, but that's not the case in The Orchard.\n\nI can't talk about the food in too much detail, but I have had the steak pie, which was delicious, and often my friends and I order chips whilst we work our way through our drinks. The chips are great, not thin and oily, but fat and fluffy.\n\nI will always champion The Orchard, especially on a hot day, when you can sit outside and watch the world go by."
4,"I like this little club. It appears to be a small club in a strip mall next to the Horse & Hound, but inside it is very spacious. The club brings in a good mix of local artists and larger known performers. I saw KRS-One here in 2009 and Slick Rick here yesterday. Security is smooth - I typically pre-purchase my tickets and have no trouble getting in the building quickly. Both times I have been the show was pushed back an hour, but once it started it was great. It gives the local acts a chance to get their name out there. \n\nYesterday I didn't purchase alcohol (I pre-limed elsewhere), but I bought an energy drink. Actually I bought two because there is a $10 limit on charge cards and the drink was $4. A couple of bartenders there to keep it moving. \n\nThe sound is good, but the thing I like most is that while it is overall very roomy, it is also a venue where you can get up close to the performers.  I would recommend seeing a show here. Most are about $20 and tickets are easily purchased online. They have a web site, but the videos and photos show they are not always updated. I think if they had an improved web site that included recent pics, videos and upcoming schedule, it would be great. There is a calendar of events, but it could be improved."
4,"Awesome selection of cigars in the humidor - all the major brands covered and it was nice and spacious.  The bartenders were great and quickly got paired whiskies to our table outside with a side of water!  Outside misters provide additional cooling, in the evening the sun is not direct so it's a nice cool atmosphere.  I was interested in the members only section of the club, but did not inquire - perhaps on my next visit!"
4,Great lunch menu. Food here is always good but the service can be kind of hit or miss. They had one waitress named Jamie that was probably responsible for drawing in half of their business.
4,"Very good burger & fries.  The meat is brought in fresh everyday, so I was told. Lady behind the counter sold me on a piece of peach pie. She said the fruit pies are made fresh daily. This place reminds me of an old school diner from back in the day. Think I will try the hash browns next visit. They looked really good and crisp."
4,"First timers, I took the family (wife and three girls) here and we LOVED it. Half-price happy hour appetizers (ribs, enamame and spring rolls) were great. Dinner was excellent as was the service. Got out for $100 + top! which is good value. After a week in Scotsdale, trust me, this is good value. Would def go back; great spot!,"
4,"We found Casa Don Juan by accident looking for hangover food/drinks off of the Vegas strip.  We got very lucky landing here!  The chips/salsa/beans that come to the table free are so good, so was the bloody Mary and the pineapple pina colada.  \n\nIt has great outdoor seating which we sat at to enjoy the sun, inside the restaurant was pretty cold at the time.  My sister had the chicken fajitas and the portion size was huge, and she loved them.  I had a platter with pork tamales YUM! a beef taco that was ok and a fried pablano pepper stuffed with cheese also very good.  We ate everything and it did help cure the hangover.  Definitely tasted like authentic Mexican you can only get on the West coast."
4,Loved the place! If your a little group it's awesome to have your own lounge especially for a friends birthday! The bottles of alcohol weren't that expensive. The fact that its intimate gives the chance for everyone to sing and not be shy! I am definitely going to go back.
4,"I've never had a bad meal at any of the locations/states I've eaten at.\n\nI don't drink beer but I enjoy the food. \nI most always order the same thing \""Mac and Cheese\"" no chicken, it comes with a decent house salad for only $7.99 (see pics) \n\nYou can't go wrong with this and two people could easily share this meal, it's alot!\n\nThey have some pretty good sandwiches like the \""Brewers Club\"" (see pics)\n\nI've also had their Chicken Fried chicken with white cheddar mashed potatoes.\n\nDecent Food and relaxed environment make this place easy to enjoy.\n3.5 stars"
4,The ckn was very tasty and fresh. Great value for $17 whole ckn with 2 large sides. Large space with friendly service.
4,"I would just like to add the last I visited I purchased the garlic parmesan  wings and they were delicious. The grease was fresh and they weren't all dark loved. I also have to say thanks to the management I'm sure if they read my review but the celery was not in the same container as the wings, I so thank them for it."
4,"More noodles than you can comprehend, Pho bouillon, Sriracha bottles bigger than your head, odd canned drinks to the tune of \""Sac Sac\"" with flavors ranging from ginger to \""spongy grass juice,\"" gummy candies, waving cat statues, vibrantly colored toys, and a brilliant butchery. \n\nParking can suck, but just find a spot around either side of the building.\n\nVeg section seems to be lacking a bit more than usual these days, but not a huge deal. Still love coming here. \n\nAlso, if you're planning on stopping in for a quick bite or preserved duck eggs, make sure you have at least $10 worth of goodies to meet their minimum for running a credit/debit card."
4,"This was the last night of my six day birthday celebration!  I could not have been more happy to spend an evening here with such good friends!  We couldn't have asked for a better venue and the food was soooo good!  Two of my four dining companians had the sausage and peppers and both of them raved about it.  They both like some heat so I assume there was heat for the taking.\n\nThe other two of us  of ordered Chicken Marsala and Chicken Piccata.  I know we both scraped our plates clean!!  Plus the bread is so good!\n\nThe wait staff was really good too.  And they took about 8 pictures of us to get one that we all looked good in.  \n\nThe music started at about 8:15  That's when the great people watching starts, which I love.   \n\nWhat can I say?  The food us really 4 stars.- the waitstaff it incredible and  if you dance or not - it's fun to stay for the dance-floor show!!"
4,"Good sandwich, surly lady taking our money...... Actually applied fresh lipstick before serving us. \nCan't take anything away from the sandwiches and the rest of the staff though."
4,"I had the veggie mushroom soup, which they served with a fresh pretzel roll. It was soooo yummy . However if you are going there for lunch, call your order in as they are extremely busy. You may be late punching back in from lunch, like I was. I waited 20 minutes for soup that was already cooked! Other than the wait time, I was pleased with what ordered except the jelly & PB brioche. I would have bathed in the soup if given that opportunity."
4,"Awesome place for breakfast!   We got there around 9:00am and it was busy but they sat us immediarely.  I had the veggie omlette with home fries, delicious and huge.   If you're into Bloody Mary's, try theirs.   Its only $9, it's made fresh and it was really good."
4,Nice lobby with beautiful mosaics in the floor. They definitely spent some serious cash! Awesome light show at night on the huge waterfall (you have to be seated at the bar or the SW Steakhouse restaurant to see it). The employees were all friendly and accommodating. \n\nThe location can be a positive or negative. It is not on the main drag area of the strip (it will take at least 20-30 minutes to walk to where all the action is).
4,"What??? There's been a Krispy Kreme Donut Shop at Dobson and Main for two weeks and I didn't know about it?? I immediately canceled my errand on University and pulled into the Safeway parking lot. I've been craving a cream filled donut for weeks! But I thought the closest one was at Superstition Springs and I hadn't gotten out that far this trip. Okay, now to enjoy...."
4,"Visiting the new Fiesta Mall In N Out Burger in Mesa a few times and despising the food, especially the soggy nasty fries, I tried this one in AJ to give it a chance. It was lunch time and just packed as these places get. Oddly enough with inside packed, line outside the door and people eating outside, we got in the long drive through line and I don't think we spent too much longer than five minutes. The fries were awesome and crispy and FRESH and a pretty good burger and nice fattening chocolate shake. Great, fast service and the food was GOOD! I think I'll go back some day!"
4,"Network has been my go-to place for alignments for several years now.  I am generally pleased with the work that they do, and I feel their prices are fair. Customer service varies, as there has been a different person at the counter everytime I've been there. Good, honest shop; I'll be back in the future."
4,Yummy toasted sandwiches. Had turkey and chedder on whole wheat. They were out of the broccoli cheddar soup which I was super bummed about. Maybe next time. The great thing is they deliver! I live right in the neighborhood so its nice for a change.
4,"Not being a popcorn connoisseur I can't say I know what truly constitutes good popcorn and great popcorn. However, Popped has some darn good caramel corn. The place is priced appropriately and they have a crazy variety of flavors. I've had them on a few different occasions and try to select a new flavor every time. What I like is that you don't have to eat all of it at once, the popcorn stays pretty fresh as long as you keep it sealed. \n\nI'll definitely be back for more - because as you know, once you Pop, you can't stop."
4,"This place was priced very well.  I would rate the massage average, as the pressure was not deep pressure as requested, but it was very relaxing and I felt good afterwards.  Therapists were very friendly and the ambience was great.  They used some great aromatherapy techniques."
4,"The staff's customer service skills need some work (i.e. say hello to people when they walk in, thank them for their order, etc..).  The food on the other hand was very good.  I ordered the #2 combo (Philly Steak, fries and soda for $7.99).  The sandwich was the perfect size for lunch and VERY tasty.  They use steak fries which I'm not a huge fan of, but that's far from a deal-breaker for me.  However, I would like to have seen another handful of fries.  The portion of fries they give you just doesn't coincide with the sandwich.  Overall it was very good and since they're right across the street from work I'm sure I'll be back!"
4,"What a cool concept! Not ice cream, not a slush, but more of a snow....or snoh. Choose your flavored snow, a topping, and a glaze (which is essentially a drizzle) on top. The menu isn't overwhelming with too many choices, which can be intimidating when you're trying something new. What they do have though, is really interesting. Taro flavored ice, mogi toppings, condensed milk glaze......it's very creative. \nThe place was very clean and decorated in contemporary IKEA style. I happen to love IKEA which is why I recognized the decor! \nSo what's the verdict? It's really refreshing and tasty. A very unique spin on a frozen treat. My only gripe is that the toppings and glaze were very light-handed, almost non existant. I just barely got to taste the tiny almond cookie crumbs and condensed milk on the top of my strawberry snow."
4,"I had a good time here last night. I didn't like having to shell out 10 bucks for cover, but my buddy was showing some art, and I wanted to see it. This place was packed with an eclectic crowd. It was good to see hippy chicks on acid mingling with jaw clenching metal heads, and e-tard ravers. Seriously..everyone was on drugs here. Even the bartender was spigacked out of her mind. Drinks were reasonable, so that made up for the cover charge. Met some nice people. Heard some good beats inside. Laughed at the band outside covering War Pigs (not because it was bad, I just didn't expect it.)"
4,"They did a great redesign of the inside. This used to be Native New Yorker quite a while ago and couple of places in between. Definitely worth the time to find. \n\nThe breakfast selection is limited but that might be along of the lines of they don't do a lot but what they do, they do very well. \n\nWe tried the Stuffed French Toast, Chaquillias and the Eggs Tuscano. I have to say everything was very, very good. The flavors are great and the prices were fair at $7 a plate. Good size portions too.\n\nMy only suggestion/complaint is the hostess needs to be much more aware and welcome people as they come in. Lots of attention needed there. \n\nService was good and the waitress was very friendly. It was busy so food did take a while but worth the wait. \n\nIt is near Sun City West so it was definitely an older crowd. \n\nWe will be back to try the lunch and dinner menu and most definitely return for breakfast."
4,We really like the atmosphere here! My Hangover Hash was top notch but my wife's spicy tofu tacos were extremely bland and she didn't eat half of it. The service was top notch as well! FYI their fries are awesome!
4,I'd say it's a pretty good place for a grec buffet.\n\nYou can have variety choices. Ambience is quiet nice. They offer private bar drink. I went to this place with my friends few times. Most of their foods are good and tasty. ( I like a lot their ice cream ). The best is they have halal meat for my muslin friends. They can enjoy with us too.\n\nFew foods are not likely we'll done or too salty. \n\nVariety price d\u00e9pend on date.
4,After reading all posted reviews can't wait to try this place out.  I am a very picky eater so stand by for my review after a taste the food from Pita Kitchen Grill.
4,"A nice little hidden away place in Gilbert\n Gf and I went there for breakfast and it was surprisingly good. I had the pancakes and meat ( sausage) and the gf had breakfast tacos (eggs, vegs, and ham). It was all good and the best part was apple fritters....it has a sugary cover to it and the inside is very soft. \nThis place gets packed so be ready to wait. Price range is moderate for what you get. Also....watch out for el scorpio....sting is muchos owie."
4,"Great food. Has a local feel, not quite dive-y but pleasantly local. Not unexpected based on the location. Went for the Bell's tap take-over for Mad-Craft-Beer-Week. Wife and I had the fish, right tastee."
4,"I came for the Day of the Dead festival this weekend, which is kind of a bust in itself; however, I enjoyed the museum. I checked out the Cotton Fields to Skyscrapers exhibit, and I thought it was really interesting. It traces the changes that have taken place in Charlotte and the towns/counties around us since the Civil War, and the whole thing was pretty wild. I am kind of a history geek, and I really like the interactive approach. The exhibit is pretty large, so you get a real feel for the eras that they're trying to recreate. \n\nThe Day of the Dead exhibit was kind of lame. I got there after they'd run out of sugar skulls, and there were no fancy dancers and only a few altars. I really like that holiday, so I'd hoped for more...however, I did enjoy the free museum admission, so I guess it worked out."
4,"Victor Hugo is a great little Continental Deli on the edge of the Meadows in Edinburgh.  It is in an ideal location to catch all the University students on their walk to and from classes and is a great place to go to in the summer as it is just across from the Meadows.  \n\nVictor Hugo has an excellent selection of freshly made bread and serves sandwiches and cakes make fresh every day.  They have a counter full of all different types of meats and cheeses which are very tempting.  My absolute favourite is their chocolate brownie which is very more-ish and I frequently pop in for breakfast in the mornings and have the fresh fruit salad.  Everything is organic and freshly made, and although everything tastes delicious, it is a wee bit pricey.   Victor Hugo now sell hampers so you can choose which foods you want in it and they will make it up and deliver it to you.\n\nThere is seating inside the shop, and it also has tables and chairs outside so it is a lovely place to sit and watch all the action from the Meadows on a warm day."
4,"As a resident of Matthews, my heart will always belong to the Royal Cafe and Creperie, but Hazelnuts does offer some pretty tasty crepes.  Hazelnuts is located right in the heart of uptown Charlotte... pretty hard to get to unless you work downtown and walk, but there are some side-street parking options (better brush up the parallel parking skillz!).\n\nThe place itself is in a lobby of a building so there are people passing through all the time, the main place hints at a clean, modern design - white walls and bold blackboards, with wood accents.  Their menu offers breakfast, savory, and dessert crepes... but I am sure you can customize you crepe if you ask them to.\n\nFriendly staff takes your order and in about 5-10 min depending on how long the line is, you will be presented with your own little treat for the day.  So far I've tried the Maple Dream for breakfast, which is the best of both savory (eggs and bacon inside) and sweet (maple syrup on the outside).  And I've tried the Basil Pesto Chicken for lunch.\n\nGreat breakfast or lunch option if you find yourself downtown.  No frills here, served on paper plates and plastic silverware, but the crepes still shine (its the food that is important right?)."
4,"This is really a 3.5 but I rounded up because the staff is so friendly. Its hard to stay in a penthouse suite at the bellagio and then staying at any other penthouse suite and not let that influence my review. \n\nWe stayed in the penthouse suite, it was about half the size of the bellagio's. Yes, I realize that the Vdara is about half the price of the Bellagio, but I digress. \n\nThe hotel is new and clean. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The room is clean and modern. I love the fact that they have a full sized refrigerator for booze and left overs. The bed is relatively comfortable, the windows are really dirty. \n\nOverall, its really good for the price. If you are looking for a luxury hotel, stick with Bellagio or Wynn. I probably wouldn't stay again."
4,"This course owns me.  That said, it's a great muni course--best I've played.\n\nCourse is challenging and will more likely reward the accurate player as opposed to someone who likes to slice their drives all over the place.  There are many holes that offer great views.  I liked the one on the back 9 where you hit basically through an opening in a forest and down three stories onto the green that's about 200 yds away.\n\nWill definitely be coming back again to this well-maintained challenging course.\n\ndmo out."
4,"When I think of Madison I think of this place. The beer is great, the food is diverse and extremely we'll made and the building is beautiful. I've heard raves about the African peanut soup(or whatever) but I opted for the brats and cheese curds."
4,"I have always wanted to go in here and check it out, at various locations, but never did.  Today I passed by here and decided this was a good time to do so.  It was right there and I had the time.  The store was nice and cool (important when it's 111 outside).  The clerks were super nice.  They left me alone when I wanted to just browse but were right there when I had a question or request.  I ended up buying one cute black cotton top with lavender sequined roses on the front and got it for 20% off by filling out an app for a credit card.  The manager even said if I came back within a week I could buy the other one I was looking at for the discount as well.  It's obvious they put customer service as a priority, not becasue of the discount, but because of the overall way I was treated the whole time I was in the store.  I will try to stop by here on future visits to town even though I'm not a big clothes shopper."
4,What a neat place to go. Lots of fun. Went there with family and friends and we had a great time. Food wasn't anything to rave over but it's not really an upscale kind of place. We had a great time and we will be going back soon.
4,"The food here is fresh and delicious, I never thought I would enjoy a veggie sandwich so much.  The trout sandwich I had here was also pretty good, and the soups and bakery items looked and smelled incredible.\n\nThe worst thing about this place is how incredibly busy it is.  It's always packed, with people waiting outside on the street since it's pretty tiny.  They also have a weird semi-table-service method where you get seated, but then order at the counter with a ticket, then a server comes out to deliver the food (eventually).  Then, you get up and pay the cashier.  I guess they don't want to shout out order numbers.\n\nAs a lunch option, it's one of the best light meals in the Old Town.  I personally liked Le Cartet better, but this place is good."
4,"First pho experience. It was better than average. The 3.5 average is spot on. \n\nMy friends and I ordered three different bowls and we enjoyed them all. I had the vegan pho which was super flavorful and full of veggies and noodles. I also ordered the tofu nuggets because I wanted to be able to say that I ordered tofu nuggets with a straight face. They were actually pretty good, as was the sauce they came with. My friend ordered crab rangoon. It was the same old crab rangoon you get anywhere, but they charged $8 for it. Seriously?\n\nThe service was very hurried, and the waiter never actually took a drink order. He just brought us all water and that was that; we hadn't even realized until he left with the food order. Hurried service also meant the food came quickly, and you can't complain about that. No asking for dessert either. The check just came when he decided to bring it. So it goes.\n\nAlso, for some reason that we couldn't figure out, there was house music playing in the background the whole time. It wasn't annoying. Just confusing. We just chalked it up to being Vegas after midnight."
4,"I'm in love with the place. Granted, I have only been here for breakfast... but hey, it is the most important meal of the day, right? Everything I've tried at Pesto Prima has been my favorite. The Prima Breakfast Sandwich is a mouthful of heaven. This sandwich is full of flavor that all really compliment each other well. It's also a pretty good size; I often get full off of one half. The Chai Tea is to die for. They make their own chai and it is by far the best I've had in town. Also, full of flavor and simply delicious. During my last visit I tried their Java Mocha Blast. It's a protein smoothie full of  magic... delicious. The only complaint I have about this place is that it's closed on Sundays. I hope to eventually try their lunch menu."
4,"One of the few places in Pittsburgh with authentic latino drinks! For that crowded from wall-to-wall experience, hit them up on a weekend night. I enjoyed the tacos by day, and the fact that they actually make REAL caiprinha's here, even when it's snowing outside. Now that's an oxymoron that I love: caiprinha's in the snow..... Only in Pittsburgh!"
4,"Friendly service, great food, neat atmosphere.  I like the heat and they don't disappoint.  This one will be a regular stop."
4,"St. Francis wins best french fries in all of Phoenix, hands down.  Their sister restaurant at the Downtown Public Market seems to have the recipe, but can't quite match up.  St. Francis remains a favorite brunch spot (great live music starts at 10:30am Sundays), and performs just as well for dinner.  The service is always on par and the food is consistently delicious.  Go for their breakfast sandwich, sans mayo-sauce (come on, quit being fancy - no matter what you call it, may doesn't belong on a breakfast sandwich).  Their flat bread pizzas and burgers are always a good call at dinner time.  Did I mention happy hour?  The bar scene here is small, but if you can grab one of the outdoor stools, you'll be happy for quite some time."
4,Similar to feativals in other parts of the country but better weather. Purchasing directly from artist or artisan gives more meaning. Some artists look like their work.
4,"The last few times I've been they just seem nicer and more attentive so I'll give a bump on a improvement. \n\nI noticed they started giving people hot tea as they walk in. Even when I came in for a to-go order of chicken, they brought me out tea.  When it was almost empty they dropped down another glass. I noticed it's been cleaner the past year than the first few times I dropped in a few years back. I appreciate the little things and wanted to note on improvements. \n\nI liked the chicken porridge ($6.95) a lot and it was piping hot when I got home. They must've freshly boiled the chicken because it took a while and the chicken was soft and fresh tasting. I like that ginger is plentiful but thinly shaved into the porridge and that they put green onion, cilantro and shallot crisp. I think this will be a spot I'll come for it again. It's a perfect for when I'm not feeling well. \n\nI think this has slowly won me over as my favorite late night soup place."
4,"We love this place. \n\nIf you go for an early dinner it is good for kids (high chairs there). \n\nTheir food is great, service is fast and staff is nice and is really a hidden gem.  \n\nLove their green curry (more rice would be nice though) and their sampler app is the best thing to get (YUM!)"
4,"I really like this cute little nail shop because it is not your typical chop shop. It's clean and relaxing. I have never had artificial nails of any kind but due to recent issues with my nails breaking so easily I decided to give them a try. The young lady suggested I go with gel tips which would last 2 weeks. Unfortunately, they started peeling off only 6 days later. I went back and she fixed them using a hard gel- no questions asked.  She did a great job of making my nails look natural and elegant."
4,"I was lucky enough to eat at the Cracked truck in the Food truck Oasis at bonnaroo.\n\n There are few things I like more in this world than a perfectly cooked egg and I know I'm gonna love a truck that makes this humble food their star ingredient. I did what I had to do and ordered the Goy Vey (bacon, hard salami, hash brown and a fried egg with sweet and spicy cream cheese on a ciabatta roll). This was glorious and for sure the best breakfast-for-dinner I've had in a long time. The sweet and spicy cream cheese made this not your regular run of the mill breakfast sandwich. The only downfall was the hash brown was fairly thin and hard to discern amongst all that fluffy bread."
4,"I felt like I was on the set of a softcore porn video. Two girls dancing behind these screens under blue and red light. Nice atmosphere for a lounge bar. A bit crowded, but a good crowd nevertheless. Certainly not a place to stare, but chill to hang out with the boys before heading out for the night. Drinks are bit expensive...redbull + vodka was like $18. ouch."
4,"Fuck the continental breakfast.  Get the creamy, slightly tangy eggs benedict on a flaky, butterfly, slightly doughy in the center croissant.  \nCoffee was so good I didn't have to put any creamer or sweetener. Service was excellent 'cause it's Vegas baby~\nLovely upscale decor with sumptuous fabrics, perfect setting for 3 girls to get together the morning after for some post-barhopping, post-coital, post-drama commentaries."
4,"The problem with subs is 6in isn't enough but 12in is too much...ha!\n \nAnyway, 7.5 is perfect and a 15in sub split just makes sense which is what Cousins has :)\n\nThe subs are yummy, the service is superb. The owner is SO nice, remembers you from last time and is concerned about your food/order. \n\nWe love coming here to support this small business owner and his yummy food."
4,"Really nice attendant. She was such a doll. Bonus - They don't charge to try on wigs! Found two great wigs for under $70 (total charge). \n\nLots of trashy looking isles in here, but it's a beauty supply store ;) -1 star for the awkward lines at the front desk."
4,"This place can't be beat in the downtown area in terms of creative, yummy food, relaxed atmosphere, and fair prices.\n\nI've sampled about half of the menu, and while the red curried noodles and veggies wasn't really spicy enough for me, I've otherwise thoroughly enjoyed everything!  The gypsy stew is probably what comfort food tastes like in heaven."
4,"Hidden vegan item bursting with flavor that even the most zealous carnivore could endure: Whole Grain Tuscan Linguine sans cream topped with tofu. Giggity. \n\nIf you've not had the pleasure of sinking your chompers into their Ride Krispy Treat, you're not living life to the fullest. I'm convinced the generous wedge of ooey gooey marshmallowy goodness is straight out of an angelic bake sale recipe book. I don't want the secret - I just want them to never stop - ever."
4,"Came here for a girls' evening last Friday.  I'm not so much a fan of the forced \""complimentary valet\"" but the city of Phoenix is grooming me to expect such things if I want to eat in the area.  \n\nThe restaurant is cute.  Menu is diverse and they have a great cocktail list.  The goat cheese appetizer is pretty fantastic if you like goat cheese.  The food is good, but not great.  I had the vegetable flatbread pizza and with a little more seasoning, it would have been delicious.  Our table shared the cheesecake in a jar as well as the stout cake - all were delicious (and I'm a tough customer when it comes to chocolate cake).  \n\nOur waitress was generally fantastic all evening.  She seemed a little short when there was a mix-up with the credit cards and amounts but was back to being cheery as soon as it was fixed.  I will definitely return!"
4,"This review is for the Boba: This Boba tastes excellent and is the best that I have had in this town so far, it does not taste powdered or overcooked. The service is friendly and I didn't feel unwanted being white"
4,"I picked up a salad here while I was visiting a friend in the area and I was very impressed! I love a good salad with fish on top. I'm used to most quick places (like Panera) using pre-cooked, cold salmon. It was a very nice surprise that they grill the salmon to order. I wasn't expecting to wait for fish but it was more than worth it!\n\nI took my salad to go but I couldn't help but notice they had beer and wine and, of course, a patio!"
4,"Good music, good pizza, good service. I really enjoyed eating here during my last visit  to the Phoenix area. We went in the evening on a weekday, so the restaurant was more on the empty side. We decided to sit outside to take in the warm evening. It was nice having good background music--it was eclectic and fun, and wasn't too loud or too quiet. And despite coming near closing, the service was fantastic. Our server was extremely attentive and funny. The food was excellent. We ordered a house salad to split and a large pizza with mushrooms, sausage, and peppers. The salad was really yummy--great dressing and  flavorful greens (not just a bunch of bland iceberg lettuce). The pizza had a very thin crust and high quality toppings. Our only complaint was as you got towards the center of the pizza, the crust got soggier and soggier. Would have liked it to be cooked just a hair longer. Other than that, we had a great time at Grimaldi's. Would definitely recommend if you're in the area!"
4,"We loved everything except for 1 thing..\nAMAZING kalbi ribs, rock & roll, aria, coco shrimp, avocado bomb. Order it all!\nDidn't like the red rock. Weird consistency and lacked something. Just doesn't work. \n\nAlso our avocado bomb barely had avocado unlike the previous pics posted.  We were kinda bummed about that."
4,First visit and I got to say I'm a bit underwhelmed.  I think it's partial to the bothersome stare I got when ordering or maybe it was the lack of beer I really like.  It's apparent that people really dig this place because of it's popularity but I guess I'll just have to go against the grain a bit here.\n\nI think the place has potential to be great and amongst brewery's locally I'd say this is probably the best in terms of beer selection and decent seating.  Other than that I'm not that impressed.\n\nI'm still posting 4 stars just based on my priority ranking of other brew houses in the area.
4,"I spent my honeyroom at the Flamingo and was very pleased, but not at first.  We checked in and were greeted by a very pleasant yet professional front desk clerk.  He gave us our key and off we went to check out our room....it was on the 4th floor and I about screamed when I opened the curtain and got a view of the air unit!  So I called guest services ASAP and we were transfer to the 18th floor GO room at no extra charge!  This was more like it...nice comfortable beds, views of the pool, and the over all feel of the room was much more pleasant, the flat screen was a nice touch.  I also enjoyed showering and watching tv in the bathroom.  :)  I would stay here again, the price was right and the location can't be beat."
4,They took part of France and plopped it in the middle of Vegas..including the very blue sky with wispy clouds that almost seemed to move as you made your way through streets of Paris. Lots of shops and typical mall prices.
4,"Absolutely fabulous. Had the chicken satay, dried beef, and pad cashew nut. I couldn't get enough of it all, so delicious! The staff is super friendly and sweet. Only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is we tried to order delivery a bit late and were told we could from the restaurant and to call a different delivery number, but the delivery number said they were not open. A bit complicated with no result!"
4,"Date night!  And where shall we go?  Cajun Queen of course.  This restaurant is located in a beautiful, old house on 7th Street.  Initially, we were seated in the very bright back room.  There also happened to be a ladies' holiday party, and, you know how we gals get when we are having fun.  Very loud.  \nSo, we asked to be moved.  We were told that there were no available tables in the other two dining rooms, but there was space on the rooftop patio.  Huh?  We didn't even know such a space existed.  It was an unseasonably warm December night, so here we go, upstairs to absolute delight!\nThe rooftop featured retro Christmas music, holiday lighting and a most splendiferous view.  We ordered a half order of the fried oysters to start.  They arrived crispy, with creamy Ranch dressing.  For our entrees, we both ordered the \u00e9touff\u00e9e, his with crawfish, mine with vegetables.  Both needed a little salt, pepper and hot sauce, but, after a little doctoring up,  they were good.  As an aside, I have had their vegetable \u00e9touff\u00e9e when it needed no adornment.  Awesome stuff.  \nAnd now, we shall request the rooftop each time.  Weather permitting."
4,"LOVE the Old Sugar Distillery for drinks. I love the horchata, or really anything with their honey liqueur. You can also buy bottles of their liqueur, which goes great with anything at home. I feel like it's sort of an underground spot, because most of my friends haven't heard of it, but I have one friend who swears by it. Unfortunately, they close at 10pm (which he says is the best part......how??), so you can't really plan to spend the night here. Though, it is close to some other cool/less-crowded bars, like the Brass Ring.\n\nI don't love how dark it is here, even though it's just one block off Washington... sometimes I walk fast from my car if I'm coming alone."
4,"It's clean, there are always machines available, different size loads, dryer is 7.5 mins. per quarter and you can choose the heat setting, detergent, softener and dryer sheets are sold for .75 cents, on site attendant, tv.  Also there is a 7eleven next door."
4,"Went on a Saturday morning, and it was packed...that was a good sign!  Although it was packed, we only had to wait 10 mins for the 3 of us.  I had the Eggs Maximilian with chorizo...wow...what a huge meal for $10.  I was pretty well nourished for the remainder of the day.  Full of flavor since it had everything but the kitchen sink in it.\n\nService was fast and friendly...drinks never got below 1/2.\n\nWill definitely be back!!!"
4,"My default hotel when in Vegas....\n\nIts right in the middle of the strip, and the beds are super comfy. \nIts also a bit cheaper than some of its neighbors, and much nicer than any of its cheaper neighbors. \n\nI got upgraded last time I was here, and about two weeks after we checked out, I got a phone call asking if I left keys in the room, which I thought were already lost forever. You guys are awesome! \n\nThey even shipped them to me without asking for a dime!\n\nSee ya for New Years!"
4,"I spent the majority of my weekend here for the NASCAR races. \nNow this review is extremely biased... \nI was treated to suite parking, which is as close as you can get. \nI watched the races from the suites, including food and drinks. \nI received passes to the Octane suite, which is a 5 star restaurant and bar at the track, by invitation only. \nSo, yes, I really like this place!! \nThe grounds were kept as clean as possible considering the amount of people in attendance. The PIR staff were very friendly and helpful. \nA few of the security guards were a little blurry about where some things were, but friendly all the same. \nIt is amazing how many people camp at the track for the weekend. \nNext time I'm going to watch the shopping cart races in the \""town\"". \nThis was my virgin voyage to a NASCAR event and I must say I was pleasantly surprised and would gladly go again..."
4,"Not being a really big cigar guy, I do however enjoy one with a stiff drink every now and again.  I had the chance to try this place out and I have to say I was instantly impressed.  \n\nI think it was the decor really that did me in.  Leather chairs, sofas and love seats.  Comfortable bar stools and warm wood accents and tables.  Perfect interior for a nice relaxing time.  \n\nIn terms of food, drinks and cigars I would rank it as acceptable.  I wasn't really there long enough for food so I'll have to chime in on that at another time I suppose.  I do hope to come back some time soon."
4,"I came to Siamese Kitchen with 19 other Yelpers and we plowed through much of the menu and overwhelmed the kitchen but they were gracious and didn't mind when I jumped in to help clear tables and keep the food moving.\n\nWow, that was a run-on sentence.\n\nOverall the food was really good and the service was good as well.  They did have a hard time keeping up (as most restaurants would when 20 people order at once) but were good natured about some of us jumping in now and then to bus tables or refill water.\n\nI really enjoyed the Yellow curry although I would order it hotter next time.  Dottsy ordered her pad thai hot and the leftovers came home with me...too hot for most.\n\nAll of the dishes I tried (7-8) were nice and flavorful.\n\nI will keep Siamese Kitchen in mind for lunch when I'm in the neighborhood, good stuff and good prices."
4,"Papilio served great food, has a cosy atmosphere and friendly staff enthusiastic about their job and proud of their restaurant.  \n\nWe ordered the marinated olives to enjoy with the house wine and beer - we had been given the head's up that the Calzone Ripieno would take 15-20 minutes as it is such a thick folded pizza.  It was well worth the wait.  Generously stuffed with mozarella, spicy sausage, ham, mushrooms and tomatoes, it was a perfect match to the Italian beer and red wine.  \n\nWe also ordered the Gnocchi Al Gorgonzola e Spinaci which is as good as I have ever tasted.  I would go back to Papilio for the Gnocchi alone.  \n\nTo finish we had a double expresso each and were given a small bowl of bite sized ameretto biscottis.  They were so good that we cheekily asked for a few more and the waiter generously filled another bowl for us.  \n\nWhen we arrived for lunch, there was a family group of 14 people that were comfortably accommodated so it seems to be a great place for couples, families and groups.  \n\nOur total was just under \u00a340 for three drinks, starter, two mains and two coffees which was well worth it.  We will definitely be returning to Papilio."
4,"Beer Mugs that could crack a skull, check. German band with an accordion, check. Hostesses wearing Dirndl-s? that accentuates their majors in upper body asset management, check. Huge open dining room wit over sized tables and benches, check.  Everything at Hofbraushaus seemed larger than life including the patrons standing on their chairs and downing shots to the chants led by the band.\n\nOur meal was more of a feast including a soft pretzel apps with bier cheese rich enough kill you and the old timer seated at the bar. For my entree I order the wiener schnitzel with steamed vegetables and German potato salad. The pork was fried perfectly and was both juicy and crispy and could easily last 2 meals. The potato salad had a nice balance of spice and was light on the mustard and mayo relative to picnic potato salads. It was a struggle to finish both my meal and my beer, but hey, I'm on vacation. Overindulgence is mandatory."
4,"I've eaten here a few times before, when it was Pink Pepper, but never had the lunch buffet.  A few days ago I decided to check out the buffet offerings.  Everything had great flavor, but I found it all lacking in the spice department.  I know they are trying to make food that is palatable for the masses and one can always add chilies, but I generally prefer my Thai food to arrive pre-spiced.  That said, however, I would definitely go back for more and I did - a few times in fact.  The Thai tea was some of the best I've ever had, I had to order one to go so I could prolong the sweet creamy deliciousness as long as possible.  To top it all off the service was great, and I can't wait to go back!"
4,"This restaurant is really similar to its sister The Cheesecake Factory.  I really like how expansive the menu is and the portion sizes are always enough for a small village, which since I enjoy the food so much, makes for good leftovers.\n\nI like that I can try something new each time, this time was the BBQ Asian Pork Tacos, which I highly recommend.  \n\nThe service is really good, considering the size of this place is massive and its always packed.  \n\nThe downsides are it's VERY loud and its hard to get great service since they are spread so thin.\n\nUpside, they are open late and inside the Venetian which makes it convenient."
4,"This is a great addition to the area.  I am glad we have another choice where to go for mom's night out.  It is a cute place with and interesting menu and wines.  I was not aware until I went there that they make their own wines, and some of them are pretty good.  I was also surprised to see Four Graces Pinot Noir in their list. That was my latest discovery in Oregon and is one of my new favorites.  I couldn't believe they have it, since it comes from such a small winery in Oregon.  I loved the Shallot marmalade bruschetta, it was very tasty.  The salmon roll was really good too.  On Mondays they have a deal for a chef's choice pizza and a bottle of their wine for $20.  When I went with my hubby for Happy Hour, we had the sliders, they were very tasty.  Good place to hang out and my hubby could have his margarita since they have a pretty full bar."
4,"4 stars in the summer on the terrasse and well, lower when not. But really, what a lovely hidden spot. If you've never been here before you'll doubt you're on the right track, but yes, past Foufounes and all the grit and graffiti and closed doors of this bit of St Catherine, up what feels like a dead end alley, and through a small barely marked door and you;re there. A regular old pub that opens onto an completely enclosed terrasse with ivy-covered stone walls stretching up the floors above you towards the sky, lots of seating, wooden benches, high-school era tunes, friendly easy going service, a perfect place to forget how old you are and what time it is and just enjoy. This will help you enjoy the food too which is not bad, but not good pub delivery from a nearby joint. \n\nInside is fine, just a cozyish pub with the occasional good open mic night."
4,I got Jamerica takeout and it was REALLY messy but SO worth it. The mango run chicken was enormous and everything I could have asked for. Each element was flavorful and satisfying on their own but together they were magical. \nThe shop is decorated with photos and letters and seems like a chill place to have a quick meal.
4,"The Phoenix Roadrunner Park Farmers Market is a great little market to find all kinds of produce and local products. The venders are generally about 40% produce, 30% local food products, 15% percent fresh food/drinks, and 15% miscellaneous products.  If you're only looking for produce, it can be difficult to remain disciplined with so many other great local food products, just watch your budget!  I recommend avoiding the parking lot adjacent to the market, it is better to park of 36th Street and take a little stroll through the park. Some of my favorite products here are fresh chili peppers, fresh herbs, unique fruits/vegetables, local dairy products and tamales."
4,"My girlfriend collects robot toys and one of my best friends is a Spawn fanatic so I decided to take a look around. Although there weren't many robots there was plenty more of everything else you can imagine when it comes to toys, McFarlane created or not.\n\nThey had a small, but vital comic archive for the Spawn fan and they offered hard-to-find or unique toys of all genres. Plenty to choose from and even the imports weren't devastatingly expensive. This franchise specialty store can be appreciated by anyone who collects and even for those of us that want to take a look around. Pretty entertaining as a time killer for the masses or a Mecca for the few. I walked out empty-handed, but with a curious smile on my face, my friend on the other hand was pleased with the fare he found to support his hobby."
4,"I like this store- I have a member card so I save 10% every time I make a purchase- believe me, it's worth it. (Also a Hawaiian Miles Mall participant. Free shipping on the website with orders of $50 or more.) I don't shop here when it's regular price- hey, these prices are high. I come here a few times a year when there are two big sales. I buy in bulk so I can give the items as gifts- I shop year-round so I always have gifts on hand, for female friends, anyway. That's one of my shopping secrets. In addition, there are other promotions as well, such as \""Buy 2 - get 1 free.\"" Since I belong to the e-mail club, I get the updates and that's how I am in the know. I really love the Body Butter products ( mango, coconut, shea butter, vitamin E, cocoa butter, raspberry, just to name a few- so often imitated, but not perfected), the gifts (no-brainer gift idea), and the foot kits (great as gifts, but I use it too). \n\n\nThis one's at the Miracle Mile Shops at the Planet Hollywood casino/hotel. I haven't found much during sale time at this one in recent years. I am guessing because there is more exposure to tourists (so I can blame them- ha-ha, just kidding). Still worth a try checking out if you are in the area."
4,"This place is worth it just for buckaroos... even though I'm sure that their 'bucko nuggets' isn't actually made of chicken, getting a drink/hot-dog/nuggets/fries/nachos/ice-cream/packaged cotton candy for about $10 total is awesome."
4,"Booked a south rim tour. Started off really slow, bus took us to the Miracle Mile and then we got put on another bus after getting a danish and coffee/water to start off with. Took a while to get things organized. \nStopped near the dam, a rest stop in Kingman, Az, then had a decent lunch in Williams, Az. The south rim is quite a drive. Once we got there, we had a couple of stops at the canyon for about an hour each, then headed back with one stop again in Kingman, Az. The south rim is a long trip, prepare accordingly. We got back around 9:30 or so. Our driver, Tommy, was excellent and informative."
4,food is amazing. tuna tacos are so good. if you are looking for service dont go there though. its worth the wait though.
4,"Very tasty food. Great grocery store for Mideast products. I have British Lebanese parents, grew up eating all the different styles of this food, one being a bit different than the other. I like this place.This is worth trying..Cheers"
4,Went to zoo lights for the first time and can definitely see how great it is for kids! Went on a Thursday night and it was Packed! The whole zoo is lit up and it is fun to walk around. Admission is $10/adult. FYI most the animals are asleep so don't get your hopes up!
4,"I really liked it. The food was good, the place was clean and the service was nice. I'll definitely come back."
4,"I've been here for two things: An overnight stay, and a wedding.\n\n1) The rooms are really lovely, much prettier than I ever would've expected.  I'm always taken aback by hotel rooms that aren't decorated with those tacky shades of bright green, coral and tan.  This had a pleasant ivory/gold and navy blue color scheme.  The bed was very comfortable.  Everything seemed very clean.  The staff was friendly upon check-in/check-out.  The only problem was that the walls were incredibly thin and we could hear everything that was being screamed down the hallways by drunks at 3 a.m.  \n\n2) My friend's wedding reception that was held here was lovely.  A member of the waitstaff noticed that a friend of mine had spilled her water all over the table and mopped it up before we could even ask for a towel.  Most of the service was great like that, except for a mixup with some of the entrees--but that was corrected immediately upon our request."
4,"You've got to sit in the patio out back. I'm in Texas and have access to all types of great Mexican food. This place holds its own. Beer was cold, food was fresh, chips and salsa were good. I'd go back and I don't say that about too many places."
4,"Ben here a few times for lunch. Its in a tiny strip mall, and parking can be an issue. We have always had the thin crust pizza and it has always been very good. A large usually will feed two of us.. gluttony definately takes over while your here, and you have to remember to control yourself :)"
4,"My boyfriend and I were passing through Vegas on Valentines Day and decided to stay the night. We found a new/updated room at Gold Coast on hotels.com for $30!! \n\nI actually liked that it was off the strip. Since we were driving, it was less stressful not having to drive with a million people crossing the street and not being able to find parking entrances off the strip. \n\nThe room was completely updated, modern and super nice. New bed, new furniture and the bathrooms were cute. No tub, but an awesome stand up shower with a huge shower head! \n\nWhat I liked the very most about this hotel was the parking was easy to find and the check-in was close to the parking structure, our room was easy to find and we didn't have to deal with SO many people in the casino (since they were all older people and no drunken retards from the strip). ANNNNNND the casino didn't even smell of cigarette smoke, what? Unheard of.\n\nThe only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because the check-in agents were so annoying! There were 4 people behind the desk (only 2 were seemingly working) and 1 person in front of us, but it took them 20 minutes to get us."
4,"Wow, talk about a total surprise.\n\nFor the most part, I tend to think of breweries as strictly beer, not food. However, this place is the total exception. The atmosphere is great. Very open and inviting and has a fun warehouse feel to it. We sat down and were immediately given menus for both food and drink. \n\nThe drinks were good. Nothing that really stood out but still good beer that I would go back and try again (and try some of the other kinds as well). However, the food was phenomenal. They go outside the box (soup in test tubes) and have incredible flat breads. The only bummer we ran into is that they don't serve all of their menu items during lunch, which meant I didn't get to try the shrimp and cotton candy skewers (which had been hyped up to me). \n\nCan't wait to come back to Charlotte so i can try entirely different things (especially the cotton candy)!"
4,servings are huge... actually in platters and their menu is so reasonably priced!  great food... comfort food esp. family style =)
4,"Had a Groupon for this place, and I'm glad I went. Although the sides were okay, the ribs were just how I like them, tender and not quite falling off the bone. The sauce was good and plenty of it. I'd recommend this place to anyone who hasn't found decent ribs in Phoenix (and they're hard to find!)."
4,"Dr. Hsueh is a wonderful, thorough, and caring OD. She makes sure you understand what she is doing throughout the exam, and asks you if you have any questions for her.  I like that.\n\nOnce my Rx was determined, I was put in the capable hands of JR (RJ?) who helped me pick out a frame. He was very friendly and professional as well. \n\nSo glad EYE found this place ... It LOOKS like EYE found an OD worth SEEing again. Hope this reVIEW helps you choose Dr. Hsueh too."
4,"What to do if it is 9pm and you want dessert and dessert only? You go to Centotre! \n\nOn arrival our group was greeted by the owner with his elaborate Italian welcoming gestures. I felt special from the get go. he arranged for a table to be cleaned for the 4 of us and ensured we were all comfortable. \n\nThe menu was overflowing with many delicious options and the only niggly bit was that one was similarly named and they brought the one my sister did not want. She enjoyed it, but it should have been pointed out.  My wife enjoyed the affagato with gusto  -hi hi -  see what I did there :o) \n\nMy sister was highly impressed with the entertaining way they teach you Italian whilst being on the toilet - yes you need to go there to know what I mean , but I promise you it will be entertaining and useful! \n\nIn contrast to the attentive service when it came to paying there was not a server to be found, so that dragged the evening a little. When you are a little tired and satisfied this is a little irritating. But we settled the bill eventually and I agreed with my wife we would return for the dessert alone"
4,"The first time I went here years ago, I did not like it. I would not recommend their pasta dishes. However, the pizza's, salads, and sandwiches are all fantastic. The pozookies are one of the best desserts around! Service is always good, atmosphere is great! The Santa Fe salad and the Italian chopped salad are great choices and huge."
4,"Was it the portraits of Cantinflas on the wall or the food that impressed me the most?\n\nNot sure but I was very happy with this place. The portion sizes were \""abuelita\"" style...my term for portions that are almost too much to handle but delicious. We had the Tamales Oaxaqueno and the Four Traditional Moles. Both were beyond great. Plus Horchata and pineapple soda. \n\nI would say the only downside was the service seemed a bit erratic. We had a second waitress try to take our orders before we pointed out we were being served already. There was also a woman going around soliciting for change. It took a while before she was shooed off. Overall though I would definitely come back and recommend Casa Reyna."
4,"I have only been to Famous Daves less than 10 times, but I do enjoy their food a lot. Service is always good and they always seem to have some sort of special going on. I would suggest signing up for their e-mails.\n\nI reaallly love their cornbread. It's sweet and perfect. I wish we could get more than one...\n\nWhenever I go here, I always try to enjoy it to the fullest, so it can get kind of expensive. For two entrees, sodas, and a big appetizer, the total cost was around $70. That isn't cheap, by far, but there is always plenty to take home with you.\n\nNote: The paper towels at your table are a lifesaver when your fingers and face are covered in BBQ sauce!"
4,This is the best pizza I have eaten in Vegas and one of the best pizzas I have ever eaten (the best pizza I have eaten is in downtown Disney). I gave them 4 stars because their service is incredibly slow but in my experience man of the restaurants in Vegas have slow service. Definitely worth a try and I may be going back for seconds before I head home.
4,"I found this place by accident, as it is tucked away in a strip mall with a very unassuming sign.  It has a very Chipotle like fell, with the whole \""build your own\"" but oh so much better, which was shocking to me as well.  The ingredients are fresh, and you can really taste the difference.  They give you healthier options, which is always a nice change.  The guys who work there are ALWAYS so nice and friendly, it's hard not to go back for more.  The chicken, is by far my favorite but they have, shrimp, steak, carnitas, and a veggie option.  \n\nTo make it even better, it is locally owned and operated!!"
4,"I wanted to try this place when I was in Austin, but did not get the chance. My husband and I visited this restaurant at 2 pm on a Saturday, so it was busy but not packed. We each ordered a burger and a beer and shared an order of queso fries. For those who like queso fries the way they are made in Austin, I would not recommend this dish. The cheese sauce is served on the side of the fries. It was very good - just not exactly what I expected. The burgers were delicious - definitely the best in the area. I love the draft beer selection, as this is one of the only places in Arizona that serves a large variety of Arizona-brewed beers. Great place to try  a new bev and I will definitely be coming back. \n\nI'll admit, the ordering system is a bit confusing for Arizonans (you place your entire order and pay at the counter, then they bring out your food), but they do have servers for each table if you forget to order something or need another beverage. They offer self-service all-natural sodas (yay, sugar cane), so you definitely will never need to wait for a soft drink refill.\n\nIn all, two filling burgers, two local drafts and a large order of queso fries ran about $37. I've paid way more for food and drink of a lesser quality."
4,"Armed with a Voucher for a posh Burger meal Anita and I were not disappointed. \nThe burgers are normally served on their lunch menu but for the sake of the voucher they have made those available for evenings too. \n\nRick's is an boutique hotel, and the reception, bar & dining area is functional and modern with warm touches in colour and materials used. \n\nThe voucher had Innis & Gunn as the beer option, but that was not available and I chose the Grolsch swing-top instead. No complaints there :o)\n\nThe burgers were big, juicy and well filled. The fries were skinny and crisp. \nI liked the meal and would recommend taking the burgers here. Though remember that you normally will have to fork out around \u00a310-\u00a313 for the burger - that to me is loosing 1 star. \n\nService was very attentive, efficient and pleasant. Top marks! \nI'd go back."
4,Virgin America gates not far from security check in. Plenty of seating and eateries nearby. Flying in on a Sunday and out on a Thursday the place wasn't crowded so it made fpr a pleasant travelling. Vegas vibe throughout the airport including slot machines in the baggage claim area.
4,Not the biggest Ramen fan but this place is really good! My son had a pork belly bowl he loved it!
4,Great place! Super enjoy the food. The oxtail chili cheese fries are soooooo good! The black and green burger is my fave because I adore bleu cheese and I absolutely love the pineapple ketchup!!
4,"I really like bar food, almost too much, and it's something I probably need help with. I can mostly thank some great spots in my home town, but locally, Zipps can be blamed for my progression.\n\nTheir burgers are consistently hot and flavorful, and the focaccias for the most part are good...even if they're just wraps. But in my book, their wings are my favorite in town. More specifically the golden medium wings have tremendous spicy/sweet balance. And their happy hour specials are some of the best deals anywhere. Anywhere!!!"
4,"This casino, as you might expect, caters to senior citizens. They're heavy on slots and video poker and have probably the largest bingo hall ever imagined. \n\nI met my parents there at noon on a Wed. and found that I was one of about half a dozen players in the 21-30-year old demographic. Most of the dealers, however, are young. One nice thing is that the senior demographic drives the blackjack minimum down to $2. So it's a good place to hone the 21-playing skills without hurting yourself too bad. I settled in at a $5 table and made it out with some cash. I did not see a craps table and the roulette wheel was automated (weird). \n\nI'm sure the younger players show up on weekends because there were more tables that were not open, but overall they do not have a large amount of tables. \n\nDefinitely a good casino, and it is on tribal land. Be careful driving up there and back because Beeline Highway is heavily patrolled for speeders by the Arizona State Police"
4,"My husband and I just ate at this restaurant tonight and it was delicious.  We got hummus for an appetizer and each had the gyro sandwich. He got his with steak fries and I got a side salad. Everything was great. The side salad was exceptional. \n\nThe restaurant is located in a shopping center. The decor is dated, however, it's not quite a dive. The location and decor are the only reasons I didn't give it 5 stars. But the food and owners are great. I will definitely be going back soon."
4,"Tried this place recently for lunch was pleasantly surprised.  The place was packed, and parking was a bit tricky, but was able to get a table pretty quickly.  Typical dive-type establishment...had some 50's music jamming on the radio (which was kind of cool).  The food was pretty good.  I tried the Lamb Burger, and was really happy with that selection.  My wife tried one of the Hot Dogs that was smothered in Chili and Pimento Cheese, which she said was really good.  I do admit that even as good as my lamb burger was, I did have a bit of food envy once taking a look at the Hot Dog smothered in goodness right across from me.\n\nWould definitely go back to this place."
4,I have been to Brio multiple times and we always leave satisfied. They have cheap lunch specials which are always tasty. Last time I ordered a chop salad and a flatbread for like $7 and I had left-overs!\n\nFor dinner they have great pastas and meat dishes. I also love their panini's and salad combo. They also have weekday specials with $5 martini's on wednesdays!
4,"Okay, let me start by saying my review is going to be atypical.  We went to Graze for the Frozen Assets benefit party for Clean Lakes Alliance.  The entire restaurant was transformed to host this large themed event.  The ambiance was quite fun.  Graze catered the event and the hors dourves were very tasty.\n\nThe place was absolutely packed!  From everyone we talked to, people really enjoyed the venue and GRAZE was a very nice host/location for this party."
4,"first happy hour since we arrived back to scottsdale and this place still has one of the best. the sushi and sake are well priced, but still....what's up with the freaking music!!! it's like a club in there, so loud. and when did the waitresses start dressing like skanky school girls? they're nice to look at, but it gives the place a kind of, i don't know, colleg-ish bar feel?"
4,"We went on a Saturday and had to wait a bit but had a drink at the bar. Everyone was so friendly and the food is sooooo good. We had the lunch special and it was plenty. If you use Yelp they also have a spend 40.00 and get 10.00 off . Well worth it. Coming from the NY/CT area we are glad to have found a good Chinese place. \nI had the shrimp and orange and was wonderful. Jay had the mongolian beef, a bit salty for me but he liked it. The hot and sour soup is amazing"
4,The $29 Kobe Burger was outstanding! (actually worth the $29 - highly recommend!) - service was very good - Matt
4,"Yes. It is a small cramped ghetto coffee bar. A dive, if you will. But the chai CAN NOT BE BEAT. The \""barista\"" is far to busy making one cup of coffee at a time to even acknowledge anyone else's presence. So yes it will take longer than usual. If you have 10-15min to get a coffee just get your coffee to go and you probably won't regret it."
4,"The new Stingray location at Scottsdale Quarter makes a nice addition to the growing restaurant scene in North Scottsdale. Entire walls slide open in the bar area to bring the outdoors in. The decor is very sophisticated and the whole place is extremely clean (one of the benefits of being 2 weeks old). I had a nice lunch here today.  As usual, I had the lunch sashimi combination. At $15 the sashimi combo at Stingray is $2 more than the same dish at RA (across the street in Kierland), however the Stingray combo had a side cucumber salad and the miso soup here was more rich and flavorful than the miso at RA. Although they are very close, RA seems to provide more fish but I like how Stingray's slices are a bit shorter and thicker than the slices at RA making the fish more manageable with chopsticks. \n\nI also like how the bar at Stingray is very deep front to back. I felt like I had more room for my elbows, iPhone, book, sunglases, etc... and didn't feel like I was right on top of the bartender as she sliced lemons. The service was adequate and friendly. I would come here again."
4,"I'd never been to any cirque de soleil performance before, so I was excited for this. At first I groaned over having seats all the way in the back, but you're able to see everything perfectly! The set looks like midgar from ffvii. The ushers looked like if Tim Burton had directed Harry Potter.\n\nIt was a great show. The set with it's rotating platform moved in all directions, which mechanically was impressive. It was an easy story to follow.\n\nIf only I had infinite money, because the style of the show influenced really great clothing available at the gift shop."
4,"China Ginger is our go-to place for Lemon Chicken. The lightly breaded chicken is tender and the lemon sauce is sweet and tangy, but not overpowering. The atmosphere is quiet and relaxing with calming music and the servers are really sweet and polite. They are always checking on you and are really quick to respond to your requests. Though I'm WAY past the age for dating, I always think this restaurant would be ideal for someone's first date where good conversation is possible!"
4,"I always get the fish tacos with sweet potato fries. Best in town. I really haven't had better fish tacos anywhere else despite my many failed attempts. They have a decent brunch buffet but you literally won't be able to eat for 3 days, it is an insane amount of food and you get full just looking at it all!"
4,"These are the best, \""mass produced\"" brownies I've ever tasted!  I am very impressed with how they keep the texture and moistness consistent across all of their different types and flavors of brownies.\n\nTheir store is really just a counter with a bunch of different brownies.  This isn't A place to go for dessert.  You show up, you try whatever samples they might have out and then you select which brownies they want.  Their focus really is on selling large quantities of brownies and their mail order business."
4,"The food is excellent  , great special occasion restaurants .. southwest flair not the typical Mexican food . Excellent choices of Tequila  - and cocktails.."
4,"Fat Tuesday, this is the place to be every time we're in Vegas.  \nTo get the day started, we always get the 190 Octane with a shot.  Learned the hard way, but always open the cap after a cup sips and pull up the tube and mix the shot in then.  If you wait, you'll have a nice surprise at the end of your drink, a nice full shot.  \n\nWell worth the price and never fails me when I need to get started in the alcohol consumption in Vegas."
4,"Likle most delis, Peckhams has somewhat of a bizarre effect on me. I love the thought of it, and as I approach the door I get visibly excited at the thought of the numerous culinary treats within. Yet when I actually get inside, I can never find anything I actually want to eat, or can be bothered with the hassle of cooking.\n\nOne day I'll find something I'm sure. That aside, Peckhams is a chain deli with branches in more or less every area that has below average unemployment. Cous cous, olives, fancy bread, cakes and imported booze, you know what to expect."
4,"We came here last night because of a restaurant.com coupon, but couldn't use it because it was a half off bottles Monday... and it did say it on the coupon after reading the fine print. But, we stuck around anyway and we had an enjoyable experience. I love the look of the place. Reminds me of an east coast new york style restaurant with the brick walls. Ambiance is romantic and pretty. Tables are somewhat close together but not unbearable. Probably not the best place to bring children. Food prices are kind of hefty also, but I enjoyed my chicken Gorgonzola dish. My boyfriend got the same thing and he liked it as well. Service was good and fast. Would come back again."
4,"Die neuer\u00f6ffnete Mood Lounge im ehemaligen Kaktus ist eine wunderbare location, mitten im Wald im Norden von KA an einer sch\u00f6nen mit einzelnen Kiefern bewachsenen Lichtung, bei den Sportpl\u00e4tzen. Das interieur ist stylish, man kann drau\u00dfen sitzen, soweit alles wunderbar.\nAls ich dort war, war gut besucht. Leider hatte die Bedienung am Nachbartisch eine Fehlbuchung gemacht und war dann derma\u00dfen damit besch\u00e4ftigt und etwas konfus, dass sie sich erst nach einer knappen halben Stunde in der Lage sah, mir die Karte an den Nachbartisch zu bringen. Ich war kurz davor, zu gehen.\nNach 35 Minuten hatte ich dann einen Tequila Sunrise f\u00fcr 6,50 EUR auf dem Tisch stehen. In einem Longdrinkglas. Die Zusammensetzung war wohl richtig, aber der Barkeeper verstand wohl kein Englisch und wusste deshalb auch nicht, was es mit dem Sunrise auf sich hat bzw. haben sollte. Oder er hatte zittrige H\u00e4nde oder einfach keine Lust, sich die M\u00fche zu machen und den Grenadine zu unterschichten. Jedenfalls enthielt das Glas einige Eisw\u00fcrfel die in einer einheitlich orangen Mischung schwammen. Nicht gut. \n\nAlso: location 5 Sterne. Service und Cocktail leider nur 1 Stern."
4,"Experience the Rat Pack era with an evening at thi old school Las Vegas Steakhouse.  The steaks are good, the drinks are strong and the service is old school fantastic, as if they know exactly what you are thinking. I have ha the bone-in ribeye and the filet mignon... My preference is the filet."
4,"The ambience of this converted Phoenix gem is apparent when you walk up. It's cozy, inviting and hip without being obvious about it. The small bar is nestled between the kitchen and windows facing the outdoor patio, a perfect vantage for enjoying a craft beer. I chose the seasonal Great Divide Wild Raspberry Ale, with amber tones and real raspberry essence. As a bit of a dairy diva, the griddled cheese sammie seemed appealing - it was recommended by several staffers and lived up to it's foodie fame. Paired with the soup du jour (cheesy chicken enchilada), it was taste bud bliss."
4,"Went for a tour which was incredibly packed with daycares since it is the summer but the workers handled it lovely. Pay the $10 to make a chocolate pizza, it is worth it. The chocolate is amazing and there is a large selection to choose from!"
4,I've been here a few times with my cat who always needs to be sedated because he's a tiger in a little body. The staff is very kind and accommodating. Dr. Brown went over everything with me when we were trying to figure out if my cat had pneumonia or asthma. She went over the options and told me the pros and cons. I didn't feel rushed and really felt that the staff cared. They even gave me a few samples to help with my cat taking meds. Thanks Piper Glen Animal Hospital for easing my anxiety.
4,"Dined here on a Tuesday for lunch, wasn't too crowded, service was a little slow as you can tell they have a lot of lunch orders to fill - hence the 4 stars. However, this place is probably thee best place for sushi in Madison.  Highly recommended, you wont be \n\nGreat date spot - definitely recommended for lunch , I am sure wait times will vary depending on the day.  \n\nEnjoyed the salmon with mango ... excellent roll! All the food was perfectly done."
4,"The Shark Reef is a nice place to get away from all the busy crowds and gamblers and something to do if you want to go \""underwater\"". Have now been there twice, but I think the cost of admission ($18 for an adult) is a bit pricey, though (and for those who are Nevada residents, it might still seem expensive even with your locals discount). Manta rays, octopus, sharks and various types of fish were great to see. Plus, a crocodile and other reptiles were featured in the first few exhibits. You'll also find two walk-through tunnels. The aquarium is on the south end of the Vegas Strip inside Mandalay Bay.\n\nI've noticed quite a few other reviewers posting this, but there is a staff member at the interactive manta rays exhibit who has to be constantly telling people how to pet them, and boy, it seems as though he/she has to repeat them constantly all day."
4,Great fast Asian food. Place was packed during lunch. Everything was fresh and flavorful. I like that combos are so cheap and cone with fresh potstickers.
4,"Mert's is very good soul food. Came here with a friend last week. It took a minute for the cornbread to come out because it was hot and fresh out the kitchen. I'm not a big cornbread fan, but slap some butter on this stuff and it's quite amazing.\n\nOur server recommended the ribs, and so I ordered them with the yardbird, mac and cheese and greens. All around great. The ribs were falling off the bone, the yardbird and very good. The mac and cheese was stellar and the greens were some of the best I've tasted in North Carolina.\n\nI finished my meal with the peach cobbler, which was fine, but not great. I kinda wished they had more chocolate options here. I would most certainly come here again."
4,"My in-laws took my husband and I here to thank us for helping them move. I've been wanting to try this place for over a year and I wasn't disappointed. When you first arrive you're greeted with 360 views of the valley. It's an excellent spot to take some pictures--especially at sunset. \n\nWe were promptly seated at a table in the middle of the restaurant after a trip down the slide. We had a great view even though we weren't right beside the window. That was nice. I hate going to a place with great views and staring at the back of the kitchen all night. \n\nWe started with the rattlesnake and cactus fries. I'm glad I tried these unique offerings but I'm not sure I'll try them again. No trip to the Rooste would be complete without them. I had the barbecue chicken and it was delicious. My husband had a burger and his parents had pork chops and prime rib. The cowboy beans are the best I've had. Everyone left happy with a full belly and leftovers to spare. The beer is reasonably priced and served in giant mason jar \""pitchers.\"" The best part is that every meal ends with complimentary cotton candy. \n\nThis is a great place for families and they have a full bar for the adults. Don't miss this place if you're visiting Phoenix and if you live here, why haven't you visited already?\nSay \""hi\"" to Horney the Bull!"
4,"This is one of favorite Italian restaurants in Vegas.  It has an old retro Vegas/Mob fell to it that is kind of tacky but works.\n\nA few housekeeping things about this place ... it's south of the strip, it's pretty much a locals place, it gets crowded (make a reservation) and it's not cheap.  You're going to spend a $15 - $30 per person (with drinks).  You'll get large portions and good quality Italian food.  If that doesn't scare you away keep reading.\n\nI've been here about a dozen time and have always had great service.  I've had great experiences in large and small groups, they do a great job in the service area.\n\nIt's hard to recommend a single dish here because they have all been so good.  I'm going off the beaten path here a bit and say you have to try the garlic knots.  Think bread sticks but 100 times better.  I'd go back for the knots alone.  You're not going to be disappointed with the food, it's pretty damn good!"
4,"This cafe is super cute. It's located in the Paris Hotel and carries a wide variety of fancy desserts. They are all delicious and beautifully decorated. They also have pastries, coffee, and sandwiches. It's a great spot to check out if you want a simple lunch or an afternoon snack while you're in vegas and don't want to break the bank. An americano and a proscuitto sandwich on a baguette cost around $11.\n\nThey also sell merchandise in the back of their store like cups, cookbooks, aprons; some which are paris themed which make it all that much more adorable."
4,"We bought last minute tickets on opening weekend to Zarkana. This show is true to the Cirque du Soleil roots: (1) costumes that would be the envy of any Halloween party; (2) amazing feats of athleticism performed by an energetic cast; and (3) a story line that you pretend to understand, but really don't quite get it. Overall -- Great show that provides for a couple hours escape from the slot machines and tables that drain your pockets!"
4,"Besides witty egg puns, Eggspectations has a wide range of breakfast options; eggs benedict, omlettes, sugar shack and other non-egg based dishes like burgers and pasta. I wouldn't say this is a unique place for brunch but it is reasonably priced and has a nice atmosphere. The dish I ordered when I was last here was the Eggs Florentine, which was quite excellent. \n\nMenu can be seen here:\nhttp://www.eggspectation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Menu_MTL_EN.pdf"
4,"Went here on the last night of my trip to Charlotte. The food was good, service very friendly, nice vibe, plenty of TVS if you want to watch sports (they had sunday night football on when I was there)......portions were huge. I got the pulled pork plate for one (could also order for two) and it came with two sides. I got Mac & Cheese and Fried Okra (very yummy- first time I got that). Lots of booths. Overall good vibe from this place."
4,"Modern but relaxing pub that features elevated British pub food in a comfortable and lively setting showing sporting events from across the world.The centerpiece of the restaurant is a striking bar with an array of beer taps and a backdrop reminiscent of iconic British telephone booths.\n\nWent with a large group and we enjoyed every single dish we tried: deviled eggs, English ale onion soup, shepherd's pie, a selection of sausages, fish and chips, pub burger, butternut squash soup, pork and duck rillettes, beef check sandwich and their roasted jidori chicken. All dishes were delicious and perfectly cooked - truly can't decide what we loved the best (although I have to admit, these were some of the best fish and chips and shepherds pie I've had to to date).\n\nIt was also relatively affordable (although make sure you have the Caesar's rewards card to get the better pricing on the menu). Our waitress was attentive and courteous.  We will surely be going back."
4,"Still on a quest for the absolute BEST donut, so far, even with my unpleasant drive-thru experience last Thursday (another story for a different day), Arizona Donut Co. in Tempe is at the top of my list.\n\nThe ladies here were very friendly, solely what my rating is based off of (even got a free sample of Chai tea w/Boba). The donuts, on the other hand, were JUST ok; they get a whole 2 stars at best.\n\nI tried an old-fashioned glaze and a glaze twist, half of which is sitting in a bag on the counter.  I don't care to taste the oil that the donuts were fried in. Let alone, see it through the dough. Doubt I return for donuts however; there is a slim chance I might try their boba drinks (the guy in line said they're really good here)."
4,Best all you can eat sushi place in town!!! I come here all the time!! Amazing!!! The seared tuna is out of this world!!! If your a local they have a stamp card and after 9 purchases you get one free!!!!
4,Visiting with my parents and they were pretty indecisive tonight. We ended up at vida and they my parents were super please with the food
4,"There are places that sell pizza and places that sell a pizza like substance (Pizza Hut, Domino's, etc).  I would put Brooklyn V's in the category that sell pizza.\n\nStarted off with the garlic knots.  They were very good and the marinara sauce that was served with it was good also.\n\nOrdered the 14\"" white pizza and added pepperoni, onion and garlic.  The crust on the pizza was light and crunchy...so that was a good thing.  The pizza itself was a tad soupy but good never the less.  As it turned out, after the garlic knots (small order) the pizza was more than enough for two with leftovers to go home.\n\nFrom a price perspective the price was a tad high when compared to a place that sells pizza like substance  On the other hand it was competitive with places that sell pizza.  So if price versus quality is an issue than a place that sells pizza like substance may be more in order."
4,"Checked in hours ago and greeted by a nice and friendly receptionist. I was given a room in the first floor. However, I prefer to have it on the 2nd or 3rd floor instead. The receptionist told me there is no room available for today, will only let me go to the new room by tomorrow. GOOD service was given!\n\nSince this is my very first day here, I will continue to see the service given and update the review from time to time."
4,"Folk music fun times. This bar never seems to care how many people they let squeeze in and an impromptu ceilidh is always on the cards. A proper Edinburgh institution this place has incredible acts playing- watch out for anyone folky doing a gig at the nearby Liquid Rooms, there is no doubt that the after party will be here! \n\nUnfortunately Sandy Bells is one of the places that has suffered under the smoking ban. A thick fog of smoke helped to hide the sweaty scent which now dominates the room. Take my advice and get a few beers and ales in you- that way your sense of smell my lessen and you can really enjoy yourself!"
4,"I love this place for quick bites. I first came here when I had a groupon, but that was more than a year ago, and I haven't been back since. Why? I love a good deal: coupons, specials, sales, etc. however, zaba's doesn't offer any of these things (to my knowledge), so it took me a long time to return and pay full price.\n\nSpeaking of full price, their prices are pretty hefty for a fast food joint; I spent about $17 on a chicken salad and a massive shrimp burrito. \n\nEach of the items were large and filling. My sweetie pop and I shared them both and still had leftovers. The shrimp was cooked fresh, but the chicken tasted a bit old and dried out.\n\nAll of the other fresh ingredients that you can add (think Subway) are both healthy and delicious. Of love their sweet potatoes, black beans, fajita mix and brown rice most of all.\n\nOverall, I was quite pleased (and full), I just wished they had some coupons! This is feel good fresh Mex that won't make your tummy say %$!&#! after you've eaten here."
4,"Awesome brunch place!!!\n\nIt's always packed but you get seated in 10 and food comes by 20. \n\nScones are delicious!!!! I love the savory ones! Quiches are great too. If you only want pastries, just walk down a couple of doors on the weekend and there's the pastry shop! And you can save the wait!\n\nI also LOVE pigs in a blanket!! How has anyone not done sausage in pancakes before?! The Mac and cheese pancakes with andouille sausage are really good too!!\n\nI also love the speedy eggwich, if you're into something simple :).  \n\nMy new favorite is the grits with sausage patties on the side!! Best thing ever and I always have leftovers!!! :):)"
4,"I love the Outside Inn. They have a decent beer selection, and the food ain't half bad. My favs are the pretzel chicken sandwich and the sliders. It's bar food, but better than average. \nAlso, wine-o Wednesdays are actually a pretty good deal. \nThis is a bar that my wife and I enjoy stopping in for a quick bite and a beer or two after work. Their air filtration is pretty good too. Don't really notice the smoking unless its right next to me."
4,"Growing up, the Greenland Supermarket was a Lucky's, and little bit later an Albertson's. However, just like everything else on Spring Mountain between Rainbow and Decatur I barely recognize it anymore. Chinatown is getting quite epic. \n\nThis is a review of the food court:\nIn the Greenland Supermarket food court there's a Hawaiian place, a Sushi place, two Korean booths, a Tofu \""casserole\"" place (which I don't think I'll ever try, it sounds kind of disgusting) and a coffee shop which serves Boba but seems to be out of it a lot. \n\nI really wish the Hawaiian place served lumpia and Portuguese donuts but I digress, the spam musubi was quite delish. The sushi place is pretty cheap, for $1.99 they will give you two nigiri, which is about ten nigiri for $10. I also tried Korean food for the very first time when I came to this place, just for the hell of it. I had a kim-chee and meat stuffed bun, which will have to grow on me sadly. It tastes very good at first but the aftertaste is pretty odd. \n\nIn conclusion, I had a pretty good experience here. I wish they had a little more variety (such as a Vietnamese booth or more offerings at the Hawaiian booth) but I will definitely return."
4,"Mmmm!  Yet another update for Sesame Inn!  I was going over to the Byham after work last night for the Richard Thompson concert and I had a LOT of time to kill before the show.  I'm talking about 2 1/2 hours here.  So since I was dining alone and I had a taste for Chinese, I headed up to Station Square for some more Sesame Inn.\n\nMy tastes aren't all that exotic when it comes to Chinese.  The eggrolls here are out of this world.  The shrimp with peapods is a great choice if you just like the basics.  One bad thing about Chinese (besides an hour after you eat it....) is that they always give you way too much.  I wish they had lunch portions for dinner.  Good thing I was able to stop at my office afterwards and stash the leftovers in my fridge.  Leftovers for dinner tonight!"
4,"This is a little Ma and Pa place.  Very sweet.  Everything was fresh.  The hummus was ok. I like mine more garlicky but they can't really be faulted - the have to please the general public and I like everything very  very spicy. I loved the Babajanoush (sp?) super creamy and made with good ingredients and home country / recipe pride (you can just tell!). The pita bread was warm and fluffy and they give you a good amount.  Also really liked the tabulli - perfect mix of oil, cilantro, tomato and grain.  Everything was in balance.  Very nice lunch."
4,"I have been going to Thrive/Fresche for awhile now and LOVE the bowls!  However I do not enjoy eating there at all, the place smells heavily of bleach or some chemical but is not clean??  Especially all the seating, it is stained and looks very dirty. I understand they can not control customers that make a mess but they really need to take more pride in cleaning promptly and replacing items that get destroyed.  Sitting outside is also a no go as it smells of trash. I am sure there is a dumpster near by that is probably out of their control.  With that said my recommendation would be to get your bowl to go and call ahead to avoid the wait. ENJOY!"
4,"Went in yesterday, with a friend of mine. Service was ok, the server just checked on us a minimal amount. Ordered beef tips, and was very pleased with my choice, but needed a to-go box. Packed up my leftovers, left the packed box of food on the table, and headed to the ladies room and my friend came with me, came out and our table was cleaned off, including my to-go box. Found my waiter who had apologized and offered to make a new smaller portion. Did not have time to wait, so declined. Just irritated that they couldn't wait a few moments to be sure the guests had left before they pitched my stuff. I did appreciate the quick way to resolve the issue though."

I'm guessing it's because it's never really too crowded, the prices are decent, and the seats are pretty comfy. I also never really have to wait in line very long when I'm purchasing tickets or getting food because the service is fast. They even offer discount combos at the concession stand. You don't save THAT much, but you get about .50-.75 knocked off the price. \n\nTips\n*Sign up for the Cinemark weekly email for some coupons: https://www.cinemark.com/weekly-email.aspx?status=subscribed\n*$4 movies for seniors Mon-Fri before 4pm\n*Student discount!"
4,Great value for the location.  The rooms are really spacious and the staff was really helpful and friendly.  We got a room in the North tower based on reviews from tripadvisor.com saying that they were more updated.  The only noticeable flaw  was the peeling paint from the bathroom cabinet.   Other than that our stay was fabulous and I wouldn't mind staying there again.
4,"I only know St Leonard's Land from sitting first and second year exams in its halls.  Thus it's not my favourite place in the world, but as far as exam halls go these are pretty good.\nThe whole place feels large and spacious with lots of little stairways leading to 'hidden' gyms and rooms.  I had an exam in the main hall and I was pretty surprised at how large it is, fitting in hundreds of tables and chairs at a time.  \nThe gym which I was in last year wasn't quite as large or lush with scuffed floored, dated decor and not the cleanest of windows.  Nonetheless, all the curtains for the windows did a good job of absorbing any echoes which is perfect for when you'r etrying to concentrate."
4,Sliders and baby brats were extremely tasty. \n\n\n\nMarzen is a household beer and It sits right next to its partner in crime blonde bock.
4,"To Rate Stoney N40 you have to actually look at the two sides of Stoney's, the saloon/food and the club/dance hall. Food half four stars, club/dance hall pushing 3. This is a smoke free location which is a huge plus. I prefered Stoney's over Revolver for this reason.\n\nFirst off with the good: The food and service is excellent. We eat at the bar and the bartenders have always made every meal the best. Each time we've asked to substitute something else on the menu we have been accommodated. I've eaten at Famous Dave's, Mesquite BBQ, Dickie's and Lucile's.. I think Stoney's is on par with Famous Dave's, the customer service, and the local feel gives it a step above any franchise. We eat here weekly and if you don't like the food, your just don't know good BBQ. They need to advertise more though.\n\nThe Bad: The club/dance hall is lacking. They are competing with Revolver which is close by. Stoney's has recently started mixing club music within country music. Listening to Luke Bryant then going to Lady Gaga. It just doesn't do it for me at all. This typically brings in a mix from country hats to flat bill affliction-tapout-wear-young kids. Mostly everyone gets along well. They need to have gaming machines at the bar to bring in more people, which will bring in more revenue and hopefully then they can go back to being a country bar,"
4,"Wary of a place where I can order alfredo pasta, burgers, carne asada burritos, and cheesecake from the same place - was this to be a jack of all trades and master of none?\n\nKudos on the burgers being cooked to order, where you can specify from rare to well-done. I'm a medium-rare and he's a medium, and they were accurately cooked.\n\nThe burger meat was a little bland, and it seems like they use a frozen beef patty based on the shape. They offer a lot of ways to dress it up to make up for this. We got a fried egg on one, and sauteed mushrooms on the other.\n\nVeggies were crisp, bun was buttered and soft. \n\nFries were salty and tasted best when completely coated in ketchup. \n\nPickle was dill-icious, which is a joke I'm pretty sure has never been told before.\n\nMy guy's fruit punch was completely watered down by the time it arrived. I would recommend getting all drinks no ice and adding ice when you're ready to enjoy the drinks.\n\nAlso, ordered an iced coffee. Standard, passable coffee. Pretty cool that it's delivered.\n\nBottom line: Menu is expansive. Burger and fries were average. Delivery is fairly priced and quick."
4,"I love the Original Pancake House, but I always hated going to the SouthPark location because it's always insanely busy, usually has a long wait and the tables are incredibly close together.  This location is much more comfortable and has a little more room to sprawl.  We got there around 8:30 on a Sunday morning and left just as it was starting to get busy.  Delicious pancakes, cheery atmosphere and quick service gets my vote every time!"
4,Lovely interior and tasty food. Went during first week & got a 1st come / 1st serve table in bar. No gluten free entrees on menu but they were able to come with a lovely punt. Looking forward to returning to see the next generation of the menu & a few opening kinks ironed out! Overall - highly recommend but call in advance for reservations or go early for a walk-in table.
4,Probably the best buffet i had ever eaten at.  The food choices were plentiful and the food was delicious!  You definitely need to come here hungry so that you can taste a little bit of everything.  Definitely will be coming back here again.  A little on the pricey side but well worth the food.
4,"This is a new cool spot inside Aria, they have great food and a great vibe.  I've been in there a few times and every time their is a good looking group customers and the good service makes it a comfortable place to jam before the club and or a show.   Go see my boy john Venegas."
4,"Had a cheese pizza today. The food and service were good! Definitely worth a visit if you are craving a good pizza. Salads were also very good, and the service was prompt,"
4,"What a fun place to spend the night! Sure drinks are expensive but the people are super awesome and friendly here! I wanted to have some fun on a Friday night and stopped by here because it looked like a fun time and I wasn't disappointed. \n\nThe inside is pretty small and there's lots of people crammed in so it ends up being pretty hot which is even worse when you're dancing. I walked up to one of the bars and told the bartender to surprise me. I ended up with something called an electric lemonade which was delicious! It took a little bit to get the bartender's attention but they were really busy so I can't really blame him, and a group of people pulled me into their conversation while I was waiting so I didn't even notice. I've been in clubs/bars before but I've never had so many people walk up to me and just strike up random conversations, I even got invited onto the balcony with the fire pit which was reserved for a private party and was told to take advantage of the bottle service while I was there. Hurray for Grey Goose and Red Bull!\n\nKazba thanks for showing me a fun time. Between the friendly people(Even the bouncers are cool!), awesome DJ, and cool cocktails I'm impressed."
4,"Amazing set, the performers do things that are just mind blowing. I couldn't really follow the entire story, but got the gist of it. The story line isn't why you go anyway. Overall enjoyable experience."
4,"Nice little hidden gem on the north side of town.  Gave me the feeling that I was in the move \""Swingers\"".  Good mix of drinks with island inspired names. Video poker and slot machines at the bar but dont expect ti get comp drinks unless you put in a $20 and are betting max credits. Funky jutebox all with vitage music.  Arrive early and snag a seat in the back or at the bar- the tables in center of the lounge are uncomfortable and kinda feel like a childrens play table - if you have tall or more curvy friends get a table in the back with the couches. Bartenders were pretty friendly and were preety quick on the service. Look forward to my next visit."
4,"Food: Amazing... had the bone in Rib eye... ridiculously good!\nPrice: expensive, but it IS Vegas.  That's why I give it 4 stars.\nAmbiance: nice, but not overly done.\nService: waiters and staff were superb! \n\nOverall: I highly recommend it if you're looking for an amazing steak and don't mind paying a premium."
4,"Nice out of the way all you can eat sushi place.  I usually eat enough nigiri to make the trip and price worth while but as a discerning certified asian, I eat muuuuch more than I can handle.  I can eat way more fish than the $25.95 all you can eat price.\n\nOnly restriction is one uni and amaebi dish per person (and one toro when they have it).  The tempura here is very well done and somehow, in the middle of a desert, the fish is quite fresh.  Definitely a place I'd go back to when I'm in town."
4,"This is our go to place for Chinese food everytime we go to the airport.  The first time we went the service was terrible, but the great food brought us back.  \n\nWe visited the Palace again last night and it was 100% better.  We had a gentlemen as our server and he was humorous and very tentative to our party's needs.  We ordered our food and 5 minutes later we had all four dishes in front of us (fresh and not pre-made).  My personal favorite is Szechwan chicken.  However, everything we had was great.  The food is very good quality Chinese food and it isn't overly greasy.  I love Chinese food, but it doesn't always love me back (if you know what i mean)!   The ambiance is very nice and the noise level is very tolerable. \n\nWhen you check-in using the yelp app it says you will receive a free dessert - but they don't honor it for some reason."
4,"We enjoyed the grand opening at the Summerlin location. The place looks great and the staff was great. We enjoyed the evening and almost everything. However, the bar-be-que shrimp was a disappointment. Four medium out of shell overcooked shrimp with hard rice. Lets do this classic dish correctly. Use large in shell shrimp and rethink the sauce. Missing the garlic."
4,"I like this place as it is close to home and has good beer.  With that said, service varies and can be lackluster."
4,I just discovered this place after trying to find a place that delivers. I must say at 8 months pregnant I wasn't thrilled waiting 50 minutes for the food to arrive but at least it was worth it!! I had the California club and a goo ball. The club was excellent! The goo ball... let's just say I ate it very quietly and didn't give my 6 year old a bite until she noticed I had dessert. It was so good!! I can envision future trips if nothing else to fill a goo ball craving. Can't day anything about the restaurant itself as I haven't been but the food was delish and had I not ordered right in the middle of lunch hour I'm sure my food would have been delivered faster. All in all I'll be going back.
4,"i like lai lai's a lot, but my lady is not the biggest fan (she says it's not spicy at all, even when she gets extra red chili oil, which is lame, she just said). i don't really like spicy so that's probably why i like this place, because their sweet sauce is pretty awesome.\n\nthey have the best noodles that i have found at any mongolian place in the valley. the worker lady is super nice and always acts like she remembers me, which rules. their pineapple is too big, though. it seems impossible to find good pineapple in phoenix.\n\nalso, it's a little expensive. and they don't let you take leftovers even if you just get one plate. to-go orders are priced by weight."
4,A really classy hotel with higher-end restaurants/rooms/service/etc.. but basically they try to gouge the shit out of your for everything.\n\nThe standard rooms are just slightly better than a standard vegas room at another 4* hotel on the strip and are pretty much the same size so if you're trying to fit masses of people in here then you're better off paying for a suite at a lesser hotel.\n\nEither way its really nice and if you have cash to blow then you'll find tons of places to do it here.
4,"A great place to enjoy some dumplings. ....\n\nPlace is small. Good for a group of max 4-5. Friendly staff and fast delivery..\n\nI went with my gf while checking out China town. When we walked in, the place was full and had to wait for few mins. Seems like a family run place..decor and atmosphere are okay not fancy...\n\nMenu is simple and ranges from 5-9 for 15 dumplings...and salads r 1-1.50..yes its max one dollar\n\nI tried the wasabi salad..Awesome...then beef and onion dumplings...shrip+pork+ coriander dumplings...so far the best I tried...and waiting for the food was max 5- 10 mins..\n\n A great place and will definitely go back 100%\n\nPlace is authentic dumplings. ..u only get dumplings there not like some other places where u get fried rice to sushi. ..\n\nI been to many places and never bothered to write review so please lemme know if this helps. ."
4,"I am truly fascinated with this exhibit.  The bodies on display with the different body systems is very educational.  As a person who hated science in school, I find this kind of science to be entertaining and educational.\n\nTo see the arteries and veins in different parts of the body with the rest dissolved is incredible.  It really helps one understand how it all goes together.\n\nThis is an exhibit I'd recommend to anyone.  Since MGM Resorts is having a special, experience 3 attractions for $54, you can see these two and throw in the CSI Experience at the MGM Grand itself.  It's a nice savings."
4,"The Orleans Hotel consistently get s high ratings in Las Vegas as the best hotel for your dollar value.\nI would totally agree.\nThe rooms are large and comfortable.\nThe pool is nice and provides an equal balance of sun and shade.\nThey have some good bars, good places to eat.\nThe hotel just opened a TGI Fridays and it is generally packed.\nThey have a bowling center and 18 theater complex on the upper floors.\nYou can always sneak into an extra feature if you are so inclined.\nI usually am inclined to do so ......\n\nI have stayed at the Orleans for their slot tournament during the past two years.....\n99 dollars for three nights and entry into the tournament.\nRight now I am 0 for 4 in winning anything !!\nBut I'll try again in July ....\n\nThe only drawback I can find about this hotel and casino is that it is off the strip on Tropicana Ave.\nHowever, the Seamless Gentlemans club is just across the street.\n\nYou can do a lot worse in Vegas than the Orleans\nEspecially when you factor in what you are paying to stay there ...."
4,"Now while i am not a huge fan of Mexican food...my  wife is and that is why i am reviewing this place...because she sends me to this \""hood\"" on a regular basis. When we were here in June she went twice in the same week and i have already there again since we moved here. She loves the the Burrito enchilada style with green sauce and rice and beans. I promise you when you get this food they put it in a container that keeps it hot for at least 3 hours...and i mean hot people. Now there are only about 5 items on the menu...and i will post those pics as well...and you will see that this Mexican food is expensive.\n\nDespite all of that though there is always a crowd at this neighborhood spot...and you will see people from all walks of life there for lunch every single day. Now noticed i said lunch because they only stay open to about 4pm and then they are ghost folks...LOL. So i have to say if you want authentic Mexican food and don't mind going to the \""hood\"" to get it...it will be the best 8 bucks you ever spent on Mexican food...at least that's what my wife thinks...LOL. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my friends!!!!"
4,I was so excited to come here!!  The custard was amazing I give it a 5 but the icee I wasn't to fond of overall I tried lemon lime cherry chocolate chip strawberry-mango and cucumber melon..  And only really liked the last 2 flavors so as long as u make the right combinations up have a great experience here
4,"Love this place! Only reasons it's getting 4 stars instead of 5: the calamari appetizer was very small, maybe 7 or 8 rings, and they don't have soda water. Otherwise the place is a great value. Nice atmosphere, friendly and attentive service and super tasty hibachi dinner for the price of lunch? Yes please!"
4,"Not too far from my office. Been here for lunch a few times now. All in all a pretty good spot. Quick and relatively cheap (for sushi). \n\nThey have a wide selection of items. All of which whisk by you on a conveyor belt. There are even some just plain funny items - cream puffs, jello pudding, canned fruit, etc.. \n\nAgree with some others that the service could be better. However, splitting checks is easy and I have never had a problem getting everything I asked for. \n\nHave not been here for dinner so could be different. \n\nThe photos of tables with plates stacked up are pretty funny."
4,"My boyfriend has a timeshare here so we stayed in a one bedroom suite.  It was my first time in Vegas and I liked that this hotel was off the strip.  They do not have a casino but I do not gamble.  I know what you are thinking...why come to Vegas and not gamble?  I decided to visit Vegas for the ambiance.  This hotel was perfect for that.  Our one bedroom suite was comfortable and it had a living room area with a large flat screen TV,  a large kitchen with a microwave and refrigerator, and a huge bathroom.  We also had a nice view of Las Vegas.  I recommend this hotel if you are not a party animal and just want to take in the sights."
4,"Dinner was great!! Baby spinach salad with warm bacon salad was probably my favorite. I got the filet and my husband got the ribeye. Both were delicious...however, I hate to say it but my favorite steakhouse is still Ruth's Chris. Don't get me wrong though, this place is worth going to!"
4,"My first experience there was terrible, but this is a great company and they made it right for us in a big way. We were treated like VIP's the second time around and the food was awesome. I can't think of better Mexican food that I've ever had. It is still a little pricey I think, but this is a capitalist country right. They can charge what they want if the food is great and it is."
4,"The stock of cupcake flavors seemed to be running low when I popped in, (not surprising since it was half an hour before closing). DON'T PANIC. The lovely cupcake girls announced that while they might not be visible in the display case, at least 10 varieties (those on the board with a dot by them) were back in the kitchen and could easily be frosted if any of us customers so desired. Cupcake crisis averted.\n\nBut the best part about my visit was getting a free red velvet cupcake for mentioning the Twitter secret code: \""sugar rush.\"" Follow http://twitter.com/sprinklescupcks and you'll be in the know too for their next freebie.\n\nOh, did I mention they also have the cutest website? And seasonal flavors too, including for Passover, Cinco de Mayo and Mother's Day this month. I'm headed up this weekend for some Key Lime perfection."
4,"We had lunch here and loved it. Had a wonderful sandwich and everyone in our group loved everything they got. But to be honest the dessert we had, still to this day, pleasantly haunts my dreams. We ordered the GIANT layered chocolate cake and the cake was SO moist, I couldn't believe it. But the frosting blew my mind, and I'm fat mind you, so I have high standards. The frosting was like fudge from Disney World or Rocky Mountain Chocolate factory. It was totally unbelievable. I occasionally have to ask my wife if that was a real experience cause it was amazing and sometimes I think it had to have been only a dream, but it was real. Love this place."
4,"As a local from Hawaii, this is place is pretty good. I tried: \n\nKalua pork and cabbage\nHamburger steak\nKorean chicken\n\nThe korean chicken was fantastic. Just alittle but of crunch on the skin of the chicken and just the right amount of spice. \n\nI've had better Hamburger steak, but it'll have to do. I wish there were more vegetables on the plate\n\nI've had waaaay better kalua pork. There isn't much flavor to it. \n\nThe mac salad on all the plates was just like home in Hawaii. Just a dash of pepper and it was like being home. \n\nI really disliked the cash only deal. You're in a casino, people."
4,"So surprised how great the service is at a fast food kinda joint. The place is nice and roomy and well decorated. Lots of stuff on the wall to read while you waiting on your food. And the Caniac, YUM! Perfect amount. Something about their dipping sauce... its good stuff.\n\nThe sweet tea is too sweet for my taste, so I mix it with half unsweetened tea. Then I heard about the lemonade and wow, it was delish! Even when all the ice melted, well, while it was still cold, it was good.\n\nYou better believe I will be back all the time :) And they got a drive thru.. perfect!"
4,"This is the Target for which my entire Target list is dedicated to.  Fond memories from high school of hanging out with friends, hopping down to the Target and checking out the new stuff.  Sometimes just popping in to get a Coke.  Ever since, no matter where I am, Targets remind me of home.\n\nThis location has always been clean and well stocked, even though it's been open for over a decade now.  It's got a huge lot and lots of spaces, and a Target cafe for quick eats, but no Starbucks as another reviewer has mentioned.  It's not a SuperTarget, so don't plan on doing your grocery shopping here, but some snacks and a small refrigerated aisle is available.\n\nTargets are a product of their environment, and being in Silverado Ranch makes this a pretty clean and safe alternative to WalMart."
4,We had a great experience. Great service from a sweet waitress. My filet was perfectly cooked medium rare and I loved how the greens were dressed. My husband had the beer brined chicken wings with an avocado sauce and a Caesar salad. The wings were delish and he raved about the salad...crispy pigs ear crackles on top were awesome. The only disappointment was my roasted cauliflower side dish. It was kind of cold and not as described on the menu. Loved the funny decor in the restrooms! The dining room decor is nice. We were brought warm towels after dinner...nice touch.
4,"The salmon at this sushi house is TO DIE FOR.  Salmon Kama, Salmon sashimi, I Love Salmon Roll.... all of which are dreamy!  The kama is crisp on the outside and lusciously velvety goodness on the inside.  The sashimi is divine and melts in your mouth.  The salmon rolls are quite tasty too, if you're in the mood for sushi. \n\nOn the other hand, I'm not  a big fan of their non-salmon sushi, and the seaweed salad is a little underseasoned.  \n\nAnything fried is good though - soft shell crab, tempura, etc.  \n\nThere's all you can eat for $20, but with almost every hour of every day being half-off happy hour, there's always a good deal to be had here ;)  [Additionally, they have listings on restaurant.com too]"
4,"Yeah, I saw someones ass hanging out of their basketball shorts (must have been laundry day cuz he didn't have any underwear on), but that's part of the adventure. \n\nI hate driving downtown (ok, I hate driving in general) so this alternative is a dream come true. The carts were clean and we didn't have to wait long for one to ever come by. We didn't have any problems and it stopped for a light maybe 3 times from the end of the track in Mesa to downtown and back. We got on and off about 3 times and we never saw anyone checking tickets even when it was packed and standing room only.\n\nI can't wait until this thing runs until 2 am next month so we can check out some more places downtown and in central Phoenix."
4,"I came here once for lunch and was very pleased.  With all the great reviews on the chopped salad I new I had to try it.  It was the BEST chopped salad I've ever had!  It had the feel of an upscale pub, with upscale prices.  I would definitely come back for the salad."
4,"I like this location just as much, or maybe a little bit more than the Los Feliz one. The music on the juke box was pretty good. Better than what they were playing next door at the Beauty Bar at least. \n\nOn a Friday and Saturday night, there was a good crowd, but still managed to find a cozy seat.\nToo bad it was right across from a couple that were pretty much close to fucking right there on the couch. The guys moves were pretty entertaining to watch though. Entertaining and gross."
4,"I was Ill prepared for the lavish world that I was stepping into. I was under dressed and was expecting something rustic (why, I dunno). Whilst the building in which the Wine Loft is housed is fairly new and modern, it gives zero indication of the chic ambiance lurking inside. I seriously had a \""woah\"" moment upon entering.\n \nRich, dark, masculine undertones are complimented with black contemporary furniture. Dimly lit lights make for an intimate and romantic environment to either impress that hot date or vibe with the music with a nice glass of wine. Low key, mature and just plain sexy."
4,"Holy Yummy!!' The Wagu Beef Sliders were out of this world! The pork belly was so good as were the mashed potatoes and our Filef. The atmosphere was super cool, the music was AWESOME!!! The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was because our server was super terrific but the assistant servers were a little weird...other than that, great great time and a must go if you are in Vegas!"
4,"The restaurant has great food and tons of sweet desserts to choose from.  If you are staying at Paris Casino, this is a good alternative option for breakfast or lunch.  The candy store that is connected to the restaurant is a typical candy store with little sweet treats everywhere.  If you are a Total Rewards members for the Harrah's casinos, you can use your comp points in both the restaurant and the candy store."
4,"Pho Da Lat was a great impromptu lunch decision on a Saturday afternoon when I had an hour or so to kill with a friend. 2pm on a Saturday almost no one was in there, which I like. \n\nWe were immediately led to a table and given menus. The staff gave us enough time to look over our menus and think of any questions we wanted to ask in our heads first. When we finally ordered, we decided to try the quail appetizer and then each had questions on dishes. In response to my guest's questions, samples were brought out to try, which I thought was excellent.\n\nI asked their opinion in regard to the best of the spicy flavorful dishes and it was suggested I try the lemongrass chili chicken which I did. \n\nUnfortunately, our food came out and our appetizer was forgotten about. However, the food was plenty and I ended up not even being able to finish it all anyway. The spice was right on par and we both seemed to enjoy our lunch there. \n\nI will be back again, as I found several dishes I wanted to try, which is the key to high rating and return visit with me, and hopefully next time I will try the 40+ advertised wines. All at once you ask? Hmmm... let's see where the night goes..."
4,"What you say? A hot pot all for myself? Yeah!\n\nI had the lamb hot pot and my partner had the beef hot pot ($9.99 each). The lamb broth had a vinegary tang to it, which I liked and the beef broth had a good hearty flavor. Both came with tofu, crab sticks, tofu skin, mushrooms, a fish ball (with pork inside), bok choy, carrots, tomatoes (ideal for a good broth flavor), and their respective meats (thinly sliced). We ordered add-ins of fish balls ($1.50) and noodles ($1.50), which we split between us, and spicy level 4.\n\nThe broths were very flavorful and you could adjust the flame below if you wanted it more or less bubbling hot.\n\nIt was our first time there, so the owner was very helpful in explaining how it worked, which we both appreciated. She also showed us how to do the sauces, even offering to make one \""special\"" for us. I mixed green onion, cilantro, and garlic oil; my partner was quite fond of the garlic oil and Chinese BBQ sauces together.\n\nTip: the ingredients can be quite hot, so take out the goodies and put them on a plate to cool off a little before wolfing them down.\n\nWhile I wish we hadn't waited so long to finally stop in,  now that we have, we will definitely be back. Next time, we're going to try some of the skewers they offer, too."
4,"I really like this Olive Garden location so close to home for me.  After a very disappointing experience at a different location (see my review of the Olive Garden on Centennial), I came here and received the best service.  I was seated right away.  My drink came out right away.  My soup came out fast and hot.  The Chicken Marsala was delicious and perfectly cooked.  I ordered a dessert to go which my server comped after hearing about my woes at the other location.  I told her that was very unneccessary and I mean that most sincerely.  I would have had no issues paying for my dessert but it was nice of her to care.  This is certainly my go to OG."
4,"Sunday breakfast at 3pm! Yes, I am a fan!\n\nIf only this place is not hidden in the corner of a building in Civic Center, I'd find it a long time ago! There we are, stopped by at 3pm for a late breakfast, and we enjoyed every bite of our food! \n\n-Freshly squeezed orange juice - yes, not from a bottle or a can, you can taste the freshness, so get a large glass! (medium size is the size of the water glass which you'll see once the water is delivered to your table)\n\n-Original French Toast - yummy! nothing special but the original! That is all we need!\n\n-Banana Nut Pancakes - my fav! pieces of banana and pecans 'hidden' in the puffy pancake top with maple syrup! I paired my pancakes with seared/fried(?) prosciutto, saltiness and sweetness all together! can I come back tomorrow?\n\n-Soup of the day - Chili - yes, this cup of chili was spicy!\n\nService was excellent as we were the last table at the restaurant, we did not feel any rush that we need to leave as the clock ticks to 4pm (when they close). One thing I wish our server had said was that the portion is big. Both the French Toast and Pancakes are very big dishes, if you are not so hungry for a huge meal, share your plate!"
4,"Pretty good burgers!  This place has a cool concept of \""custom-built\"" burgers.  You select everything from the type of meat, bun, cheese, toppings and sauce.  Finally you can order a good burger that tastes home-made without it being a gut-bomb!\n\nMy only complaint about why this place doesn't get 5 stars is that it can be rather pricey...lunch for two with two burgers, sharing a small fry, and some waters can run over $20, which is a tad bit ridiculous for burgers.  Still, you can create some awesome combinations that you won't be able to find anywhere else, and I guess for the great ingredients it's worth the price of admission.  Definitely would go back!  Wish they had more around the nation -- I was only passing through Charlotte on my way to DC from Atlanta."
4,"I love firebirds and eat here often, they have one of the best hamburgers around if you are willing to pay the $$ also addicted to their house salad... great specials during the week and the bar area is a nice place to relax, especially when its cold and the fireplace is going."
4,"I stopped here for lunch and the service was fast and friendly.  The food was fresh and wasn't greasy.  Overall, I was pleased with this place and will be back again."
4,"I had bought a early 90s 4runner on the cheap, knowing it needed some work.  Among other things, it had one hell of an exhaust leak from the rusted out cat.  Advance was able to weld in a replacement that fit my budget and did the work while I waited.  They're my go-to for all things exhaust related now."
4,"I have driven by this location numerous times and would try to remind myself to go there when out with friends, but just never seemed to get around to it...until last week!  This location serves up the same great food as the other locations, but isn't as busy.  I will definitely come back.  \n\nIf you are looking for the atmosphere of the one on Central, you won't find it.  It's more like the one in Mesa, but even toned down a bit compared to that one.\n\nGo for the food!!!  The service was great and everyone is just as friendly so what are you waiting for?  Get in there and eat some food!"
4,"Like most food in this town, I'd say it is \""pittsburgh good.\"" In another city, their pho would be decent-but-not-awesome, but in Pittsburgh, this is the best pho in town. I know it's weak praise, but hey. Their pho is still good enough to stave off intense cravings if you're stranded in the 'burgh. The other two pho places I've tried in pittsburgh were SO bad, this place was a bit of revelation. So everything is relative."
4,"Guess what?  I'm a guy and I can sew a button back on and sew a small, albeit ugly, patch on torn fabric.  But that's it, I cant needlepoint or anything.\n\nI had a few items to be repaired and one item to get hemmed. Good prices, $5 per repair, and $10 for the hemming.\n\nVery nice work done by a couple of friendly ladies."
4,"Papa Murphys is by far my favorite of the chain pizza available in Las Vegas. I always get the DeLite crust, as it reheats much better than the thicker crusts. You get to pick your toppings, and they have a bunch to choose from. The sauce is good, and the toppings always taste fresh. \n\nLook online for coupons before you go. The website always has some, and there is usually one for the DeLite crust. You can call ahead, but it usually only takes a few minutes if you go in to order.\n\nThe reason I can't give them 5 stars is because they always seem to be out of something. One time, it was the DeLite crust. They stretched the regular crust out instead. They have been out of bacon at least twice while I was there, and various other toppings at one point or another.\n\nBut if you are looking for a cheap, tasty pizza and don't mind cooking it yourself, go to Papa Murphys."
4,"Quick hitter here. Woke up on Saturday morning with a strong desire to try something different on my way to the market so I decided to finally go try a place that has been on my radar all summer: Chez Boris.\n\nChez Boris is in the Mile End district on Park Avenue between Laurier and Fairmount and their speciality is doughnuts. For 75 cents each, you can get amazing fresh made-to-order doughnuts coated in a variety of different options. For my first visit (and it certainly won't be the last...), I got 2 sugar, one cinnamon and one raspberry. Each was perfectly cooked with a nice crisp exterior and a light fluffy interior which is all that you can ask for in a perfect doughnut.\n\nSo you're interested in something outside of the usual donut shop for a quick hit of sweet, give Chez Boris a shot. You won't be disappointed. Also, any place that uses a SNES as a card holder deserves your attention ;)\n\n\nCheers!"
4,"I checked out Logan's Roadhouse a couple of weeks ago for lunch. I picked up a buddy from Sky Harbor and this place popped into my head. We had a late 2 ish lunch so the place was not busy.\n\nOur service was excellent, the soda refills kept us happy. But not as happy as those dinner rolls. My dinning companion had never been to a Logan's before, now he can strike one more thing off of his bucket list. I mean, aren't those dinner rolls to die for?\n\nI had the pork chop along with the sweet potato fries. And let me tell ya, the pork chop was cooked to perfection, very juicy. And how can you go wrong with the cinnamon and butter in your sweet potato. I also had the perfectly cooked broccoli to balance out the meal.\n\nAnd of course the perfect ending to a perfect meal was when my buddy pulled out his wallet to pick up the tab. It must have been the dinner rolls!"
4,"I'm not giving a 5-star just because I have yet to taste any of their boba drinks. But I did try their Deli Manjoo that were so addicting and delicious! The owners had brought over a few samples for our work near by to try and we have been hooked! \n\nJust today, I went by to get the Deli Manjoos but their machine was broken (BUT THEY ARE IN PROCESS OF FIXING IT ASAP!!!!!!) so I got myself a combination chicken and lamb baguette sandwich and it was so delicious!!!!!!!!  \n\nThe (new) owners were such sweethearts and so kind! They are always so welcoming and always smiling :) I will definitely go back, even if I'm not working or just near by!"
4,"Rolled up on a Tuesday night since I had to kill about 1.5 hours while waiting for someone to arrive at the airport.  Old Pewter Rose location (RIP).  Place was pretty busy and since I didn't have time to wait they offered us the counter right at the kitchen which was open.  Kind of like a Chef's table but they called it something different.\n\nThe experience was doubly awesome since we got to watch them prepare all of the yummy dishes.  We were right there facing the line cooks and chefs.  Both me and my co diner ordered the nutty fried chicken on the recommendation of the server.  It was served with sweet potato mash and asparagus.  The entire plate was quickly devoured and I must say it was very tasty.  Oh, and they started us off with one of the most wonderful, fluffy rolls that I have ever eaten.  Since I was right there I noticed a sign that said that the rolls, before being served had to be approved by a chef before going out.  Pretty cool, and maybe that contributes to the hot, doughy perfection that I ate.\n\nAll in all, it was a great experience at a renovated old favorite restaurant of mine.  I will definitely return so I can try other things on a menu that I really didn't have time to properly peruse but remember there was some pretty great stuff on it."
4,"Had lunch here today with my husband, we ordered the veggie spring rolls with the sweet chili and plum sauce, very tasty. The restaurant itself is interesting, abit dark. The waitress was very nice, and our food came quite quickly. We ordered chicken phad thai to share, mild spiciness, extra peanuts. I was alittle disappointed at the lack of spice, but all in all, the dish was really good. We asked for some red chilis and added some spice to the dish ourselves. Very yummy. I am from the Seattle area originally, so I know good Thai food. This has been my best experience so far, and I've tried a few places looking for great phad Thai. I'd come here again, but I have faith that I can find better :)"
4,"Came here with a bunch of friends (Group of 5) for breakfast. Luckily we came before the place got busy. Two of us ordered the iced tea. It was just okay. Watered down and not a lot of tea flavor.\n\nFor main course I had the Cowboy Omelette with cinnabun pancakes. I also tried the carrot, red velvet, and wheat pancakes. Ranked from most to least favorite: Cinnabun, Carrot, Red Velvet, then Wheat.\n\nThe cinnabun pancakes was flavorful and not overly sweet. I would highly recommend this pancake. The carrot pancake was good but couldn't taste the carrot flavor. It was very mild and it basically looked like the wheat pancake but a little sweeter. The red velvet was fairly dry and the melted sugar overpowered the red velvet. \n\nThe cowboy omelette was okay. The eggs were overcooked but there were lots of ingredients in it. I would have preferred the eggs to be a little more watery and the vegetables a little less overcooked. The fried potatoes were okay. It was not overly salty and not burnt at all.\n\nOverall, I would give this place 3.5 stars. This place is good for breakfast and I would come back here again. Portion size was excellent. They do give a lot for breakfast. Unfortunately, it just missed the mark on certain things. Service was excellent. Pancakes here are excellent. Next time I'll try their french toast and another egg dish to test."
4,cool and open.  Little pricey but they give you good stuff in the ambience.  Wish you didn't have to pay to go downstairs.
4,"I think this place deserves between 4 and 4.5 stars. It is new and the service was impeccable.\n\nThe food is great value for your money ($45/person) and the wine can be as affordable as $30 bucks a bottle, or as high as hundreds of dollars.\n\nThey wouldn't call themselves a buffet, but it kind of has the same idea. You start at a unlimited salad bar, and honestly, there's not much salad about it which was awesome. They had mozzarella, parmigiano cheese, prosciutto & salamis, their very own smoked salmon, in additon to salad, as well as soups.\n\nWhen you're ready, they will start bringing out the meats. Make sure to ask for filet mignon, they had it but were stingy about taking it out! Their ribs are also melt-in-your-mouth and their lamb didn't have much of a gamy taste. Skip the chicken if you can, this place has a TON of  better meat choices than that.\n\nOh, also, TAKE YOUR TIME! My friend went crazy and then threw up 30 minutes into the meal...You really need to take your time here and don't rush, even if the servers seem pushy with cutting you the meat.\n\nIt is an enjoyable experience though and looking forward to doing it again =)"
4,"I live in the area and have been wanting to try this place for a while.  I took my friend here for a celebratory dinner last week.  Overall, we like this place.  Service was very good.  The bottle of wine we ordered was out of stock, so our server suggested another bottle but offered it at the same price as the bottle we wanted.  Nice gesture.  \n\nThe corn cakes with pulled pork appetizer was probably the highlight of the meal.  Very good.  The Arcadia Salad was also good.  Being from New Mexico and loving green chile, the green chile Mac n Cheese was a little dissapointing.  The ribs were ok.  Certainly not fall off the bone.\n\nLove the ambiance and openess...with the exception of the music.  More about that below.  Interesting artwork with the chalk board feature, although it is so cluttered to the point that we couldn't take it all in.  Sometimes less is more.  \n\nAs I aluded to earlier...I'm a firm believer that music is the single-most make or break factor to a great ambiance.  The music simply does not fit.  Paula Abdul did not add to my enjoyment of dinner in any way.  Maybe we were just at a cheesy point of the mix, but I think some more edgy/progressive/hip music could do a lot in further creating an enjoyable ambiance.\n\nOverall, I'm a fan.  Good Job."
4,"I had the cheese pizza and zeppole, both were very good. The service was friendly, but not fantastic. Definitely worth the time to visit."
4,"Burger Bar is a cool concept by Chef Hubert Keller.  Build your own burger.\n\nChoose from all kinds of meat: buffalo, lamb, angus, kobe.\n\nChoose your temperature and tons of toppings.\n\nThe most massive burger is the Rossini.  It's $60!  It is Australian Kobe-style Wagyu beef, saut\u00e9ed foie gras, and shaved truffles on an onion bun with some really rich black truffle sauce.  \n\nDon't order this burger.  Build your own exactly like it minus the black truffles.  The price goes down to $30.  And you can't really taste the black truffles all that much anyway, especially when the sauce is potent enough of truffle and you don't want to drown out the umami of the foie anyway.\n\nSkinny fries are the best.  I usually order them with a sampler of sauces.  They have about 10 different gourmet sauces like spicy ketchup and truffle mayo, etc...\n\nBest burger I have ever had...and the most expensive.  \n\nGive it a try ;)"
4,"I came with friends 3 times before we were able to get in without waiting an hour. The line is out the door and taxis are shuttling tourists from the strip non-stop.\n\nFood was good, don't get me wrong. But waiting an hour for a burger? The food wasn't anything that blew my mind, but it was good. French fries were very good, I enjoyed them more than my burger."
4,"Time to finish up this review...LOL..Came here on opening day and the wait wasn't so bad. The hostess checks us in on an iPad and texts us when our table is ready. The whole service experience was so welcoming, professional and friendly.  But lets get to the important part! The food :) I ordered the Hells kitchen burger; Full of flavor with a spicy kick...I found my new favorite burger! I come to Vegas every other weekend and stop by here when it's not so packed =)"
4,"My husband and I ate here while on a business trip and just loved everything about it.  Before 9 I though AJ Maxwell in New York had the best  steak and seafood.  My salmon was the best prepared salmon I have EVER had in my life in a restaurant.  My husband loved his steak.\n\nMy lobster mash potatoes was amazing.  The complimentary sample dish sent out was fabulous (can't remember what is was called). \n\nThe crowd was a fun mix of the hip and young, older and chic, entertainment and sports crowd and after hours business type.  Music was nice and loud.\n\nThe prices were a bit high, but I would spend all over again because the service was great and the food was yummy!"
4,"I love going to BWW.  $2 Stella on Thursdays and wings that are actually spicy.  Definitively worth the price.  \n\nThis place has a great view of a TV from almost every seat, and there are a lot of places to sit.  I've taken clients here for lunch and I've never had a bad experience with a server.  They may not always be fast, but I've never thought they were slow."
4,try the sesame chicken or mixed vegetables w fried tofu- ask for it spicy. the owners are very nice too.
4,"OUT OF TOWNERS BEWARE! I am staying at Mandalay Bay and telephone ordered a pizza and garlic knots for delivery from Biaggio's. NO mention was made of ANY delivery charge but a $6.00 \""Strip Delivery Charge\"" was included when the pizza was delivered. To add insult to injury they omitted the garlic knots. The only saving grace, and perhaps most important, the pizza was very good.\n\nUPDATE: About 30 minutes after I posted this review I got a call from Biaggio's apologizing for my \""experience\"" AND removing any and all charges. Even tho I said he should charge me for the GOOD pizza he said he wouldn't do that. Talk about making things right and then some! I had originally rated my experience 3 stars because of the overall experience. Based on the totally positive attitude Biaggo has displayed, not because of any refund, I'm upgrading my star rating. Yay, I am indeed a fan! Terrific response by a business."
4,"awesome food.\none of a good dining experience with excellent service.\nthe food is a tad salty for my taste, I wish they use more natural ingredient other than Salt.\npresentation was great and cooked my filet to perfection. the meat on the other hand, had a few gristle. :( that seems awful..\nI would try a different meat dishes, but they should monitor their steak quality.."
4,"I was there yesterday with a coworker around 4:30pm and luckily there was not a line to get in nor was it crazy busy so we were able to take it all in and talk to the workers there.  We learned so much about how the show is filmed and whatnot and it was too bad we were there so late, we could've been extras on the show since they actually did film things that day.  I was told the guys work there M-F from 9am-3pm but mainly stay in the back so as to not be hounded by the thousands of gawkers that come daily like myself.  So, if you want to be on TV, you had bring something worthy to be shown on TV and be charming enough to get through their weeding process or get there early enough to be extra if you are lucky enough to be there on a day they are shooting.  They had a fair amount of touristy things, and I don't care...I got myself a pawn stars t-shirt...and proud of it.  They didn't have a huge store, but i still enjoyed all the great memorabilia and even got to hear some of the stories about how they obtained said treasures just like if i was watching the show at home.  What a great experience and would recommend to any Pawn Stars fan!"
4,"Good Pizza for Arizona. They have a great lunch special, 2 slices and a drink for $5 including tax. If you are looking for good pizza in the Scottsdale area come by an"
4,"We stayed at Venetian in the past and only saw the small Bouchon  to-go bakery on the lower level, I never realized an entire restaurant would be on the upper floor of the hotel!\n\nWe came here for lunch. Got the smoked salmon with cream cheese chive sandwich. This was delicious with some capers intermixed in between. I don't usually like smoked salmon but I though I'd try it here and it was delicious. \n\nsalmon sandwich: \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A?userid=OhFp0SPP5udI9EccfpzQ_g\n\nOthers got the pork belly special which was presented quite nicely. My friend who's been to the Bouchon in Napa says they are comparable in taste.\n\npork belly:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A?select=CrbIl0aP3b-AFMtoK2Vv5w\n\nNoting this down as a restaurant that is worth the revisit to get a pricier entree. (IE: Not something that I later found downstairs at their to-go bakery :(! )\n\nI'm sad I missed out on the macarons which apparently are delicious!"
4,"DELISH!! Very yummy! We were so pleased to find this charming little spot. As others have said, yes, it really is better than the place across the street. The service was great and the fish was tasty. We'll definitely be back!!"
4,"I came here for the Cinnabon because it would appear I can get some of my favorite rolls outside of the mall finally. Being a previous Cinnabon employee, I know what a REAL cinnamon roll from Cinnabon tastes like and what to expect in the perfect roll. Sadly, the rolls here were just par-rated. I guess I expect too much from Cinnabon now, but I really wish Schlotzsky's would hire employees solely for the Cinnabon side of them so I know for certain they are made with as much love as necessary."
4,Nice las vegas club.. If your a chick you get to get in for free and free drinks before 12:30pm.. And guys like us get to pay $30 to get in and struggle at the bar trying to purchase a drink past all the chicks trying to get their free drinks... Lol over all the club is small and tight when filled to capacity.
4,Hubby and I were in Charlotte for the week and prefer vegan restaurants. It was fairly  easy to find off the expressway. It's a cute place. Everything is made from scratch. They offer plenty of GF options. Our wait time was about15 minutes but worth it. It's a tiny place with little seating but were able to eat inside since it was past the lunch rush. No public restroom.
4,Great food & super friendly staff! Older hotel but clean & well kept! A historic gambling site for those who want the old school style treatment.
4,"Why go to a regular sub shop when you've got the Pita Pit? They grill the meat fresh for you, and you can pick out extra ingredients just like you can at most sub shops.\n\nFor some reason, I always like the bright green and orange colors when I come in here. The place feels so alive and bustling, I just can't help but leave happy."
4,Fast and nice to work with!\n\nEveryone here has been so pleasant to work with for all of my at-home projects. I haven't used Copies at Carson for anything professional - but lots of sticker and postcard making! They also print photos.
4,"Really loved Ishi when they were at the old location, because it was cozy and always full. Since they moved they have a bigger place, had to cut costs on certain items but the sushi and hibachi is good and not too expensive. Saki bombs are cun there!"
4,"I missed the Lobster and Steak Day. It moved from Monday MNF to Thursdays. Its Kinda a cool spot to watch MNF. Staff are nice. Food honestly is really good. The Dj Wouldn't play Digital Undergrounds \""Freaks Of the Industry,\"" said it was to slow for time. Free Parking."
4,"I go here before Pens games or shows. Drinks are amazing and so is the food! Sometimes it's hard to get the bartenders attention...sometimes you have to walk around and find her/him. Overall, it's a cool place to come before or after events at Consol."
4,"BEST RICE IN TOWN! I'm not as big on Lebanese food as I am on Persian food but their kafta is still real good.  Their rice is something from heaven, so good I usually order an extra side.  Also, their pita bread is made fresh right when you come in, soooooo nice!  Their service is great and friendly!"
4,"Az 88 is exactly what you want from a modern, new age restaurant. The decor and lighting is unique and really sets the mood for a fun evening in Scottsdale. The menu is fairly big for this type of restaurant and the prices are excellent considering the look and feel of the place would make you think the food would be much pricier. The few items I tried were great and the consensus of our group was that everything was good. The restrooms are awesome just don't be fooled by the mirrors on every wall. I really enjoyed my experience at AZ88 and would definitely consider going again."
4,"My husband and I stopped for lunch last Saturday, we were the only people in the whole place.  The waiter was so friendly. The bread and dip was amazing. We both ordered the chicken bacon sandwich with tortellini salad they was fantastic. The tortellini salad is such a nice change for a side option.  The lunch prices and sizes were perfect.  We felt perfectly full but not weighed down.  It would have been 5 stars if only they had a better outside area."
4,"Saw this place reviewed by Guy on Diners, drive ins and Dives and thought we would try it and see what we thought! We pulled up and the line was about 30 deep but when we saw how fast it was moving we thought it wouldn't take long. It was worth the wait in line after we ordered they gave us a pager and within 15 minutes we had fresh amazing home made food and plenty of seating inside and out. We had breakfast and all I can say is pancakes the size of your head with home made sausage and potato fries. Oh and did I mention the home made lemonade and cheesecake. Great place we will be back"
4,"Honestly, it's pretty unassuming from the outside. Inside it's a tiny greek diner, albeit some \""Americanized\"" choices on the menu. Hello buffalo chicken gyro!\n\nBut if you are craving for a fixin' of some stuffed cabbage, potato pierogies, or halushki, this is your place. And for dirt cheap too. I think our total bill was like $10. \n\nObviously you'll get the traditional gyro's here as well, with the twist of the buffalo chicken one. Obviously, I'm intrigued. They also sell ice cream, which if I wasn't so full from my meal, I definitely would have indulged in!"
4,"I attended a wedding reception here and it was a great facility for a dinner event.  Of course, the facility was beautiful  and staff was friendly. The food was pretty good.   The layout was perfect for an event like this -  there was plenty of room for lots of large dinner tables as well as a dance floor.  They kept the beverage stations open and well stocked.  The bride and groom were very pleased and the guests had a great time."
4,"Spent an amazing afternoon at the Phoenix zoo.   The weather was perfect and it wasn't overly crowded.   The animals musta missed the memo announcing our arrival as most were sleeping but they were at least sleeping out where you could see them.  \n\nExtras are a bit pricey but overall it was a great way to spend the afternoon outside, enjoying the wonderful fall weather."
4,"Very good experience. They had a wonderfully attentive wait staff (on a Saturday night no less). My meal was excellent (beef burgundy). My fianc\u00e9's steak was rather undercooked even after we sent it back (hence the one star ding), but it was still quite good and that is really my only complaint. \nIt strikes me as a solid date night / special occasion kind of restaurant."
4,Never in my life have I seen this much memorabilia in one place. It's like walking through Gene Summons' office if he were an M&M.\n\nSo many things from dolls-candy machines and bottles-toys and of course lots and lots of the small flat chocolate circles we all know as M&M's.\n\nThis is a must see for tourist who love chocolate. There are so many things to see. Not just to buy but to look at. Simply amazing.\n\nI had a ball. Or several hundred flat chocolate circles.
4,"R n R is beautiful, I just love the architectural features.. delicious before you even step inside the door! They have two floors of inside/outside seating, tons of waiters/bartenders and usually great music.Saturday/Sunday afternoons they usually have it loud!! (Which I like).  \n\nI like this place because you could bring your mom for lunch or your boyfriend for late night. They have all kinds of appetizers. I would say the flavor is mainly American with a twist. I've had the \""animal fries\"" and they are delicious, also the nachos are good and the sliders.. Actually I have to say all the food I have tried has been good. For the portions it does seem like a medium priced place in comparison to other spots that are fancier (Herb Box and Bandera). I have sat inside, and on both floors of the outdoor patios. The decor is very nice, and overall I really like this place and plan to come back."
4,one of the best buffets i have ever been too. they have everything there. EVERYTHING. the only thing thats holding it back from getting 5 stars is that the line to get in is ridiculous and it is pretty pricey... but it is what it is i guess. if your ever in vegas you should try this buffet out at some point
4,"A great \""locals\"" joint in Vegas.  Awesome breakfast place...plus they have a yelp offer if you check in.  How awesome is that?  Overall great food and great experience.  If you go on the weekend...be prepared for a line!"
4,$1 MOVIE TUESDAYS!!!! $1.50 MOVIES EVERY OTHER DAY.... :-) the seats don't move back but then again who cares when the movie Is only  $1.50!!!!! Looking to take someone on a cheap date?? BRING THEM HERE!
4,"Ahhhh L'Appartement! J'y deviendrais locataire demain matin...J'y suis retourner pour une 3i\u00e8me fois et l'exp\u00e9rience y fut une encore tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able. L'ambiance est d\u00e9contract\u00e9 sans \u00eatre trop bruyante, les fen\u00eatres y laissait entrer une lumi\u00e8re chaleureuse et le service, encore une fois imp\u00e9ccable et sympathique.

4,"CHRISTMAS FESTIVAL. From an adult's perspective, this would be 2 or 3 stars, but from the kid's viewpoint it's a 4.\n \n If I had not gone on a groupon deal, I would  have felt ripped off. On the positive side, my niece and nephew had a really good time. They're only 6 and 3, so they did not have high expectations. We were there for 3 hours, so we definitely got our money's worth. But a lot of that was us just playing the games -- ring toss, bean bag toss -- so I guess you could say that we made our own fun.\n\nI'd never been, so when I read \""hay ride\"" and \""train ride,\"" I expected something a little longer than a loop through the desert. The \""train\"" is actually a tractor pulling cars, and it took the exact same loop through the desert as the hay ride. Granted, after night fell, the loop was different in that there were lights on the train and lighted displays along the course. They looked pretty and the kids enjoyed them.\n\nThe petting zoo could have used a better clean up from the recent rains. Most of the animals were docile, but one of the donkeys tried to kick the worker who was supervising the zoo. We were warned to stay away from him and from a largish pig who was antisocial.\n\nEveryone was friendly and helpful.\n\nNext year I think we'll do zoo lights."
4,"It's easy to see why this small eatery is so popular: the food is inexpensive and tasty, the servings are more than ample, and the range of choices run the gamut of popular Asian cooking styes: Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Mongolian. It's great to be able to order tonkatsu, pad thai, and General Tsao all in one place. While the place could use more light and perhaps a bit of touching up, you come here for the inexpensive, delicious food and not for the decor. I noticed while dining here that they have a very brisk take-out business so don't be surprised if there's a bit of a delay in getting your food if you dine here at peak hours."
4,Very good.... The stone crab wasn't quite as good as I remember the original in miami and my steak was a bit over salted. But overall everyone in our party of 8 was very pleased w their meal
4,"What a neat concept for kids and adults.  I was impressed by the size of the place, by the genuine politeness of the staff, and by the overall cleanliness.  My granddaughter has had an amazing time whenever we bring her.  It's not cheap, but it they have deals every so often.\n\nOur complaint is with the snack bar.  Prices are very fair,  but the yogurt bar (which consumes most of the space of that snack bar) is just gross.  The yogurt itself was not made correctly and was very sour.  The toppings were stale and nasty.  Stick to the Dasani bottled water and the stiff pizza and you'll be okay."
4,Great place to stay. This was the best lodging I have had since traveling to Las Vegas for business. Large rooms that are more like a suite than a hotel room. There was no smell of smoke in the room or casino. \n\nThe only complaint would be the wind whistle from the window that sounded like a haunted house sound track.
4,"Brunch Buffet is great. Service is kind of spotty, but the food - for a buffet - is awesome. But it is still a buffet, people. Is it amazing compared to every other buffet on the planet? Yes. It is amazing compared to a sit down restaurant where everything is made fresh to order? \n\nNo, so don't expect that. Instead, sit down, unfasten your belt, and gorge until you enter a coma. Boom."
4,"tucked away in a little corner waaaaay away from the strip (just off asian central on spring mountain) we found this cute little bakery. they don't have an extensive selection of breads, but what they do carry is definitely freshly baked and fluffy and light and soft. their roll cakes are also pretty dang good, annnnd they have japanese castella (honey roll) and puddings."
4,"Great food and nice atmosphere! It was very expensive, considering what we got, but it's in Las Vegas on the Strip, so I wouldn't really expect anything less.\n\nWait staff was all very kind and made good suggestions for my partner who is allergic to gluten and dairy. Not everyone is as understanding.\n\nPresentation of the food was very nice and their selection of teas was also surprisingly good. Not just the usual one choice that most restaurants give you!"
4,"Had a wonderful time at St. Francis last week.  The service was very attentive.  The architectural detail of this place makes it worth the visit for that alone.  Ask for a tour of the details, they love sharing it with you.\n\nCan't wait to get back there again as the menu expands and it is open more hours. \n\nWarning though:  it isn't inexpensive."
4,"The wife and I got a room here for fifty or so dollars a night on Priceline and really enjoyed ourselves. Our room had a sliding glass door facing the pool, a very nice pool, and we could just walk out of our room straight into the water... nice. Our room was nice with a comfy bed and modern design, plus there's no parking fee and it right by Scottsdale Fashion. I would have no problem staying here again for a little getaway, I would always prefer Valley Ho, but if the money isn't there this is my second choice for sure."
4,"I like this airport. I've been stuck here many a-times between domestic and international layovers.  The layout is pretty easy to understand - you do have to walk a lot between terminals so wear comfy shoes and have good wheels on your suitcase.  Most if not all the terminals are connected via walking so you don't need to catch a shuttle. However this means you are walking a lot - as I said above.\n\nThe main hub area that connects a lot of the terminals together has a good selection of restaurants.  I've hung out there a few times - once during my layover in 2005 from Nicaragua where I watched the Superbowl at a Chili's or something similar.  There are definitely a few vegan options around for food.\n\nThere are some good stores for shopping too if you have more time to kill after that first or second Bloody Mary.\n\nIt's not the best airport but it's pretty good as far as navigation, food quality and choices, and cleanliness goes."
4,"OK, so it's not the *best* BBQ I have ever had, but when you live in San Francisco (where there's a huge gaping lack of good BBQ), then this will seriously work. The portions are huge, the food is tasty, service is friendly, and the prices are reasonable. If you want a no frills, down home BBQ in Las Vegas - go have you some Buzz!"
4,Really comfortable seating! And you can bring in delicious wood fired pizza from Five50 Pizza Bar that right around the corner.
4,"There were some dishes on the menu that were good and some were ok the drinks were great however with vodka and pomegranate. Kimchi fried was good although there is a similar dish at ichiza that is priced less and taste about the same. I expected the quality to bet better than that of ichiza. The salmon  i got had miso which tasted good, the only issue I have was the price."
4,"The first thing I noticed about this place was that it was so  . . . anti-Scottsdale. Gone were the snobby hostesses and contemporary deco; in their place an undersized tiki bar with tacky neon beer signs illuminating the reeded wall coverings. And rather than the break-beat/techno that Ra and Stingray have made the sushi bar standard, Ichiban was rockin' bad '80's tunes. Like, really bad. If there were an XM station for VH1's \""Awesomely Bad\"" series, we've found it, and it's on rotation at Ichiban.\n\nThe sushi is clever and inventive, with specialty rolls incorporating anything from jalapenos to mexican tortillas. My personal fave is the Chimichanga roll, basically a philly roll with avocado -- flash fried. Unfortunately, the quickest way to my heart is my arteries. There's a fantasmic happy hour from 5-7pm every night with $4 Cali rolls and dirt-cheap sake, and if you sit at the bar you can watch the owner (who personally prepares every specialty roll served) and you're guaranteed an entertaining show. The only downside is if you're not there by seven sharp, you don't escape quite as \""happy\"" with your bill as you might have been.\n\n \""We Built this City\"" almost got it a fifth star, but not quite."
4,I had lunch here on Saturday and it was very good. I have had filipino food but am far from an expert. Very tasty and extremely well priced. This is a stickly casual place with limited seating but they do a good carry out business and the turn over is very good. I had the goat and chicken entrees with rice. Also potatoes on a skewer coated in brown sugar and several other items including squid. If you are in the area I do recommend you stop in..
4,"Went for my 21st birthday, got upgraded to a forum tower suite 23rd floor overlooking the pools. 2 bathrooms with an entrance to a double shower headed shower in each bathroom. Huge tub, tons of mirrors and closet space. Beautiful room, within walking distance of the best hotels. Had the time of my life."
4,"Much shorter wait time in the front waiting room compared to the main, general spine clinic just around the corner in the medical complex.\n\nThe best aspect of this surgical facility is the short wait before being sent back for pre-operation surgical procedure.  The wait time is significantly shorter, which is a welcome change.\n\nIt is also a surgical medical facility, so more standard procedure that is more common in what I assume is the typical surgery centers. But at all times, I felt at ease and in good hands at the care of all the experienced nurses and surgical staff.\n\nWhile waiting, they play movies so you and your ride is as entertained and least bored as possible.\n\n4 stars."
4,"Very cool place downtown in CityScape, love the idea, not your dad's bowling alley full of sweaty old men playing in league's. This is definitely built more around the lounge concept than bowling lanes. A great place to have a b-day party with friends, they have huge screens at the end of each lane that were playing college football games when we went. They stocked local brew from Four Peaks which is awesome.\n\nThe downside is the service wasn't the best but this is a new location so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that they will figure it out. Other than that we highly recommend checking it out, once CityScape is done it's gonna be great to hangout downtown."
4,"I've been going to Culinary Dropout at least once a month--sometimes more often--since it opened at the Yard. Love the food...so many dishes I enjoy, esp the bistro steak, Korean style steak, salmon, meatloaf, ribs.  Nice small menu, good for brunches, good beer and wine selections"
4,"I ate at Tratorria del Lupo in Mandalay a year or so ago and loved it.  I had the Ragu ala Bolgnese which was a delight. Just the right mix of meat and tomato and pasta make the dish a rich and satisfying meal.  We paired our meal with Bellinis - a peachy/sparkling wine mix that is light and refreshing!  The restaurant has a classic Italian decor, but the best part is the an open patio within Mandalay's restaurant row (inside).  Sit on the patio for great people watching!  We spent a couple hours on a Friday night watching increasingly intoxicated clubbers wobble along walkways and make to the trendy clubs that are nearby.  It was bit on the pricey side, but a worthwhile experience for your tastebuds!"
4,"Convenient to ASU, friendly service, simple warm ambiance, and pretty decent Thai food. I've had AMAZING spicy Pad Thai here and then the next time it was only so-so, so the consistency is a bit hard to predict. I really like that they offer different levels of spiciness for their menu options (personally, medium doesn't seem spicy at all to me). I enjoy the fried tofu with sweet and spicy sauce, the papaya salad (order it spicy!), the Pad Prik King (green beans, carrots and lemon leaves stir-fried with your protein of choice), and either the Pad Thai or the Pad Woon Sen (glass noodles). Service has always been extremely nice and prompt."
4,"I was really impressed about this place. Most of the girls are really hot. The lap dances are off the chain. They are fully nude, too; and you can touch. Also, they lie you down on this bed. If you could drink in this club, it would of got 5 stars. No question.  The lap dances make this club, though."
4,"Was visiting from out of town when I stumbled across this little oasis in the desert.  Upon entry I immediately felt like I walked into the Batcave.  It's dark in here!  After feeling my way around the store, and squinting through the decent amount of current and back issues, I picked up a few comics and headed for the light.  I downloaded a flashlight app on my phone, so I'm all set for the next time I visit."
4,"The simple awesomeness of penguins, monkeys and a kapibara in Canada warrants a visit to the Biodome.\n\n90 minutes or two hours strolling through the Biodome's ecosystems are time well spent indeed. The relative freedom of the animals to roam their pavilion is a great change from zoo cages, and you can play monkey-spotting or admire the beautiful macaws, knowing too well you can't own one because it would out-live you.\n\nTry to avoid school holidays and weekends if possible. You don't want the place to be bustling with hyperactive kids having a great time. You also definitely want a spot for sitting in the penguin section and a view on the swimming penguins, without a crowd of munchkins obstructing the water line.\n\nAdmission is steep if you aren't a Quebecer or a student. Definitely worth a visit though. If you bundle the Biodome with the Botanical Garden the deal gets better.\n\nDo not do the Olympic tower. You get a better view from the Mont Royal chalet. It is free and involves a healthy trek up the hill."
4,"I have a tendency to always come for happy hour - everyday 5-8pm and 12pm-close. It's awesome because you can get a steak and one side for half off! Even though its happy hour, the quality of the food doesn't go down. The atmosphere inside is very reminiscent of an old Western movie. Make sure to get a mint julep! It's really strong and one usually does the trick for me. Just make sure to make a reservation before you go to avoid waiting if you're going for happy hour. There was this one time I went around 650-7 but wasn't seated til 8ish and got charged full price, because we ordered after 8."
4,"The restaurant inside the Phoenix Art Museum is great!  Lovely set-up, wonderful ingredients and combinations (affiliated with the Farm at South Mountain), pleasant and attentive staff, and reasonable prices - all in all, the best museum restarant I've been to!\n\nWe stopped in for some drinks and an appetizer between exhibits and were so pleasasantly surprised by food quality (without the inflated prices that usually come with being a captive audience), warm service and atmosphere and we actually planned to come hungry on our next museum visit.  \n\nThe food around us looked yummy: the sandwiches have great-looking ingredients, the crab cakes look marvelous and have barely any filling (per the server), and the coconut cake is a delightfully generous portion. To top it all off, they have named the menu items to go with their Hollywood Costume theme - hilarious!!"
4,"*Crying* I actually really like Zipps. I went there quite often during the March Madness.\n\nThey just opened and I haven't really had any of the bad service that others have described. I've opened or helped open various restaurants and every place is going to have growing/opening pains. That is just how it is! I wouldn't give up on it quite yet folks. If the other Zipps around the valley are of any indication, then they will shape up soon."
4,"First time here was on a Tuesday morning around 10:30.  I've always heard this place was busy so I thought we'd be good at this time.  We were able to be seated right away but I was still amazed on how many people were there for breakfast at this hour.  Atmosphere was a little noisy but service was quick.  The coffee was just right for my liking, and I had the scrambled eggs with salami with side of hash browns and wheat toast.  I had actually ordered the home fries but got hash browns, which was perfectly ok because they were amazing.  The strawberry jam was fantastic as well.  I'll be going back."
4,I have been coming here every month for 5 years to see the same technician. I would never go anywhere else.
4,"I'm sorry this review is about to be so short. Literally my favourite place to get a bacon-covered cinnamon roll in the city. Ask nicely (pay extra) and they will put a fried egg on it. AHAHAHHA I KNOW I'M A MAD GENIOUS. Bam, crushfast (more extreme than breakfast) of champions. \n\nNOTE: Prices could be better."
4,"Bottle sevice+Kaskade+group of ER nurses = i'm a happy camper\n\nI'm definitely coming back to this club again. I only have a few complaint about this place and that is rude bouncers!!!! They're very strict when it comes to trying to keep people moving in aisle. They don't want people standing around the aisle when there's a performance going on. If you don't' have a table reserved, good luck trying to  get a peek of who's playing that night. The bouncers don't care if ur a female , if you're in the way they'll shove u away.\n\nThey also try to make this club exclusive, so they'll pick on petty things such as not wearing ur shoe in the club, hotel, elevator or anywhere on their property ( WTEFF? Most of us just danced the night away in ur effing club with our high heels on..give us females a break!) They'll kick your friends out of the club if they remotely look drunk even though theyre allready on their way out and hasn't made a scene (for ex: like throwing up at some random person's shoe, falling in the pool).\n\nAside from the neg things I'll still give this club 4 stars for the music, atmosphere, awesome lineup of performers!"
4,"3.5 stars, but they get 4 from me since the grilled chicken was super juicy!\n\nMy friends and I came here around 9:30pm to grab dinner before clubbing. It took about 10 minutes to be seated, which wasn't bad considering it was extremely packed. It took awhile for our food to arrive, so this may not be the place to dine if you are in a hurry to get somewhere.\n\nWe saw how large the portions were, so my friend and I shared the Pasta with Grilled Chicken, Tomato, Basil & Mozzarella. The grilled chicken wasn't dry at all. I was surprised at how juicy it was considering it was white meat! I couldn't finish even though we shared. Definitely kept me full the rest of the night.\n\nYelp reviews said this was the sister restaurant of The Cheesecake Factory, so we kept comparing the two. I think I like this one better! We saw the next table's Shrimp Scampi and that looked absolutely delicious! Dine here if you want good quality and portions for the price!"
4,"I sure am glad my roommate told me to check this place out. Kristen and I stopped by RnR the other day for a late lunch and happened to get there just in time for happy hour, my beer was less than her tea, awesome. I love the look of the place, the front door is huge and sweet, and while the inside is on the smaller side, it doesn't feel packed, and there is ample seating outside, I can't wait for the cooler weather so we can stop by more often and people watch. \n    We started with two appetizers, the pigs in a blanket, which are the old childhood favorite with a light and flaky pastry crust, they were delicious, and the chicken lollipops, super tender on the bone chicken with buffalo sauce, so stinking good. We then shared the pork sandwich, which had a sweet and tangy sauce that complimented the tender pork wonderfully, it was a terrific sandwich and came with a bucket of fries. \n    With crazy hours, good drink selections and a great happy hour, RnR is definitely worth checking out, I wish I had came here sooner."
4,"yes!  this is the closest thing to a real mall I've found in Vegas.  crappy stores, arcade and good people watching.  love it! lots of neat things you want but can't justify buying.  nothings too overpriced when compared to other shopping on the strip. one day I promise myself ill buy that oversized painted fan for the living room, or that set of throwing knives. pretty fun place to waste time if your sick of loosing at slots..."
4,I am commenting on the super Bi-lo in Matthews on Fincher Farm lane.  The managers and sales staff are quite friendly and do go out of their way to assist you. They recently overcharged me on an item that was still advertised as buy one get one free but they made good and refunded all the  money plus I got to keep the item. Can't complain about that. I wish they did offer more gourmet items as Harris Teeter does but I like the shopping experience there and they do have good deals on lots of items that I buy frequently. That is why I keep going back.
4,"Dined with 14 for business. Eclectic menu with several very high end entrees including Kobe beef and geoduck, but you could get away with 30 ish per person if you were on a budget. We had a tri plate appetizer of various poultry cuts which were loved by all. A group of us shared the Kobe, a fried rice and a fish dish. All were very good. Service was Asian-reflective gracious with several managers mindfully keeping an eye on a bevy of effective staff. We had a birthday cake brough in from a 3rd party for a surprise and it went off flawlessly. I give 5 stars under only the most phenomenal circumstances so please don't take the 4 star as a repudiation. I would certainly recommend."
4,"Chen's, probably the best Chinese food on campus. \n\nI usually order the chicken shanghai noodles which is quite good. It's probably the sauce they put in it , but it keeps bringing me back. For plaza food, its also a decent price of around $8 for a good amount of food. \n\nThey also have free bubble tea after 5pm - it's not the greatest but hey, it's free."
4,"We just made our first visit to this year old spot in Middleton, after a great recommendation from friends, and while mourning the loss of Casa Bianca, Madison's closest approximation of NY-style pizza. Madison is not a great pizza town --local Wisconsin cheese lacks the tang of Boston's Regina's or the great New Haven apizza spots, and the corporate Uno's lacks the distinctive pizazz of the Chicago original (we prefer Due's) and its best Chicago competitors (e.g., Lou Malnati's). Given all that, Villa Dolce was a very pleasant surprise. Crusts were excellent, and the imaginative toppings (we are veggie types on our pizza choices) were exceptionally fresh and tasty. In our view, Villa Dolce is a strong competitor for best (upscale) pizza in Madison. We'll make a few more visits before coming to a final decision on that...\nThe gelato we sampled was superb--intense, delicious and distinctive taste and excellent consistency. I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about.\nWe strongly disagree with another reviewer's comment on service. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic without being overly intrusive. Her recommendations were on the mark, and she suggested favorites we might try on future visits.\nThe seating and environment were comfortable and very pleasant, with seasonal outdoor seating as well. More cafe -like than other pizza places in town.\nAll in all, a winner. We'll reserve a fifth star pending additional visits."
4,"I give it 4 stars because it's cheap and their pizzas are huge!  Biggest medium pizza I've seen.  The pizzas themselves seemed pretty basic/standard in terms of quality, nothing special.  Service was acceptable."
4,"I finally checked out the new Mint since I was attending the YAM's Black & White gala.  I was  impressed with the new space as well as the party that the YAMs put together.\n\nThe museum itself is modern, open, and quite large.  My favorite exhibit on this visit was the Romare Bearden collection.  It is quite extensive and there are a lot of great pieces. \n\nBack in the day (10-15 years ago) I was a YAM (Young Affliliate of the Mint).  As a YAM, I  attended a lot of special events at the old Mint of Craft & Design (in the old Montaldo's building) as well as lots of events at the Randolph Mint.  This venue is larger and better equipped to handle special events and parties than the old Mint of Craft & Design.  \n\nThe food, drinks, and music at the Gala were all quite good. Can't wait to go back for another event at the Mint, or just to spend an afternoon wandering through the galleries again."
4,"Great service and food.  The only reason I did not give it five stars was I ordered the chicken soup to go, and the description on the menu says it has snow peas in the soup, but when I got it home no peas :(   But that is just one minor error.  Truthfully this place has REALLY good tacos, chips, guacamole, entrees, etc. that you can't help but love this place.  We are already planning on going there again soon.  And for anyone reading reviews of mexican food places on 7th street - all I can say is stay away from Gadzooks on 7th street and venture down the road a little to this gem of a restaurant.  It's worth the drive."
4,Great experience! Service was excellent and we sat at the bar. Had the Jalape\u00f1o popper burger my date had the Dynamic Duo and we shared the King roll. Sushi roll was good size. Very tasty. We couldn't finish our burgers. Can't  wait to come back everything looked and sounded good.
4,"Love to stop here! This is a great place to have a drink and relax! Except for the main bar, all of the seating is outside with misters in the summer and heaters in the winter.  \n\nThe bartenders are friendly. They pour a good drink. Food is available. \n\nYes, it's a biker bar, but very laid back. Be it locals or out-of-towners, all are welcome here."
4,"The place is great for some drinks after work.  It has a great bar.  I love to sit at bars.  The back outdoor patio has a great atmosphere with glassed in fireplaces and lots of seating.  If you want to play some games they have bocce ball.  I went with my husband and we were sitting at a table and just kind of looking at each other like \""ok so what do we talk about now\"".  Low and behold there were some trivia pursuit cards on the table.  We made up our own rules \""Ok if you ask a question I can't answer I get to ask you for another question one time\"".  We had so much fun.  I think it's a wonderful place to frequent.  The food is wonderful and it's a great place to meet your friends."
4,"This is one of our favorite stops in Las Vegas. Great food, shops and sightseeing. I recommend at least a passing visit."
4,Stopped by after a quick trip to Bass Pro and ordered a ton of food to take to our hotel. First timer and I like it. We ordered 20 of the meat tacos and several street tacos. The street tacos ain't as good as the taco trucks in Hawaii but it was delicious. The workers here were pleasant. I'd return!
4,"Great happy hour.\n\nThis place makes me miss my old neighborhood. My husband and I used to go during happy hour and order tons of food and drinks and get out of there under $30. Our rotation of munchies includes potato skins (sans bacon), hummus, wings, fried mozzarella, and ALWAYS fried pickles. Their fried pickles are soooo good. If you like pickles and fried food, you will LOVE their fried pickles.\n\nLarge drafts and wells are reasonably priced. Their bloody marys are probably my favorite in the valley. Ask for a cajun rim!\n\nService is usually good."
4,The service here was a little slow. The restaurant was clean and the atmosphere was pretty nice. The food was very tasty. The hamburger here was good and I was pretty impressed. The bread they give you is addicting and you will keep wanting more. The pasta here was also above average and I would recommend it. The price was little high then most but not by much.
4,"Mekong Supermarket is impressively clean and organized.  I could walk through the store without tripping over product containers and without the overwhelming smell of dried shrimp.  I was also impressed with the layout and condition of the live/frozen seafood section.  The frozen case was extremely organized and the product descriptions were visible and easy to read.  The live seafood tanks were full and appeared to be well maintained.  As for the prices, they were very reasonable and lower compared to other markets.  We had specific weight requirements for our seafood so we were a little high maintenance for the staff but they were willing to accommodate to the best of their ability. Our selection for the day was a live lobster, tilapia and catfish. All needed to be no greater than 2lbs which we approximately met with the help of the staff.  Our tilapia and catfish were cleaned and bagged while our lobster traveled live with us over to Asian Caf\u00e9 Express where we had our seafood selection prepared for our meal.  Mekong and ACE have an agreement that allows customers to select their seafood product then ACE will prepare it to a selected style for a small fee. This was a first and enjoyable experience for me. Something I would do again - most definitely."
4,"This is a pretty nice little cafe that's close to the Museum of Fine Arts. The food is decent (we had brunch on a Sunday morning) and the drinks were good too. It's a bit fancier than a normal cafe, so dressing a bit nicer is probably the norm here. The staff was very nice and service was prompt. As a heads up, it's also a bit pricier than some of the other cafes around Montreal, so be prepared when you come here. Overall though, it's a nice place and a good place to stop if you're heading over to the art museum."
4,"The poor drive thru window teller was getting yelled at by the tube customer and still managed to keep her cool and help me with my deposit. Susan was incredibly composed, and did her very best to be patient and polite, despite obviously being flustered. Be kind to these people!"
4,"Casual atmosphere and great food. What more could you ask for on a weeknight in Uptown? The crowd here is laid back and unpretentious, and the servers here are friendly and welcoming. The menu offers a great selection, from traditional items like wings and wraps, and even pizza. Dare I say it: this may be the best pizza I've had in Charlotte so far! Level with me here - it's not phenomenal, and it's no NY slice, but it's pretty good for Charlotte! I had the spinach and sun dried tomato small pie. It's not crispy, but it's doughy and yummy - I'll take it. We also had the honey chipolte wings which were spicy and delicious. Only minor issue here was that our server, who was the bartender, kept forgetting to put our wings in and it took us forever to get them. But he was so cool and funny that we didn't really care much, and it actually became funny after a while even though we were starving. \n\nPicasso's is large in size and as I mentioned, draws a great crowd. We were here on a Tuesday night and it was packed. There is a big leather couch right in the middle of it to lounge on and you are surrounded by TV's no matter where you sit. Head on over for some great food and relaxation!"
4,Even tho I chipped a tooth on bacon... the food was so tasty...\n\nWe went to the location at the M hotel....
4,Terrific service in a comfortable environment and delicious Venezuelan food at a fair price.  Looking forward to a second visit... I wonder why more restaurant managers aren't this excited about their food?
4,"The Yummy:\nGood prices, friendly staff, fresh selection, bright & spacious atmosphere, parking spots reserved for hybrids (eco-friendly store)\n\nThe Yucky:\nBe careful when shopping for the near-expired food. Even though they're 50% off, some things are better left uneaten."
4,"This was one of the first places I ate at when I moved to Phoenix.  It was so good, I took my husband for dinner the next night.  Great food and atmosphere.  Love the outdoor seating.  Great staff as well!"
4,"Dinner at Bouchon was wonderful..I had the chicken dish and it was amazing, the dessert...brownie shaped wine corks are very good as well. I like the upscale but bistro ambiance. The food was comfort french with unique twists. Overall a very delicious meal, but for the price I might try somewhere else next time before heading back."
4,"Where have I been?  When did Carl's Jr go upscale?  Maybe I should have seen it with their $6000 combo (The commercial that says it's served only at the Palms - and staring the Maloof Brothers?) or maybe their $6.00 burger.  \n\nIn running some errands it was suggested that we eat here.  Not grab here or drive through here, but eat here.  I think I'd eaten inside a Carl's Jr maybe once before in my life.  \n\nIt's actually decent inside here.  There were 3 different TV's around the place, at the time all tuned on a different one of the ESPN channels.  I got this big Chicken salad for $6 and was shocked when it came out quite big.  And actually good.  And I was washing it down with a Squirt.  As I'm eating my salad, a girl there came over to see if I'd like a refill.  Are you serious?  I said no, but my companion said yes.  We had our drinks filled another time after that.  At the end, I wasn't sure if we were supposed to tip or not.  We left a buck just in case though we didn't see anyone else doing the same.  \n\nI didn't check out their nutritional info to know if it was actually healthy or if it just felt healthy - but it sure was a nice option to have vs. another burger or taco place."
4,"First of all, food here is really really cheap and they don't scrimp on the portions either. This is the place where you want to come when you're down on chips but still want to have some chicken rice. Food is not the best, but they certainly make it up for its affordable price and portion"
4,"The only thing that sucks about this place is that they DON'T have a location in Boston!!  Lol!  I came here for vaca in March and we literally came here 3 times for breakfast!!  \n\nThey have out of this world BLT bloody mary's and yes it is exactly what you are picturing!  Bloody mary rimmed with crushed up bacon, garnished with a slice of lettuce, tomato, and a slice of bacon, with a piece of white toast on the side for dipping!  My thoughts exactly!!!  It even came out on its own plate!\n\nWe were pretty overwhelmed with the menu because we wanted EVERYTHING on it!  A friend and I decided to share some things so we could try a little of it all.  First up, the Snickers pancake, yes just one, but that is all you need as it is 12 inches wide!  It was heavenly delicious!  Second, we got the Fried Chicken and Waffles (which were infused with slices of bacon).  Heart attack on a plate, YES!  But well worth it!  Lastly, the Hash dish with grilled chicken, asparagus, and sundried tomatoes atop homestyle potatoes with 2 eggs, and a fresh biscuit!  A bit on the healthy side compared to everything else, but fresh and tasty none the less!  The marmalade that came with the biscuit made it.  \n\nDefinitely make this stop a must on your Vegas vacation!!"
4,I really like this place for sushi. They have the option to have sushi rolls with brown rice instead of white. and every roll ive had there has been amazing. I really like the set up of the place as well.
4,I ordered the Eggs Benedict at Wanda's and it was very flavorful. The downside was that the egg was fried and no poached. The service was very good and the people were friendly! Definitely a place worth checking out. I was referred by someone from the DMV.
4,"I don't get my fro yo fix until June in chilly Chicago so I jumped at a visit to Yogurtland during my recent visit to Phoenix.  \n\nThis is when of those pay by the ounce places. After sampling about 5 different types of yogurt I decided on 1/2 peanut butter and 1/2 devils food.  Since they claim to be low-fat it seemed like a healthy option until I loaded it with reeses and all sort of other candy that made it extra delish. Can never go wrong with peanut butter flavored anything- especially when you load on the extra reeses!\n\nMy colleagues and I weren't the only ones with fro yo on our minds because Yogurtland was quite busy. And with tasty flavors, an impressive selection of toppings and affordable pricing I can sure see why!"
4,"Gurkha Brigade is not the most obvious eatery on Leith Walk, but is certainly not the worst.  It's predominantly a restaurant with plenty of clean and spaciously laid out table with a clean and friendly environment.  I went for their takeaway menu which, although quite expensive in comparison to other place in the area, was varied with plenty of different sauces, emats and vegetarian options.  I ordered the pork sungur which had incredibly tender chunks of meat in a spicy tomato and garlic sauce.  This, along with plain boiled rice and a coke came to about \u00a310 which seemed steep at the time, but the food's quality made up for it without a doubt.  \nMy friend ordered two starters of different pakoras which looked and - apparantly - tasted great.  We both agreed that it was worth a shot again, maybe next time after we get our student grants in though!"
4,"No wait at all... very cool people on the patio, and nice service.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I wasn't blown away by the food; however, was decent bar good.   My wife and I will definitely be going back!"
4,"Fantastic wine bar in the Old Town area, and surprisingly affordable. They accommodated a large bachelorette party (eyeroll, I know), and even gave us a special dessert for the bachelorette. \n\nI had to do double takes to check the wine bottles prices - incredible selections for extremely cheap. And there's a list of 10% on the back of inventory that they need to move.\n\nWine bars can typically disappoint with food - small plates, portions, and just mediocre. Not the case - portions were reasonable, and every hard-to-please girl was happy. Highly recommend the bruschetta sampler as a starter.\n\nCute patio, live music. Overall, a hit."
4,"This could have been a five star review if it was only relative to the food.  But I bumped it down just because of the no frills type place it is and the fact it can be extremely loud with all the sushi chefs constantly yelling or it's more like war cries but whatever.  I walked in there today and one of them started giving me a power clap style ovation....meh....my kind of guy so I obliged with my own clapping right back!  All in good fun :)\n\nOk, so no other place in Charlotte does a sushi buffet like this joint.  If you are hungry you can't find a better deal, it's something like $10, for all you can eat.  You could easily spend that on just 2 rolls anywhere else.  The sushi here is kind of \""Americanized\"" in my opinion.  I'm not complaining but seriously, just know that if you eat sushi that has been deep fried, um, that's not healthy.  \n\nThey keep time labels on the sushi plates so as to make sure the sushi is the freshest it can be but normally the sushi runs out before the time does, so that should tell you something!  It's really good.  \n\nI will continue to keep Ru San's in my Ru-tation for great local sushi spots! :)\n\nNote: It can get crowded so I suggest getting there as close to 11:30 for lunch, otherwise you may have to wait (even though probably not long)."
4,"Cute retro, mid century modern, designed yogurt shop. The shop girls are friendly but I do find it a bit odd that they come around and oversee patrons as they self-select the yogurt. I guess I'm just accustomed to being left to go hog wild in my yogurt selections without having to be self conscious about an employee looking over my shoulder. Maybe the shop is badly designed with bad blind spots and there are too many opportunities for us to get into trouble. Anyways I hope the shop finds a way to be less conspicuous about keeping an eye on us would-be troublemakers. \n\nKudos to their raspberry sauce. I was delighted that it didn't come in a squeeze bottle and contained bits of whole raspberries. Their topping selection as a whole is very impressive. You can get whole hostess cupcakes and little Debbie peanut butter wafers among other non-traditional toppings."
4,"Firkin On Paradise is a British themed pub in the Las Vegas Bar Belt at Paradise and Harmon. It is big on fun and small on price.\n\n   Throughout Firkin On Paradise, TVs show sports. Firkin ties in sports with beer and food specials. At the time of our visit during the soccer game $2 beers and a $5 fish and chips special were featured. \n\n  Here are several reasons I would return to  Firkin on Paradise. Their $4.50  price for beer is reasonable. By the way this is half the price that the Hofbrauhaus across the street charges. Their $2 beer special is sensational. The pub has an average noise level where I can hear myself talk and think. From the Yelp pictures, the food looks delicious. The servers are friendly and informative of the specials. There are plenty of TVs to watch sports that include soccer and football. There are pool tables. The British pub theme rocks. It is across from the Hard Rock where I can continue to have a good time. It is in back of Kiss Mini Golf (after a few beers Kiss Mini Golf could be challenging). And I am a fan of drinking  beer in a pub."
4,The food was very good - we all needed doggy bags!  Service was fast and friendly. Would definitely come back!
4,"Consistently good!!\nMy husband suggested this place for dinner last week. Our picky daughter however wasn't having it. I thought about eating eating here for a whole week and finally bribed my child with fortune cookies and went there for lunch today. \nI always order the same thing, pan fried noodles with shrimp (spicy). The vegetables and shrimp were cooked perfectly as usual. It is a lot of food, but it is hard not to eat the whole thing. My picky daughter actually enjoyed her chicken teriyaki with noodles. She ate most of it and of course finished with two fortune cookies.\nThe place has always been clean and the service friendly. I just wish they would bring all our meals out at the same time rather than one at a time."
4,"Finally tracked down Sausagefest at StrEATs. Originally, from Chicago's southside, we put the Polish and Hot Italian to the test. Both measured up! The Vietnamese rolls untraditional, but they totally work. It's a great bun to meat ratio. It's soft and chewy yet strong enough to hold all the tasty bites inside. The fries are skin on and fried crisp just like we could get back home, too. Rock on, Sausagefest! We'll be back for more."
4,"Excellent! \nI haven't been to a Red Lobster in literally YEARS!!\nWe had recently ate at a \""high end\"" sea food place in town, with an unbalanced product:value ratio. Red Lobster was a refreshing surprise at a fraction of the price. \n\nGF had a gift card, so we popped in during Lobster Fest.\nEverything, and I mean EVERYTHING was great!!\n\nWe were quoted 45 minutes for a table and were seated in 20.\nEvery point of contact was polite, but casual. The biscuits are everything I was promised, the specialty cocktails are delightful, and specials really covered all tastes.\n\nI got two, perfectly cocked and wonderfully seasoned lobster tails.  \nGF had the Surf & Turf which she said was great, but wouldn't let me taste, as she was too excited to eat it herself. (j/k, she reads these)\n\nIf I had to lodge a complaint: \nThe water in the bathroom sink gets hot too fast.\n\nWe had an very good mean, with great service, for literally 1/3 of what we paid at a fine dining, sea food specific establishment (see next review)."
4,"Fun park with lots of swings and slides. The water play area is fun and a refreshing break from the sun. Unfortunately, depending on the day, it can tend to get very crowded, and this close to an urban city you tend to get people from all walks of life converging in one place, I'm talking about the bad elements. There are nice courteous hard working people that come to the park to have a nice peaceful and respectful time, and then there are the rest, those are the ones you have to worry about."
4,"Four visits to understand why my phone was not activating correctly. Each visit offered a new insight on what was wrong with my switch from an Iphone to an Android. It was not really their fault for not knowing. As long as they put in the effort and eventually addressed the issue at hand, I am satisfied with the service."
4,"This place is a delight. Vegetarians, many of the dishes can be made meatless, so don't be afraid to ask. In fact, they have SOY-rizo which you can substitute for the Mexican chorizo with a couple entr\u00e9es. This tells me all is made to order (I approve!) The decor is more homey, artsy/craftsy then fancy/schmancy. Not my taste but the effort is appreciated. Don't forget to BYOB... or on certain nights, when you order 2 entrees and an appetizer (they call it a \""small plate\"") you get a complimentary bottle of wine. We finished with coffee and flowerless chocolate torte. Perhaps the best I've ever had in my long dessert-filled life. FRESHly brewed coffee (just for me!) makes all the difference. The chef/owner came out to say hello and check on us. An appreciated touch. Would recommend and will return (that the chocolate tort better be on the menu!!!)"
4,Small little place down to earth quiet setting awesome biscuits and gravy you have to come before 11 or you won't get breakfast
4,"Beautiful hotel.... I loved that there wasn't a casino in it or tons of\ncrazed smokers. This hotel was super elegant with comfortable\neverything. I was in the lap of luxury.\n\nMy favorite feature was the LCD inside the bathroom mirror, so you\ncould brush your teeth and watch t.v. at the same time. Although, the\nnovelty of it washed away quickly, the deep bathtub (that can most\ncertainly fit 2) was just as great. Ahhhhhh.......\n\nAlso, every morning we ordered breakfast to the room. Not only was it absolutely delicious, but the service was phenomenal!\n\nIf you're looking for an elegant time in Las Vegas, Trump Hotel is the way to go!"
4,"I am a big fan of skinnyfats and I come here once a week. Today I was disappointed about the level of customer service that the waitress had. We are a group of 4 and all the food came out except mine. My partner asked the server of the status of the food. The waitress gave attitude and did not express empathy for the salad not being ready with the rest of the meals. She came back and slammed a house salad in front of me and told her that I ordered a quinoa salad with chicken then she just took the plate back. She finally came back with the correct plate and walked away. As a customer service manager for a financial institution, I have high expectations of the service here. The other employees were nice and engaging with the guests. This employee needs coaching and feedback. The food was amazing."
4,"This is an absolutely stunning building. I highly recommend a visit and if you're a nerd like me, take the tour of the Nationality Rooms. There are some 20-something rooms outfitted in the style of one of the nationalities that helped to build the city of Pittsburgh. Be careful and check the tour times before you go."
4,Getting your car serviced or if your just in the area. \n\nLocated at the Ford dealership. \n\nThis place has great priced breakfast. \n\nI got the egg and cheese croissant. \n\nWould come back again and again!\n\nOne star loss because it takes so long after you order to get your food!
4,"I love this place! Great margaritas and fajitas. I've only been there in the summer and it tends to be a little warm in the dining area. If not for that, I'd definitely give it 5 stars!"
4,"In the almost-3 years I've lived in Las Vegas, I've seen new Roberto's locations pop up all over the place.  One thing to remember is that many of the stores are owned by different people, and the quality and menu definitely vary from store to store.  For some reason, the green salsa at this place is WAY hotter than it is at the other locations I've been too.  Huh.\n\nThis Roberto's is the closest to where I live, and it has always been pretty good.  The carne asada is so-so, the breakfast burritos are okay, but I've found that the carnitas here are better than other Roberto's locations.  When you order the carnitas they quickly fry them to a crisp right before putting them in the burrito or taco.  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it."
4,Welcome to the neighborhood Pita Jungle.  The food is as good as the other locations and the service is very friendly.  I wish the bar area was a little larger.  The outside patio is a great option on nice days.
4,"Stopped in last night for some take out.  I was very impressed with how nice and knowledgeable everyone was.  I asked if the tortillas were vegan (they were!!) so I asked for two veggie burritos and as they were making them for me, the manager told me that she'd give me a sample of their soup, as it was vegan also.  No need for a sample, sign me up for the full cup!  I love tortilla soup, and theirs is tomato based, weeeeeee!  My burrito came with amazing cilantro lime rice (way more limey than Chipotle), black beans, guac, fajita veggies, pico and medium salsa.  It was divine!  My woman was equally pleased with the outcome of her burrito (rice, beans,fajita veggies, and pico).  When I was a cheese eater, I would order their chips and queso dip, which is totally yumsky."
4,"Oh  Sam Fox, I love you.  I am a huge fan of the culinary confections that you whip up and have never been disappointed when dining at a FRC restaurant.  Culinary Dropout is no exception. I have been here several times, for drinks and appetizers, for lunch and for dinner and everytime I am pleased with the food.  The service has had a few hiccups, but nothing earth shattering. The bacon bloody mary is delicious and the salmon is dreamy and the pretzels and fondue, OMG...you had me at fondue.  Keep up the good work and I will keep giving you my money.  :)"
4,Great new hotel. Everything is brand new. I really like the King bedroom suite. The pool and breakfast area are really nice. I'll come here again for vacation.
4,A great place for a meal at Phoenix airport. Way above expectations for the regular fare. A fresh and simple take on tex mex.
4,"Do you love noodle factory? Your answer is YES? Than Noodle factory is for you.\n\nI can say that I know lot of Montreal's Chinatown restaurants. These bistros, restaurants etc are not fancy though, which is good to enjoy their cultural food. But sometime, I can't really get what I want.\n\nFrom all of them (considering only Chinatown), I love just one - Noodle factory - noodles, dumplings etc at great price in cosy familiar environment served on your table."
4,"Do not let the strip mall, small location deter you from visiting this sushi place.  We just went with a huge assortment of sashimi with a sprinkling of grilled mackerel and edamame.  For being in the Scottsdale area right of the 101, the sashimi was very fresh and we got the insider hookup for wasabi.  This place is a keeper."
4,"Umphrey's 2,000th show!\n\nNot a bad venue at all, the sound was good and the security was cool. They have a place next door making taffy apples but of course we ran late both nights and couldn't grab any.\n\nReasonable parking garage a block away beats crappy Madison street parking."
4,"Wanted to hit up a new Indian food place and decided on the Curry Garden. At first glance, the inside is not exactly glamorous but again it's about the food right?\n\nI ordered the Paneer Tikka Masala, Bhatura, and Garlic Naan. It was delicious! There was plenty of Paneer in the dish (deliciously fresh) and the sauce was great. The Bhatura was made very well, but make sure you eat it when it's hot (so good for dipping). The Garlic Naan was good as well, with a generous amount of Garlic.\n\nAll in all this place had great food and service, although the design inside was not great, it was clean.\n\nLook forward to coming to this place again if I need my Paneer fix :)."
4,"Great bar area and a pretty good selection of food. The bartenders and very friendly and attentive. The wait staff is decent, the seem as though they are in a hurry at times even if the place is not packed. Overall a good place to hang and watch a game with all the TV's they have there."
4,"I love the atmosphere and the food was great, you get to sing and dance there if you aren't shy."
4,"We bought an online gift certificate for this place while we were in Vegas and were pleasantly surprised,  Service was excellent. I had a ribeye that was perfectly perfectly prepared and the sides were great too.  I ended my meal with the creme brulee and it was great!  For a restaurant inside a casino it was really first rate."
4,"This is a review of HOB Vegas as a concert venue. The food, I've had before and no offense but I'd seriously pass on it...\n\nWe saw AFI here this last January. AFI is one of my favorite bands, but more like a 90's version of them and not like the current circa 2000's December underground version. \n\nAs for the venue, this place kinda rocks. It is stadium seating so no problem getting a good view. I feel like it was general admission (pretty sure) but we had no problem getting really good seats. No problem getting in and out of the venue. Even with a long line it moved pretty fast. Good sound overall for the one show we experienced here. Their bar service was really fast with no waits upstairs.\n\nI prefer this HOB over Anaheim any day. Plus the \""disneyland\"" you deal with in Vegas is a lot cooler than the real one. And you don't have to deal with soccer mom's trying to run you over with their strollers..."
4,Breakfast was great.  Samantha was awesome. Only ate eggs and chorizo but would have loved to try the carbs.  Pancakes and muffins looked amazing.
4,"I really want to give this place five stars because my taste buds were blown out if the water, but due to the hygiene issues, I just can't. \n\nI read the reviews and was expecting a bit of a dive, and a peek into the kitchen cleanliness there seemed fine but the cursory wipe of the table and cabbage remnant on the chili bowl were a bit distressing. However I wasn't going to let this get between me and some stellar dumplings. \n\nWe tried both pure steamed lamb and chive and fried pork and cabbage. The lamb and chive dumplings were amazing, strong flavors and good size. These were rounder dumplings. I tend to poke them to allow the boiling water and steam to escape. I loved the pork dumplings as well but the fried style just didn't hit with me as much as the pure steamed. \n\nOverall definitely go here. The dumplings are incredible, and the side salads are delicious. Just don't look at the rug."
4,"The Habit is a good change from normal burger joints. It's like a classy, \""Carl's Jr.\"" Their menu is OK and the service was decent. The parking during lunch time is tough so get there early."
4,"While rolling down Smallman to go to 21 St Coffee, I saw a little sign that said \""Donuts\"". Hmmmm, maybe.. \nIt's a small storefront, just enough room to make donuts and buy them. After getting my quad Mocha I stopped in and met Ron, the Owner, a nice guy. The donuts are made right there at the counter in a mini donut making machine. See, they are little, cute donuts. And they get a little bigger, but I did not witness one as big as usual. My little ones were made fresh and of the Devils Food variety. The were fried right there in front of my eyes and then Ron dropped them in a bag with some sugar and it was \""Oh, My\"", good. Perfect with the mocha, too. Good stuff. The only star I take away is for price. $3 for a dozen little donuts, eh, maybe, maybe not. They were fresh, but I'm Blue collar, I work for my money...4 stars, good stuff, Ron..(eh, I made a typo in the name and it didnt save the edit, oopsie)"
4,"One of the best Thai Restaurants in Phoenix. Nothing fancy from the outside, but inside provides an authentic vibe, great service and amazing food at good prices. The new website (includes photos of dishes) helps with take-out ordering. The Pad Thai and #35 on the menu are a must."
4,"I lovelovelove this place. the variety of breads/pretzels/sausages and other meats, as well as soups, snacks, pickled delicacies of every kind...wow.\n\nwe stopped in yesterday, and left with one of their horseshoe-shaped soft pretzels, a bag of pretzel sticks, and the most AMAZING creamy dill-lemon-caper-honey mustard...\n\nnext time, I'm stocking up on their myriad varieties of gummy candies :)"
4,"Get the Malaysian fried rice. Unbelievable. If you're into sushi, I recommend the panther roll. Curries are very good too.   Sometimes the service has been off a bit, but the food is excellent."
4,"Very clean and modern, safe area.  Pleasant front desk staff, called me after check-in to make sure all was ok.  Detached sitting area, fridge, spacious, big TV.\nNegatives:  Strange thermostat, hard to figure out, and the usual lame Arabica Hyatt in room coffee.\nNot on older car GPS software, as it is a newer hotel, so beware if you are driving and have an older car, can be tricky to get to unless you know where you are going.\nWhen I woke at 7AM on a Sunday it was very quiet and I was surprized at how peaceful it was, unlike weekend Embassy Suites, but then very shortly thereafter I heard kids running up and down the hall and mirthfully screaming in Spanish.  There was a congregation of seven people loudly chatting, also in Spanish,  in the hall who seemed to deliberately get even louder when I stuck my head out to see what the commotion was about.  I suppose I cannot blame the hotel for the rudeness of its family-oriented clientele, however, as this is a universal problem in cheaper hotels with large rooms and extra sleeping areas.  Perhaps a check-in written discrete request to guests asking them to respect quiet hours would be in order? ( I know, wishful thinking)."
4,"I stayed at the Wigwam 2 nights for a work weekend retreat. This is a great location for retirees for mostly golfing and shopping. We happened to visit for a Leadership Summit for my company. This is a nice location to have a conference for work. The room was spacious with a wet bar, living room with fireplace, and luxuriously soft bed! I had the best nap of my life in that bed. It was divine! The decor is Southwestern/Ranch style. I am more of a fan of modern decor but I was still very comfortable during my stay. I would not normally stay here mainly due to the style but I found it very relaxing and comfortable."
4,Met up with some of my favorite folks last night because I NEEDED some cheese enchiladas paired with a margarita or two.  This little place has great service and really nice servers and wait staff...it was an enjoyable evening from start to finish.  The food is good ol' sonoran-style and I changed up my regular order to include green chile .  Yum Yum Yum!!!!  I like the fact that there are vegetarian options and the prices are really reasonable.  One of my friends has been eating there weekly for several years now so that's a pretty high recommendation.  I'm finding out that they have other regulars as well.  Still looking for the perfect red sauce but this place is OK in my book.
4,"A good watch tends to say a lot about it's owner, and can be as important as a house or car for those that want to convey their status, style or wealth to others. Given that I can check the time on my mobile phone, and I've always found watches a bit irritating and itchy to wear, I'll likely continue to use my ill-fitting cheap suit and filthy training shoes to let people know where I fit in the scheme of things.\n\nFor watch fans however, this tiny, quirky little shop will probably seem like a gift from above. The amount of timepieces packed into such a small area is truly uncanny."
4,"It's worth it if you haven't visited before. \n\n$20 ticket if purchased at Fry's. $3 soda, $5 beer, $7.50 Turkey Legs, $5 Brownie with Ice-cream. \n\nRemember to bring sun screen and Hat. Be prepared to walk a lot. Things are very expensive to buy. Very busy too.\n\nLot of shows, little bit of everything for everyone."
4,"diamond in the rough for sure. surrounding neighborhood is full of rotted out houses, but this place does great things regardless of their location.  charcuterie platter was great, prices are affordable for the quality presented, and the staff was eager.  i recommend the duck egg ravioli, because the brown butter and fried swiss chard give it a winning edge.  fois grois mousse was creamy and the flavor was great with the fig paste, but is was a clunky eat and hard to divide.  all in all we ate like kings, drank a bottle of wine, had desert and split a glass of prosecco for less than $120.  if i lived in the area i would find an excuse to go eat the charcuterie platter a couple times a week over drinks."
4,"Don't miss this great spot!  My friend lives nearby so we've visited for breakfast several times.  The coffee is pretty great.  The vanilla latte is a favorite - rich and smooth without a hint of bitterness.  Menu item are unique and varied but I find that I keep going back to the short rib burrito - delish!  Portion sizes are waaaay too big.  I'm usually full after half my meal so I request a to-go box when I place my order and my friends do the same.  The wait can be long but the fast and friendly service makes up for that once you get inside.  Cons for me include uncomfortable table seating (though the booths are comfortable) plus the fact that you have to look pretty hard to find healthy menu selections. They're pleasant as can be about subbing out ingredients, though, so that's a plus."
4,"Nice restaurant. Met both the husband and wife team. Very friendly. The food was good, and the service was great. I will eat there again."
4,"Whilst exploring the wonderful sights of Edinburgh, a spot of lunch and a pit stop was required. \n\nUnfortunately the cafe that had been recommended to me, was shut over the festive period so I decided to pop into this cafe / bistro instead which was close by. \n\nThe cafe was nice and quiet with only three other customers, so getting a table and ordering some lunch wasn't a problem.\n\nI was warmly greeted by the waitress who immediately showed me to a table. I knew what I wanted to order straight away, as the menus are stuck on the windows to entice customers in. I ordered an avocado salad and a glass of water (was feeling health conscious after the Christmas indulgence!). I didn't have to wait long for my salad to arrive which was also served with brown seeded bread.\n\nThe salad was lovely although I felt there could have been more variety of vegetables - i.e adding cucumber and spring onions would have been nice additions. Unfortunately too much vinaigrette was added to the salad which meant the salad leaves were dripping in oil. What a shame. Hence why a star is lost for his review. \n\nWould I return again? Yes I would as the service was great and there are plenty of food and drink options."
4,Great place to go for great beer and amazing food. It is really hard to have a group larger then 6 to get a table together sense they really don't allow reservations.
4,I ordered the spinach rice and beans which was excellent. Service was slow to start I waited 10 minutes for a cup of tea. Lunch is a very busy time but it'd still return because the food is very good
4,"Ordered from Little Nippers II multiple times.  Each time I have been happy with what I have received, but I wouldn't call it fast food.\n\nGood food takes time to make, and in the case of their mild wings, they are good!  Skip the packet of dressing they give you and go home and put some quality blue cheese on these wings and you are in business!  \n\nTheir pizza is o.k., but I have to say that I have not found pizza in Pittsburgh that measures up to the ones I can get back in New York, but then again their is a pizza place on every corner in my hometown. \n\nI will definitely be back, but will also make sure to call in or grub hub my order before to minimize the wait time."
4,"Love the fish sandwiches, they are all they are cracked up to be.  If you want lunch - try a sandwich here - but order ahead for pick up, or be prepared to wait 30 minutes or more in a shady looking bar.  The bar is very smoky, although it is also stocked with a soda machine if you get thirsty waiting for your sandwich to be made.   Although for a fish sandwich and fries you'll probably drop about $10, I think its definitely worth it."
4,"Really great place! We used to frequent the location in Mesa, but the manager was a total witch! I am serious--my bf, at the time, and I would go there, weekly, and she would never acknowledge us, or even attempt to be polite to the customers, so we stopped going. I am glad we gave the Bell Rd. location a try. The service was excellent! We were greeted, with a big smile, and seated immediately. Our server was excellent. Food is great. We always order the same thing, a skillet for me and Eye Opener Combo for the hubster. We are definitely excited to welcome this franchise back in to our rotation of wonderful breakfast joints!"
4,"The free little chocolate tour is fun, the cactus garden is cool and the best part is being able to chocolates at the end, I particularly like the Creme Liqueurs! If you havent had them you need to try them!"
4,"The restaurants in the Mekong Plaza are all worth at least one try. The Wholly Grill is one that is worth a second, third and fourth try. We needed something good and cheap for dinner, and are all about supporting local businesses when we can, so we meandered over to the Plaza to see what the food court had to offer. We opted for Wholly Grill and were not disappointed! \n\nI got the grilled pork belly and my partner went for the pork skewers. I couldn't tell you which one I liked more. The skewers were tender and juicy, and my partner loved the eggplant salad she got with it. They reminded me of the awesome street food you find in that part of the world. My pork belly was crispy on the outside, and the perfect texture on the inside. If not cooked right, pork belly can be chewy, rubbery or like trying to gnaw on a piece of fat. This was not like that at all. I was full and kept eating. Every time I thought I was done, I saw another piece of meat on my plate and had to have it. \n\nThe staff was super friendly. When asked what she recommended, she giggled and said the pork belly, like she wasn't expecting a ginger, white girl to go with her suggestion. There are a few more things on the menu I'd like to try, if I can get around ordering something other than the pork belly. Which I'm already craving again."
4,"I got a small vanilla chai tea latte to go. The cup was just the right size for me, and it was delicious. The only negative would be that it was $3 for such a small size."
4,"Went for Restaurant Week with a friend. Adorable little place, wonderful atmosphere. The squid was just slightly overcooked but everything else was perfect. Service was great. Bring your own wine."
4,"As a chain restaurant and slightly on the edge of being called fast food, I really enjoy Chipotle! \n\nThe food is fresh and delicious! Chipotle has a philosophy for their products, \""Food with integrity.\"" They offer vegetarian options and naturally raised and hormone free meat options. It makes me feel good about not just eating delicious and a lot of it, but also from a company that is trying to be environmentally friendly. On each cup there is a story about one of their products or how they do something in the company...it's fun to read. \n\nThe staff there are very friendly! I was a bit surprised at how helpful and friendly they were as I was going down the assembly line for my burrito. It has indoor and outdoor seating to suit all types as well. You can even order online so it's ready when you get there.\n\nGreat food and great service! I'm a fan."
4,"We were craving something light and decided to try this place.  I love a good sushi and sashimi plate, and there were plenty of items on the menu to pick from.  We decided to do some of the small share plates and were not dissappointed.  We ordered a total of 6 items, and all were very fresh and tasty.  The sauces we tried were outstanding.  The service was extremely good....very friendly, efficient and sincere.  Definitely would eat here again...."
4,"Je suis pass\u00e9e ici par hasard alors que j'avais d'autres commissions \u00e0 faire dans le coin. Je ne connais pas vraiment Ahuntsic, mais vu la senteur de pain frais qui se d\u00e9gageait de cette boulangerie, je n'ai pas pu r\u00e9sister y entrer pour une petite visite. Ils ont vraiment de tous pour un bon repas: du pain, des p\u00e2tisseries, des pains, des p\u00e2t\u00e9s, des pains, des fromages, des pains, e plats pr\u00e9par\u00e9s en avance \u00e0 r\u00e9chauffer \u00e0 la maison, et bien s\u00fbr des pains. J'y ai go\u00fbt\u00e9 le pain \u00e0 l'\u00e9rable et aux noix qui \u00e9tait simplement divin. Je suis toutefois repartie \u00e0 la maison avec une miche de pain aux raisins et noix qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9 comme je le voulais. C'\u00e9tait un bon pain dense avec une cro\u00fbte bien solide mais pas trop difficile \u00e0 manger et une mie moelleuse qui ne fait pas trop de miettes. Si cette boulangerie \u00e9tait plus pr\u00e8s de chez nous, j'en serais probablement une cliente r\u00e9guli\u00e8re!"
4,"So, this is where all the beautiful and cool people hang out.  I had no idea :-)\nI wonder if they expected it to be this popular?  The casino in general was confusing to me but maybe that's because I'm never there.  It wasn't just me though; it wasn't until I asked a fourth employee that I was able to locate the will call desk for the boulevard concert venue.  In general everyone here seems helpful and having a good time and the crowd is definitely younger and more into partying.  The underground parking is a challenge.  Maybe crank up the lighting a bit...I have a feeling that's what purgatory will look like.\n\nI saw the band New Order play outside at the pool.  I felt the show was great despite not being a huge fan of pool concerts.  The pool deck is small and cramped...there must have been 4,000+ people crammed out there.  Acoustics are marginal given the environment but the set list was epic including 4 songs from Joy Division.  Those that left early before the encore missed out...Losers!  A true fan stays until the house lights come up and the band is gone for good.  All in all it was a great experience and I had the chance to meet some cool people from Yelp for the first time."
4,"Having been obsessed with boba tea for the last month, our never ending quest to try every boba tea joint in Las Vegas lead us here.  Although this place is called the Sesame House, you would never know it.  Its inside the Chinatown Plaza mall area where they have a sign outside just saying \""No. 1 Boba\"".  \n\nI would say this is probably the second best place I've been next to Tea Planet but the prices are better here.  Not too much of an atmosphere though.  But the fruit is fresh and they do have quite a selection of dried fruits etc."
4,"A must go to place for breakfast, brunch or lunch in Vieux Quebec.  My wife found it extremely \""cute\"" and fell in love with the place.  If you go around 11 you will be in good shape for an early lunch or brunch.  Breakfast did not seem to be much of a jam on the weekday we went (we went twice by the way). \n\nAll the pastries are wonderful, especially the cheese biscuit which has a little cayenne kick to it.  \n\nWifey loved the cuban panini.  I thought the filling was great but I personally am not a big fan of overly toasted bread (not burnt).  That being said, I would order one of their paninis again any day and love to devour some cheese biscuits for dessert.  And do yourself a favor and get a large cappucino.\n\nNot really that expensive in comparison to all the tourist traps you could get sucked into in the Old City."
4,"Very authentic thai food! I had the beef jerky, pad thai, papaya salad and sticky rice ! All were delicious. They offer a huge thai tea ! I took off one star for the location. But I will definitely come back for the service and food."
4,"I've flown in and out of here more times than Anna Nicole Smith's pharmacists flew in and out of the Bahamas. I find the inside extremely easy to navigate while the outside a labyrinth of epic proportions. What lane do I exit to the 202. The left? Oh, now the middle? And then 100 yards later the left again? WTF? Is this fun for the traffic monitors as they scarf down Cheetos and Dr. Pepper all the while watching weary travelers zig zag the ridiculous signage. Services are average to pretty good in terms of bars, restaurants and shops. Not sure what the complainers aren't finding. All I need is a bar, a snack, the boob tube, Dramamine, the National Enquirer and that funny horseshoe shaped pillow that makes me feel like an idiot everytime I bring it out."
4,"4/5 dangerous sweets. \n\noh my. sugar. bars. yum. i'm glad i can only get this when i'm in town for business, otherwise i'd have to get pants in new sizes."
4,"Decided to try out some chicken and biscuits when flying through the airport here. Damn good stuff NC, keep up the good work."
4,"Recently trekked through the casino and found it wonderfully renovated. The casino pit looked nice and modern. No overpowering cigarette smoke and seemed fresh and clean.  Public restrooms were nearly brand new with brand new fixtures. Food court looked inviting and clean, although I didn't try the food. Yes it's an older property and like a cat has 9 lives, but who knows for how long? Overall a great face lift and I wish them the best. Not many of the classic names left, the real Las Vegas. Good luck Tropicana."
4,This Trader Joe's is friendly and offers the same great TJ's products.  What needs is improving is their parking lot!  It is so bad that Insurance companies should charge a premium for folks willing to play Russian Roulette by parking here.  I make a point of parking at the far end of the lot to avoid playing smash up derby with the elderly patrons.  Love the proximity to my home as I will be a regular here!
4,"Mmmm carbo-licious. \n\nI met the lovely Ms. Tonya P for a brief bagel this morning and 'twas delicious. Carby, crunchity toasted bagels (mmm sesame) and fab cream cheese. The schmear has to be homemade right? Because I dabbled in the chive and the vegetable - both were equally tasty. \n\nInside Poppy's has a smattering of tables and a cute little patio outside where Riley (my pup) enjoyed some bagel bits off of the concrete. Tasty. Be aware that the patio can be quite noisy with the umpteen cars passing down Providence and Sharon Amity, but no worries, I had my bagel and great company. \n\nNext time I'm in the area, I'm definitely going to pop in and pay homage to Poppy's by indulging in a nice toasty bagel and a pound of cream cheese. Nice to know that there's another local bagel joint in CLT!"
4,"I have been to Five guys in 3 different states now and I still love it. I am originally from so cal and I grew up on in and out. I only tried 5 guys because Obama went...and I ended up falling in love it. Their burgers have a lot more flavor and are just great. I actually prefer in and outs fries though. Anyways, I will keep coming here."
4,"I can't stop thinking about the french fries! I think they were batter dipped prior to frying.  The buffalo chicken sandwich was good. Good size menu with something for everyone. Large open style, good for groups. Plenty of tvs. Kinda felt more like an Applebee's than a place is go regularly to watch games. I will definitely go back for the fries."
4,"How can you go wrong with Buca Di Beppo's? The food here is unbelievable and the portions are enormous. I guess that's why you can only order the pasta plates for groups of 2 or 4. But in reality, there's prob enough food there for 4-6 people. The pasta is cooked very nicely and the sauces are delicious. This location was packed every time I went so I would suggest putting in a reservation during the dinner hours."
4,"Gr8 sushi and teppan table cooking in a beautiful restaurant w/gracious servers.  Appetizers are delicious.  Kind of pricey but lots of coupons available for locals.  I like the rolls, tofu, filet, seaweed salad and vegetarian teppan."
4,"I have always been a fan of Oyshi Sushi as it took my sushi virginity! I wish the prices dropped to be more comparable to other sushi spots in the area but all one can do is hope. AYCE is the safest bet for a dinner out with a table for two or more. You ensure no one will need to wash dishes in the back if they get carried away with indulging. We all have those dinner friends who have the mindset of caviar budgets but the reality of dollar-value-menu wallets. \n\nService is usually a hit or miss. I've gotten service that has made me not want to leave. On the other hand I've experienced servers at this establishment that made me want to request take-out. (which they do offer). \n\nThe draw back for this place is they don't do half orders like other spots. It's also nowhere near the strip. Which is a catch-22. The wait can be timely depending on the day of the week. If it were closer to the strip it would be an endless wait.\n\nMussels, Love Affair, Lobster Fair, Oyshi Roll, and the Japanese Lasagna are my favorites!"
4,"We have eaten at this restaurant since it opened and it's always a great experience.  Most of the Teppan chefs have great personality and do an entertaining job of preparing the food.  The owners, Barry and Ahn, are very friendly and constantly walk the floor interacting with customers and checking to make sure everything is good.  They remember regular customers and are always happy to welcome you back.\n\nThe Happy Hour menu is very good with a variety of choices.  The sushi is always fresh and well prepared.\n\nI noticed in a previous post that someone commented that the restaurant is loud.  Being as there are several Teppan tables, it can get loud - but in a fun and appropriate way.  They also have a huge patio and if you've never witnessed an Arizona sunset from there, you're missing out.\n\nAs I mentioned, we've been coming to this restaurant since it opened - sometimes a couple of times a week. We will continue to do so."
4,"We came here on a Tuesday afternoon for celebration lunch! We used the Lunch Groupon AYCE and AYCD for 2 for $36. \n\n- Smile! Our picture was taken before we sat. \n- Common variety: Salad, Mexican, Soup, Mid-Eastern, Asian, American, Italian, Seafood, and Dessert.\n- AYCD - unlimited Beer and Wine! Champagne Life Neyo! And all the ladies say, uh-huh! \n- Get the strawberry crumb cupcake. delicious! \n- They have cotton candy for the kids! haha. \n- Poor sushi selection. No Crab legs. \n- Come for the Mexican food, Salad, and American food. \n- The drinks were most rewarding. Food was average. Not bad for $36 or $18/person for food and drinks! :)"
4,"So I went here with a Bosnian friend, that ordered for me. \n\nIt's quite a sterile cafe-ish environment. Kinda like a bakery, because they have bread and pastries - but then again its not. It's different, not in a cozy way.\n\nSo I was dealt this plate with a huge round bread on it (maybe 10 inches in diameter). The bread freshly made, very hot with a light coat of oil on it. The bread was cut in half like a hamburger bun, but inside instead of a burger patty it was full of seasoned sausage meat. This dish is called \u0107evap\u010di\u0107i, or cevapi for short. \n\nThere is nothing more to this meal, but the bread was delicious and the sausage was nice and tasty. I couldn't finish it, even if I ate on a totally empty stomach. this was a different experience for me, but one I would do again. next time I'd save some room for tasty looking Bosnian pastries too. \n\nThe owners was super nice, even if the service is more in a east european anarchic way. You tell them what you want, they bring it you pay. No checking on you - if you want something, you let them know. I actually like this as a guest in their bakery - don't bring your hooters' waitress expectations here."
4,"This place got it going on! Service is unbelievably fast and the atmosphere is great. \nI had the \""Leo's Sandwich\"" and it was definitely a good choice. Even the water tastes good here. \nThe only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is because they haven't really gotten the hang of the wait list. It seems sort of unorganized and it didn't help that someone else used my name to be seated."
4,"I can't say enough about this grocery store. They have excellent customer service and I never experience cashier lines more than one or two people deep. They have a small selection of Organic vegetables, but the quality is very high; a decent selection of beer - beyond the usual bud light / coors light offering and the selection of baking supplies is as good as I've seen at a grocery store. I'll go out of my way to shop here."
4,I'm giving them 4 starts based off of the staff. Nicest people around. I have had there sandwiches and pizza. Both were OK.
4,"Service good. Expensive again 2 omelets for 80 and coffee, juice no alcohol.  Vegas is crazy expensive. Food great though.\n\nRight by the pool so we ate and lounged after.  you have to walk around a bit for a place outside. The outside eating patio isn't always open."
4,Busy cozy colorful place with great Mexican food at a reasonable price. Lots of  blue collar workers have lunch here. They know good food.
4,"Loved it!  My daughter and I went there for lunch and were very happy with our order, as our sandwiches were delicious!  I had their capri sandwich on ciabatta and my daughter had the turkey/bacon on ciabatta.  I didn't get the name of the guy behind the counter, but he was awesome!  Very friendly and willing to answer all of our questions about our sandwiches.  We are definitely going back :)"
4,"I stopped by Sushi Style today for a bite of lunch.  Even though it was lunch hour and a lot of places are jam-packed, this sushi restaurant was busy but not to the point you had to wait for service.\n\nThe waitress was fantastic.  Before I even had settled fully in she had brought a delicious glass of fresh iced tea with lemon. I've been to places where you just have no idea if the tea has been sitting out for hours and is beginning to sour and it's not a pleasant experience.  \n\nI had a tootsie roll which was very good..the eel sauce combined with the crunch on a crab California roll was awesome.  I also had an Arizona roll which was again, awesome.  I will most likely be back very soon again for lunch or dinner.  My husband and I only go to one or two places for sushi, and this place gives Yen Sushi a run for its money with its broad menu and great service."
4,I always get my acrylics done here! They're a little our of my way but so far the best place I've found in awhile. Tina does an excellent job of making them all even and thinner at my request. I can usually make it 3 weeks at most between fills. Great place!!! Definitely recommend and the prices are very reasonable.
4,"Phenomenal lunch buffet during the week! Its $13.99 (give or take a $1), a good mixture of vegetarian options, chicken, pork and beef. The Naan bread is to die for, and they just keep bringing it on out!\n\nThe only bad thing about going here for lunch is that you definitely need a nap after!"
4,"Great service behind the bar, and a really informative tour. The beer garden wasn't open this time of year, but still had a great visit and tried some pretty solid brews."
4,"Makes some of my favorite bagels in the world.  Great place for breakfast, but the challah is a little sketchy some days, knowing a Jewish friend.  I can also get my Chompies bagels at the grocery store which another added plus."
4,"Los Dos serves up a mean friggin Chimichanga. \n\nYour choice of meat, deep-fried and topped with guacamole, sour cream and New Mexico green chili sauce. \n\nIf this fried burro mecca provided free chip and salsa refills it would get the 5-star Monte! \n\nGreat margaritas and brew too!"
4,"This was one of my go to chains when I was Chicago so I'm happy to see one right in downtown Pittsburgh.  I got the opportunity to try it out today although I figured I knew what to expect since franchises try to be consistent in quality and taste regardless of their location.  \n\nThis is just how I remember it.  It's affordable, relatively quick, and tasty.  Please note the order b/c if you ask me are their better tasting places out there - sure.  Are there cheaper places our there - yes, and are their faster places out there - of course.  But to have the trifecta - well that does take a little more effort than having one or another of those qualities.  \n\nWhich is why this place gets 4 stars - it probably helps that it's also close to where I work."
4,"Was tricky to find but well worth the hunt!!! Great tacos, and friendly chef! We will definitely be back for more!!!"
4,This Wendys just happen to be remodeled and my girlfriend and I decided to stop in and take a look at the new design of the store. the remodel has changed how you order and pick up now you order at one area and pick up another the dining room area has been completely remodeled with new tables new atmosphere and even a small ones area oh and boot there is wifi.
4,it is almost ok for lunch. not expensive\uff0c nice environment. But the kinds of dishes provided is not too much.
4,"St. Francis is one of my favourite places for brunch in Phoenix. Its got an up class, trendy feel. American food with a pinch and pull from all over. Good brew selection, and mimosas and bloody Marys with brunch. Plus kids under 10 eat free. \n\nThe staff has always been friendly. I haven't had the slow service others have complained about. The food takes a while to come out but that is no fault of the server. The servers have always asked about my drink when they noticed it low. \n\nMy favourite menu item has been the eggs benedict with salmon, the hollandaise sauce is perfectly tangy and buttery! They used to be served with a side of fingerling potatoes, now they only throw a few on the plate. The pork chile verde is spicy and wonderfully seasoned. Its served with a large spoon and two slices of corn bread for the stew. I also love the cioppino; it's a spicy, red seafood stew. Definitely large enough to share IMO, and served with bread. \n\nI've also come with friends for happy hour and just ordered appetizers and drinks. The feel was great and we all left happy and warmed by the fire on the patio."
4,"Switch offers a variety of food options from healthy choices to comfort food. The menu is very eclectic, and I have yet to have a bad meal from here. The portions sizes are very generous for the price and service has always been good. Some of my faves include:\n- mac & cheese: rich, creamy, flavorful cheese sauce over penne\n- caprese sandwich: typical ingredients with a great pesto vinaigrette \n - burger: your basic burger, not too fancy, but great on taste\nAlso, if you're looking to tie one on, they have some fantastic drink specials especially on Sundays where you can get carafes of mimosas, bloody marys, etc. for $3."
4,"We have been customers of this chain for 5 years and love their food and smoothies. \n\nThis particular location is relatively new (less than a year old currently) and in an extremely busy location.  Becuase of this the staffing levels are sporadic on the weekends and sometimes there is a 20 min wait for food. Generally it is les than 5. \n\nWhile the food and smoothies are great the cleanliness of this location is always an issue. In particular, the bathrooms are never cleaned properly. I have three young children and I honestly don't even let them use it unless it's an absolute emergency. \n\nIt's very disappointing because the staff is nice and the manager seems to be capable. I don't know how the single bathrooms gets overlooked so often. \n\nOtherwise a favorite of our family. We are here several times a week."
4,"Have been here about once a week give or take, and the food has been very consistent. The pho soup base improved a bit, but it was already better than everywhere else. I have been here when it was slow and very busy and even then, the service has been very good. Glad to have this place in Chandler..\n\nPho Viet Nam, staff n Crew... Keep up the great work.."
4,"If you ask any Asian person where they go to get their familiar spices and groceries, I'll bet 99.9% of them know about this place.  However, this isn't only for Asians, anyone can stop in and find what they're looking for as the aisles are labeled based on the culture (Filipino, Korean, etc.).  If that doesn't help, you can still explore the endless array of 'water animals', fresh baked goods, even a bubble tea counter.  They also have a small dining area which serves some traditional (it looks to be) Chinese fare.\n\nIt's quite a bit of a drive, but if we're ever in the Matthews/ Stallings area, this is a must stop for your Asian cuisine needs."
4,"It blows my mind that anyone can think In-N-Out is better than Lenny's. In-N-Out has to be the most overrated place ever. I have no idea what the appeal is; the patties are thin, the cheese is mediocre and the fries are terrible. The burger itself tastes okay, but nothing better than, say, Whataburger, which I think is a lot better than In-N-Out. Lenny's patties are actually beefy (pun intended), their cheese is good and their fries are 100x better than In-N-Out. Is it the best burger joint around? No, but it's a lot better than In-N-Out."
4,I don't have health insurance so I had to pay for my dental services. I thought the prices was okay after comparing it with other dental centers in the area. And plus they had an internet coupon for $100 off. So that's why I went with them instead of another dental center. Plus there were a number of good reviews on google for Biltmore Commons Dental Care. That gave me more confidence to use their services.  I called at 8am and I was able to get an appointment at 9am. Maybe I was lucky or maybe there's vacant spots because of the bad economy and no one is going the dentist. Who knows. Dr. Balestrino did my fillings. He took his time to explain to me what needed to be done and addressed the questions I had. I am overall pleased with this dentist visit. I would go back for my follow up in six months to get my teeth cleaned.
4,One of our favorite places to order lunch from for pick up.  We will go out of our way to get their sandwiches and salads.  The food is consistently tasty and the employees are always very nice.  We haven't tried anything on the menu yet that we didn't like!
4,"Definitely a fan of Yoforia.  These yogurt places have been popping up all over the place recently it seems.  Great concept of self-serve then weighing.  Overall the price and taste are a great combination.\n\nSometimes the line at this location can get a little crazy, but it moves along pretty fast... the good thing about the Southpark Mall location is that you can walk around the mall and wait for the line to die down."
4,"The gym is a great gym, I love the facility. It's a big gym and has quite the number of equipment. I only had one situation with the employees which was that I wasn't able to use the gym, when I had already paid, because I hadn't brought in my I.D. to complete the membership. I complained and everything was fixed. The only thing that LVAC isn't spot on is the customer service and some of the employees. Heads up, it gets packed during the day. If you're able to go at midnight, do so! It's never packed during then.  Other than that, everything there is absolutely great! Plus, it's 24 hours."
4,"Clean, friendly staff, huge portions. Not the best Mexican food i've had but it hits the spot when i've got the craving. I always tell myself that I'm only going to eat half of what I get and save the rest for another meal. It never works. I always stuff my face till it's all gone. That stuff is addictive."
4,"My girlfriend and I are currently staying at the Cosmpolitan this week. We've eaten at the brunch buffet twice since we've been here and the food is really great. The quality and variety is fantastic. There is something for everyone and everything is super fresh.\n\nOnly issue we've had is the time it takes to be seated for a table. As we were waiting on line both times, we saw that there were plenty of empty tables -many of which had already been cleared and reset.  Yet, it took a much longer time than necessary to seat everyone. There seems to be a lack of concern for seating the patrons as quickly as possible. \n\nNevertheless, the food is really enjoyable and just be sure to save room for dessert!!"
4,"Everyone is complaining that this place is pretentious...well that just happens to be one of the reasons why I come here!\n\nI love the lay out of the store, it's always clean and they let you sample whatever flavours you want downstairs before you buy. The queue is crazy on the weekend so come on a week night if you can to avoid the mayhem. You can bring the capsules back for recycling and they keep all of your info on file so there is no need to remember anything, which is perfect for me.\n\nNespresso has made me a nicer person in the morning so I for one love this store and their product."
4,"The layout and design of this Starbucks is great.  Lots of space.  Unfortunately, on our visit the team wasn't doing a very good job keeping that space clean.  The trash can is overflowing and the tables need to be wiped down.  They were friendly though and that means a lot in my book so I'm giving them 4 stars for this visit but hope they would focus on the environment a bit more and ensure food items are stocked appropriately.  That'll get them to 5."
4,"The buffet was really worth it.  Some of the dishes are wonderfully flavored.  Some are a little bland.  Their mango ice cream is very good, but the mango lassi could do without the whipped cream.  Very attentive staff.  Curry here is not very spicy but has a nice mixture of spices."
4,"I love to go to Bandera to start my evening off.  I've had there dinners in the past, but the most memorable food item there is their Dip Duo with Tortilla chips and their yummy Mojitos.  Bandera is a cool place to start off the night with a good appetizer and a strong drink."
4,"My best friend came in to Vegas for the day to visit. I wanted to take her to the new hotels to see how amazing they are. We decided to have lunch and a couple cocktails here after checking the menu out.\nWe shared the grilled vegetable pizza and I had my own cocktail concoction made (Grey goose, water, lime & mint)...YUMMY! I loved how they can or will make any cocktail you want. My friend had their house margarita on the rocks and loved it so much she had 3...hey, she was on vacation!\nThe service was good and the views outside were stunning!"
4,"This is a good place for Dim Sum, just at the edge of the Montreal China Town.  Although the placement inside a mall is not the most scenic or engaging, the food is good and the atmosphere is appropriate for a Dim Sum place.  The dishes tend towards the greasy, but that isn't so unusual for Dim Sim.  \n\nSeveral people have compared this restaurant to ones elsewhere; I've had Dim Sum in Shanghai a few times, and for me this place compares well.  A more detailed comparison with a specific restaurant versus a city or country is silly since Shanghai, for example, has both good places and awful ones, and it's a subjective issue.  What I really want to find it a good authentic Chinese steamed bun (xiaolongbao) restaurant in Montreal (something like Din Tai Fung)."
4,"Setting - Good setting, very nice and relaxed with plenty fo room.\n\nService - Friendly service and always happy to help you make your choice.\n\nFood - Very, very good. This place knows how to do a steak and me and my two friends agreed it was some of the best we'd ever had. I'd avoid the mushroom side though as, to me, it was one of the most vile things I'd ever tasted, though I guess that could just be me.\n\nOverall - Go here if you want a good steak at a good price with good service. Do not miss!!!!"
4,"Ok so I love Thai food. This place was also voted Best of Las Vegas a few times in the past few years. There are 2 things certain here. One. It's a popular place. Two. It's Thai food. Real Thai food. I like they have specials off the menu. I enjoy a lot of different things here from the Pad Thai, the red curry with numba 10 spicy. Their mint beef is pretty good too.  Mmmmm.....Their Thai Iced tea is not overly sweet. The staff is friendly and the cost is average. It's a very nice atmosphere. Overall, it's more of an \""upscale style\"" thai restaurant. Don't eat during lunch at Buffet. You will be disappointed. Have dinner!"
4,It is always good to see a business do it the right way and get rewarded for doing so. This restaurant does it the right way. My wife and I both had the Cobb Salad for lunch - it was excellent. \n\nThis location has seen a couple of restaurants come and go - with good reason. They all had issues. Toast is showing that the location was not the issue - the issue was the product - as it usually is.\n\nVery nice. I didn't give it 5 stars because at one point it was too noisy to actually talk across the table. That might just be a bi-product of their success (they were packed) but it is still an issue.
4,"I've probably shopped here 10 times in the last 2 years and have always had great service and I really enjoy the selection of women's running and beer-drinking, uh....I mean, yoga clothes.  If I have a return or exchange it's always been taken care of quickly and with a smile.  No complaints."
4,"GET THE KOBE SLIDERS. They are so amazing. I crave them all the time. I've never had better ones then here. They come with a BBQ dipping sauce too. MMMM.\n\nThe wait is ridiculous for this place the weekend for lunch though. Don't even try to sit outside. It looks so pretty out there though. There is a pool and some fountains to look at. \n\nThere is a full bar also which is good, but what doesn't have a full bar in vegas? \n\nI've also had the cobb salad, which was GIANT (You could totally share this with 3 people), the chili (so good), Turkey club (good), and a cheese burger(GIANT and yummy). The prices are high, but you get good quality food so I don't mind paying for it!"
4,"Vdara is a quiet oasis in the madness of the Strip with large rooms, great service, and lovely amenities. \n\nI've stayed here twice while in Vegas and enjoyed myself each time. The rooms are some of the largest I've ever stayed in. Easy for the three of us who were sharing this last visit. The entire place is non-smoking and doesn't have a casino so it's very serene.\n\nThe location is on the southern end of the strip and is a little isolated back behind Cosmopolitan. It's a bit of a walk to get to the Strip, and they certainly didn't make it convenient to walk to Cosmo, but getting to Bellagio is very simple.\n\nI guess I like a little more energy when I'm staying in Vegas, but catering to a more calm demographic will keep this hotel nice for a long time. Even the pool was pretty calm compared to a lot of other Vegas pools.\n\nI'd easily stay here again, especially since it's so easy to figure out when this hotel is the \""mystery\"" hotel on Hotwire. Just look for a south strip, five-star, non-casino hotel and most likely it will be Vdara!\n\nHope to see you again soon, Las Vegas!"
4,"I went to AAP last week for lunch because I was too late for Greek Isles, but I am so glad I did!  I eat a late lunch so there was not too many people there and the hostess let me pick my table, so I took a big comfy booth.  \n\nMy server came by right away and got my drink order and to see if I had any questions about the menu.  I was intrigued by the soft pretzel with beer cheese and she told me how good it was, but also how large.  So I decided to order it and if I was still hungry I'd get something else because she told me the kitchen was pretty quick.  Turns out it was a really great pretzel, the cheese wasn't my fave but the pretzel was so soft with a nice crunchy exterior and served piping hot!  I was a little hungry still so I got the spinach salad and it was also delicious.  It was spinach with tomato, cranberries and feta.  I did think it could use maybe a nut or something for a different texture, but overall a great salad.\n\nIt seems like they have drink specials during the week.  The whole place is huge and I bet it would be a great place to watch a game.  The only reason I went with 4 stars was they should have some more lunch offerings besides the salads/sandwiches, entrees don't start till after 5.  Otherwise, it was great and I will be back!"
4,"Im so glad we yelped this place before we left Vegas. \n\nWe were all pretty much grungy but so were the rest of the people there.. haha. Im sure the owners know why.. it is like five mins away from the strip.. \n\nAnyways! Super friendly owner lady!! She was willing to give us more of other things cuz none of us wanted meatballs. Yay! even though she forgot and messed up my friend's order.. \n\nTasted \""authentic.\"" I put that in quotes because I'm not sure what authentic pho tastes like really but it was different from the regular Korean owned places I'm used to. In any case, even though I prefer Korean owned places I thoroughly enjoyed the pho here. It may have been cuz I was slightly hungover.. but still.. when else would you come here right? (As a non Las Vegas resident). :)) \n\nThe only thing I was a little errrr about was the fact that you have to walk pass the kitchen to get to the bathroom. Eek. I don't like that.. :(("
4,"Let me start my review by saying I was EXTREMELY skeptical of a revolving sushi bar. Fish...revolving, hmm...however! I read all the great reviews and sure enough: Yelpers come though again.\n\nI love going to Teharu. You sit, the food rolls by, it's fun!\n\nI love anything that's well made, tastes great, and is Cheap.\n\nThey have a WIDE variety of items price 1.50-2.50 PER plate. I will upload a picture later to show you just how much you can put down at this place and get away cheaply. (Cuz I can put down some sushi). The beers are huge, the portions filling and it's fresh, which is super important when eating raw fish, no?\n\nIf you're still thinking about it,  JUST GO - With prices at 1.50/2.50 per plate...you can afford to \""try it.\"""
4,"This is our go to location when we are craving a good steak for a good price point! The staff is always really friendly and the place is kept clean every time. We usually get the no butter version of the steak and the veggies, since they offer that here, and it cuts a ton of calories from the meal and still tastes awesome with the seasonings they offer!\n\nThe brown bread they bring out in the beginning of the meal is always tasty and served up warm. The ambiance here is nice, and the booths around the bar area are pretty private if you want a date night out, see if you can be seated there. \n\nOverall: A\nFood is always prepared nicely, they offer healthy choices with great flavor, and staff is friendly!"
4,"Glad to have this restaurant in my neighborhood, the only thing that would make it better for me would be a patio, you know for the dog to come with. Reasonable price, had a great red curry!"
4,Stop here! Buy a block of the dill Havarti and try a bunch of samples. I am sure there will be others that you love :)
4,"Le Petit Moulinsart is a little place located in Vieux Montreal along Rue St Paul. In truth, we probably wouldn't have stopped here except we were looking for a late dinner spot and this was one of the few places that looked promising. The name is derived from a Belgian comic strip, which features a chateau called Moulinsart. As you might guess, the restaurant specializes in Belgian fare, though me and my companions really couldn't discern Belgian food from French food if our lives depended on it.\n\nLPM is really known for their mussels, which are served steamed in a large variety of different broths. We tried 4 different mussel dishes and all were good, but two were excellent. However, because there are so many different flavors, I would recommend just trying anything that sounds good to you. If the flavors sound appealing, you will probably like the mussels.\n\nThey cook enough mussels here that they definitely know what they are doing.  All of the mussels came out plump, tender, and juicy. Complimentary baguettes can be used to sop up the broth. Round off the meal with a nice salad, and you have healthy, delicious meal.\n\nIn my opinion, this place serves the second best mussels I ever had. The top prize still goes to Bertha's in Fells Point, Baltimore."
4,"Very good, greasy, totally only eat once a month food!!!  Everything is fried!  Highly recommend the white trash burger (fried pickle, fried onions, cheese, burger) and their sweet potato fries which are awesome!!!"
4,"The last train station is at SLS, the Lux tower wing where we stayed at, it was easy access for us to get on this train. Bought 24 hour passes, got on the train to get to The Linq, it was so fast and convenient, much better and cleaner than taking taxi. There was barely any people on a Sunday. \n\nI like to take the train during the day, It was a lot of fun for me, just need to remember to wear flats next time!"
4,"A bright an airy atmosphere beckons you in at the corner of Saint-Laurent and Fairmount. At lunch, it was a vibe mixed with new moms and bebes, power lunchers, ladies lunching and refined men enjoying a beer. The lunch menu is brief and beautiful. Grilled cheese sandwiches, salads, charcuterie plates on the small half of the sheet; pastas, stews, hash on the larger side. \n\nMy $15 corned beef hash was perfectly topped with a runny sunnyside up egg. Hat tip to the chef - seems to be the toughest egg to master. The corned beef was juicy, yet flaky and melt in your mouth. Overall it looked slight for the price, but with so many rich flavours, it was the right size afterall. As is the trend right now, it was topped with an arugula salad. The spice of it was quite the accompaniment. \n\nMy dining pal had a salad + fries, which our server described as her lunch of choice, nicknamed the \""angel and the devil.\"" The fries, which are served with mayo, are more like pillowy wedges. I was privy to a bite, and then I must admit, I couldn't stop myself, and ate nearly half (gasp!)."
4,"Forget about Starbucks!  I always prefer to patronize local businesses.  Although I prefer to have the \""Bohemian Buzz\"" of the Beehive, Crazy Mocha is an excellent choice too.  They have excellent coffee and teas, smoothies, and desserts.  The only thing I don't like is that some of the desserts are big enough to feed a family of four!  Not good for a diabetic who's sometimes by herself!\n\nThey also have free internet. I can remember when this location was called Dancing Goats.  It has been a few names.  I think it was called \""Sip\"" at one time.  Crazy Mocha has since expanded all over the Pittsburgh Area.  I think they now have one at the Carnegie Library too."
4,"Turned the car in for a quick oil change and decided to kill the time watching a movie! The ticket line was quick and easy to navigate. The cashier was friendly and we went from being in line to ticket in hand in no time.\n\nOnce inside the lobby was clean and well-kept. The ticket taker was nice and pointed us in the direction of the theater. We opted to pass on food since we had just eaten, so can't speak to the snack bar area, other than it looked well organized from afar.\n\nTheater itself was in good condition and clean. The seats were in good shape, and although we were in a smaller auditorium, the screen was easy to see the movie on without feeling like you were in an uncomfortable position for viewing.\n\nOverall: A\nGood movie watching experience!"
4,"Swanky bar with good cocktails and clientele meant for people watching and eavesdropping. Did I just say that? Well it's true.  The patrons here provide the entertainment, and make for great stories.  Such as the DB next to us who bought a bottle of Cristal ($800) for 2 Russian chicks and shotgunned it!  Shots of Cristal, never a dull moment in Vegas. To make matters worse, he ordered regular shots AFTER downing the Cristal....ummm, shouldn't that have gone the other way around? \n\nCome here for a great cocktail. I have high standards for drinks and this place was spot on. Can't remember the name of the drink I had but it had maraschino liquor, vodka, rose wine, and garnished with 3 raspberries.  Delicious!  Plus the bartenders are friendly, quick, and know what they're doing, which makes your experience that much better."
4,Great place for a traditional American style and/or Filipino Style breakfast. The wait was reasonable. I recommend the red velvet pancakes.
4,"I hate to say it but I like the store.  I truely believe stores like this are destroy the smaller stores in this town, but that being said...they have a great selection on just about anything outdoors.  The selections are better then REI IMHO.  I believe they are the only store/shop in town that carries SUP gear.  The workers tend to be knowledgable about everything and are not \""snobby\"" like one can find at the smaller shops in town.  They don't really have the super high end gear that one may want, but if you are heavy into a outdoor activity then you already have your favorite shop to shop at...or online.\n\nBasically this place is great for the \""first timer\"" generally."
4,"Wonderful sandwiches at a reasonable price.  Pretty much everything is delicious here, but the #2 triple decker turkey pastrami on rye is great and filling!"
4,Honestly not that bad considering what the other choices were at the airport.  Staff was friendly and efficient and the food came out hot and freshly made.
4,"Definitely a premium hotel and I would challenge anyone to find any problems with their service.  Meeting rooms were well equipped and the hotel wifi actually worked well and delivered high speed.\n\nNot sure I would justify their rates, but I am cheap when it comes to hotels, so I could not help but notice the Marriott right down the street.  : )"
4,"When I can't get my everyday items like Fresh Fruit, Meat, Seafood, and Deli items @ fresh and Easy I go here. Better Selection and good quality at good price. I would do all my shopping here but there are some items that I just really like from fresh and easy that is closer to my house."
4,"Excellent fish! Three if us had Ono sandwich, fish tacos and fish and chips. Small venue with walk-up ordering. Everything is surf boards with a definite Hawaiian feel! The staff are helpful and good wonderful!"
4,"Wife wanted to go to Macayo for their baja burrito, so we went.\n    I had the poblano chile stuffed with chicken , cheese and covered in baja sauce.  It is deep fried in a crispy breading and it was very good. Almost like a chile relleno , but crispier and IMO better\n      . My wife's favorite is chile relleno and by the way she was eying my food , I know she was kicking herself for not taking my suggestion again and ordering this dish, but I gave her a taste anyway , just to tease her. Lol \n     We also had the green tamale bites as an appetizer ,  it came with Baja sauce.           The tamale bites are sweet masa balls that are deep fried and are addicting.. Service was fine.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and taste of the food ,We will be back"
4,"I enjoy this place. Authentic, inexpensive Hawaiian food. It's run by some nice people. The store itself is a bit on the low end side, but I don't think it's meant to be fine dining. Great for a quick Chicken Katsu fix."
4,"Good ol' Safeway!  I really do love this store and this location.  I have tried other places like FnE or the Safeway on McDowell and I always come back to the Osborn locations.  It at times can truly be one stop shopping...from the US Bank, to the pharmacy, to getting basics.  The only thing I hate is that sometimes they dont have coverage on their lines late at night at it can take a long time to check out.\n\nBut their produce cannot be beat, they have certain products that I love always in stock!"
4,"When we arrived at the restaurant they told us it would be a few minutes before our table was ready and we could wait at the bar. No problem. My husband and I ordered drinks and once our table was ready the hostess notified us and was ready to show us to our table. However, she made no offer to have our drinks brought to our table. Not that I was expecting HER to do it but she could've had someone else do it. It's awkward when you're at the bar, have your purse in tow, jacket on and have to carry a martini glass wearing heels to your table. That's my only gripe :)\n\nFood and service thereafter was great. The best thing about this place is that they are completely fine with you splitting an entree. We shared the lobster bisque which they offered to split for us which was great! We then shared the rib eye which was cooked perfectly medium rare and ordered the risotto as a side. The food was really tasty and just the right amount without being overly stuffed. Our waiter and staff were all very good. The waiter even put a rush in for our food since we had a show to catch. Very nice of him."
4,"The Mattress Factory has several buildings of contemporary art, which you can probably spend about an hour and a half here.  \n\nThere are lots of weird and entertaining pieces--strange sounds coming from the front facade of an apartment building, a huge gigantic concrete column, etc.  Shiota's Trace of Memory is an interesting piece--black yarn strewn about like webs throughout an apartment.  James Turrell's pieces are strange--light on a different canvases.   \n\nAdmission is $15, but we used a Buy One, get One Free Admission from visitpittsburgh.com.  (valid until 12/31/13)"
4,"If you ever find yourself down at Newhaven (perhaps not all that likely unless you live there) take the time to pay a visit to Porto and Fi. This wonderful little deli and cafe is the perfect place to have a bite to eat and a cup of tea. When I worked along the road in Granton, my workmate and I used to treat ourselves to lunch here occasionally - 'treat' being the operative word. \n\nThe food here is excellent, they try to locally source as many ingredients as possible and this hard work pays off, even a simple sandwich is delicious. I am a big fan of their cakes and this was the first place to introduce me to the delights of chocolate beetroot cake, I know it sounds like a pretty eccentric combination, but the main ingredients really compliment each other: the chocolate is rich and sweet and the beetroot keeps the sponge moist. \n\nIt can get pretty busy, the Newhaven locals have really bought into this place, so it can mean a bit of a wait for a table, do wait though - it's worth it."
4,Nice find off the beaten path of Mill St. Food was really fresh. Pad thai yummy. Beef salad and spring rolls to start were fresh and hot. Each dish was really good. Would have loved a beer or wine ;-)
4,"We were heading downtown on the lightrail to a D-Backs game and decided to go early and try Sunday brunch at this little cafe just a mile or so north of the stadium. We were greeted by super-friendly servers and were instantly charmed by the decor and set-up. The dining room was full so we sat on the patio. We placed our order at the counter and didn't have to wait more than a few minutes for our drinks. I tried the Melon Mojito- YUM! Our food arrived rather promptly as well and my frittata was delicious as was my boyfriend's pulled pork sandwich. Great service, great food, cute atmosphere. I definitely recommend this place for brunch or lunch!"
4,"**Free Wifi** wins my heart every time. There aren't many charging stations but there are plenty of rocking chairs. I've been here a few times and I always enjoy my short layover here. There are a lot of Starbucks scattered throughout so have no fear, plenty of java here."
4,Ask for waiter tommy he is awesome!! Gigi is always friendly!!! Such a good variety of menu options!! I would like to see their happy hour selections have more variety and more items. The Lotus Roll is the best in town.
4,"Great happy hours, great service if you lucky to get Aaron and a place to be suggested.\nThanks for being in business for such a long time."
4,"Very, very good donuts.  If you're on a diet have just one... and when you start to feel guilty about it have another to remind yourself why it was all worth it."
4,"Boy, we had fun here.  Food was slow coming, but obviously was made to order.  Best lentils I've ever had.  Plantains were amazing.  Beef was a bit dry, but very flavorful.  Eclectic menu, and I look forward to trying more items.  The owner? gentleman, server was very friendly and helpful.  Great choice for lunch or dinner."
4,"Great carne asada chimi, combo #20, crispy and flavorful.  Lots of Guacamole too.  The staff were laughing and singing in the back, great place and I will be back!"
4,"I have stayed at the South Point several times while staying in Vegas. It is a bit off of the Strip (which means less traffic), but it is all inclusive, so unless you are actually looking for the Strip, you don't need to go anywhere. \n\nThey've got bowling, bingo, movie theater, (obviously a Casino), several great restaurants, and the list goes on.  I saw a betting place too, but that's not my thing.\n\nOne of my personal favorites is the daily Texas Hold Em tournament.  I have won it a few times, and it's a decent priced buy in ($55?)\n\nIt is one of the newer properties as well so it is still kind of clean.\n\nOn one of our visits, they were doing some maintenance and we didn't get the memo that there would be a power outage in the middle of the night.  If I didn't wear a CPAP (sleep apnea device) I wouldn't have even noticed.\n\nThe rooms are very affordable and if you get on their email list and join their players club, you will be invited back at even lower rates (and you don't have to be a big spender to get the discounts).\n\nFor a reasonable priced Vegas hotel, it is at the top of my list."
5,"I have moved around the country quite a bit in the last three years from Seattle to Hawaii - Michigan and back to Seattle again. Everywhere I go I look for that special place that doesn't scream St#+%%cks and yet delivers great coffee with outstanding service. Here are my findings so far: Maui - Honolulu Coffee Co. Ann Arbor - The Common Cup, Ypsilanti - The Ugly Mug, Bellingham, WA - The Black Drop, Lettered Streets, Firehouse, and Tony's Coffee, Seattle (So Far) - Vivace Espresso and now in Phoenix - Lux Coffee Bar.\n\nUpon entering the coffee bar you greeted with a smooth ultra urban vibe that is not pretentious, arrogant, nor fake. The service is outstanding, the bakery/deli products are amazing and delicious. The beans are hand roasted in the 'Employee Lounge' and are made into the perfect caramel shots poured into the perfectly stretched milk from a very talented barista. \n\nI know the LUX doesn't need one more review, but I must say that the cool vibe, the fantastic coffee, and the great spaces make for a coffee shop that I might just book a flight to Phoenix from Seattle to visit. \n\nLUX has it dialed in...trust me!"
5,I was brought here by some friends and co workers. I haven't ever been here and I must say it was perfect. This place was very friendly and very delicious. The shanty was my favorite drink. I highly recommend the chicken mole.
5,"The best pizza in Pittsburgh, hands down.  6 stars for the pizza, n/a for the other food, 4-star decent beer selection for the size of the place, 2 star for the prices, 5 stars for the owner, 2 stars for the employees/service, 5 stars for timeliness. When it comes down to it I rate take-out and delivery places mostly based on food taste because I am not going elsewhere for superior service and inferior food, so Graziano's gets 5 stars by my standards. I have friends who visit from out of town who order it to take home. It's that good. Don't be fooled by the single slices though, as it seems they use a different recipe for them (they kinda suck). Go for the large plain or extra cheese. Perfecta!"
5,"My girlfriend lives just a few blocks away from this place.  We eat here maybe 3-5 times a month.  Always great service and the food is a top notch.  If you've been to Zipps, well it's the same thing because Goldie's was the first!  You won't be disappointed."
5,"One of the most memorable restaurants, since my future husband to be proposed to me here, since we were in Vegas to celebrate our 5 year anniversary.  We sat next to the window and was able to watch the Bellagio water show and see the sunset.  \n\nWe ate the sauteed pork chop and Filet Mignon which was delicious everything was soft and was not over cooked. The finance tried a mojito and I drank the berry champagne, which was also good.\n\nThe waiter even help set up my fiance's proposal, I was already crying when the dessert came out.  Another customer from another table saw my fiance propose to me and told me to stop crying and bought us two glasses of champagne. How lucky were we! \n\nAgain one of the most memorable restaurant, I would definately come back here every time I visit Las Vegas."
5,"A great local coffee, beer and wine cafe that is owned by Catholic Charities, so patronizing this establishment supports local refugee programs. Local art, jewelry and crafts done by refugees are also featured and available to purchase. \n\nThe atmosphere is inviting and comfortable. The coffee and teas are outstanding and are roasted/made right here in Phoenix. The food is sourced with local ingredients and made fresh. I highly recommend the pulled pork sandwich and the the tuna sandwich. The fresh salsa and chips and salad are both tasty side options. Actually, everything I have eaten here has been good! \n\nThey have a nice private meeting room in back and right now they have a local \""Promote Your Talent Showcase\"" the 2nd and 4th Tuesday of the month featuring various local musicians and vocalists in an intimate setting. \n\nI suggest that you stop by and try out this great new establishment that is focused on supporting local community."
5,"This was my first visit with Select Auto and I will definitely be back! All the employees were friendly and attentive and have great customer service. The last time my car was in the shop for an insurance collision repair, it took almost 5 weeks and Select Auto had my car done in a week. They called me and updated me on the status of the car and even called my insurance for me to extend my rental. They dropped me off at my rental car and took the rental car back for me!  I wouldn't expect a body shop to care much about their decor so I was pleasantly surprised with their office enviornment! Its clean, trendy and definitely has that uptown central phx hipster feel. Great experience!! :)"
5,"It's a big venue.  Seats about 5-7 thousand I'm guessing.  There are some lounge n food areas.  It's beautiful...  They have great, big named Christian artist concerts.  Their sports are great games n monsoon/havoc section are a huuuuuge support! :)"
5,This is my go to for good East Coast pizza. I've dined in and ordered out for pick up numerous times.  Consistently the same great quality. If you know good pizza you will not be disappointed!!!
5,"This place is right by my job. My coworker and I have either gone here or ordered from here (yes, they deliver!) 5 times in the last two weeks. That's when we discovered this little gem. The service is just as good as the food is. Reasonably priced food, great quality and flavor. Plus, they have a frequent diner card.\n\nThe sweet potato fries are awesome and so are the sweet potato tots. \n\nI'd also recommend the blackened mahi mahi. But, the signature sliders have been my absolute favorite. Then again, I've enjoyed everything I've had there. \n\nThis is definitely my go-to lunch spot. There aren't many places where you can grab a great lunch and be in and out in under an hour."
5,"My wife and I decided to attempt to conquer camelback mountain and we did. It's a very rough course with many steep hikes. I was able to complete it in Nike running shoes, this might I add, I do not suggest. Only because it can be slippery at times when coming down. I suggest getting there early too. The park doesn't open until sunrise but we got there at 5:30am and it opened 15 mins later. There was atleast 8-10 cars behind us waiting also. This was a Monday morning. If you begin your hike after 8pm it tends to get a little too hot I would imagine. We started around 6 got to the top around 730 or so and completed the hike down by 9. It's a good hike up and down. I loved it tho."
5,"Food is great, service is great!! What more could you ask for....well maybe less of a wait would be nice. But let's be honest, the reason you wait is because everyone loves it!! My favorite menu items are the BC Sandwich and the Bird omelette and my husband swears by the Eggs Benedict. This is our favorite place for Sunday brunch!!"
5,Went there for breakfast. Was a welcome relief after driving thru Cave Creek and no other breakfast places to eat. Great friendly service and great food. Like the portions and left there feeling good. Well priced. I will be back.
5,"I saw a review that likened Gadzooks to Chipotle.  As I made it through the line and their staff assembled my lunch, I can see how that comparison can be made - in process alone.  \n\nI love that they have limited items on the menu (basically, enchilada, taco, tortilla soup) but then there's an option explosion for what you put in them.  I had a green chili pork enchilada and a bison enchilada.  Both were terrific. It was the best bison I've ever had, in fact.  The house-smashed guacamole was delicious also.\n\nI thought I was smart by getting there at 11:30 (avoiding the noon rush) but they were already very busy.  I got the last parking space and the next to last interior table.  Thankfully the tables seemed to turn quickly and the line moved in the same way.  There are misters on the patio if that's your only course of action.   \n\nI will certainly come back and I'll bring friends."
5,"My wife and I were relocating from San Fransisco, and was in need to find the highest quality real estate group in the Scottsdale area due to a very short timeline to relocate.  After viewing some other great reviews and researching The Hill Group's website, I knew that I found the right people to help us with our first home purchase.  I am so impressed with everyone that I was in contact within THE HILL GROUP specifically STEVEN JAMES (480) 980-7656. The professionalism and drive that Steven had to find us a house that we loved was fantastic. He may not have known this (maybe he just didn't show it), but we are very hard to please. His main goal was to find us a house that we were in love with, and we did just that. Steven I am so thankful that we picked you to help us with this step in our lives. Steven, I wish you the best of luck with everything that you do with your career. Thank you so much!"
5,"I think from reading the other reviews that I might have caught them on a really good day.  Coffee was excellent, service prompt, chili perfectly piquant, and the decor was upscale and fun without being pretentious.  As a former New Yorker, I've had my fair share of crepes and felt that the Caprese that I ordered was well prepared and tasty and kind of enjoyed having a moderately priced, moderately upscale little gem across from the children's hospital.  This is where I'll take my clients when I'm in town.  Not too noisy, not too pricey, friendly, fast, and fresh."
5,"Excellent care. The teams in A 3 are Top Shelf. From the cleaning crew to aides to nurses to room service to midnight vampires to doctors, everyone was fabulous. Always cheerful, kind, warm, gentle hands and hearts and good ear."
5,"Pros:\n- Open 24 hours.\n- Cheaper than other foods at Vegas.\n- Open 24 hours.\n- Delicious\n\nCons:\n- Lines can be long (because they are open 24 hours) but they move fairly quickly.\n\nI would say this is a MUST VISIT for all Vegas go-ers. It is the perfect remedy for hunger, drunken munchies, or Vegas on a budget."
5,"Working with Eric and his crew was such a pleasure.  We love, love, love our yard now. Eric came up with a great design and the follow thru was perfect.  The one small problem of  one of the lights not working was addressed right away.  Couldn't be more pleased and would highly recommend this company."
5,Got an awesome grand opening deal on tires here! Big Rob is the man and delivered AWESOME customer service. Free water and Starbucks coffee. This place is great!
5,"Every good thing you read here is right. UH MAZ ING. \n\nOnly thing I can add is the guac based green salsa is the best thing ever. We had it in Austin, TX and they either called it green salsa or Salsa Dona. It is really hot but worth it. Go now. Go often. Go again. \n\nOnly negative is that I wish it was about 5 times bigger to accommodate everyone."
5,"Medusa is a great local hairdressing chain - there are two salons in Edinburgh's city centre and a third in Musselburgh. In addition to hairdressing, the salons also do nails and have beauty services.\n\nThe Teviot salon has a vibrant atmosphere and seems to buzz like a hive of activity; when I visited (on a Thursday evening) each one of the seven or so hairdressing stations had a client at it. This is obviously a popular place, however I managed to get an appointment at relatively short notice (big thumbs up for this). The stylist gave me a thorough consultation and I felt like she really listened to me and understood what I wanted in terms of cut and style, her friendly and chatty manner put me instantly at ease. Once I'd been shampooed and sat in front of the mirror, I was almost immediately offered a tea or coffee (again, big thumbs up), and the coffee was real (i.e. not Nescafe instant rubbish) and came with a biscuit. I left the salon feeling great; I'd been looked after really well and given a fantastic haircut\n\nI really can't fault this place: it is trendy and modern, while also managing to be friendly and professional."
5,came here on a vacation.. and all i can say is that this is probably one of the best buffet i went to in my life! i been to a lot of buffets.. trust me..\n\nthis place is classy.. everything and everyone there is very nice and professional..\n\nall the food is just outstanding! i cant even describe it.. if you haven't been there.. you are missing out.. all the food is prepped nicely like those very expensive high end restaurants except this is a buffet! \n\ni haven't come across anything i dislike there.. cant wait to come back on my next vacation!!!
5,We ordered a cake for our son's wedding in September. William was very helpful and professional.  The cake was so beautiful and delicious that we ordered another cake for my husband's 50th birthday celebration.  Once again the cake was a hit! Delicious moist vanilla cake with raspberry mousse filling.
5,"This is the Cathedral of Meat. This is where animals are slaughtered for me to worship. This is where I count my blessings and relish the idea that I am a true carnivore. I won't even mention that this place has the best salad bar in the country. The focus of this review is the MEAT. \n\nHot smoking marinated meat served at the flip of my green light.  I must say that I will never really enjoy a good steak again. This place has it down to a science. As a steak lover, I've always enjoyed the burnt salty end of a steak combined with the pink medium rare interior. After that first bite, the steak is never as good as the first bite because it cools down on your plate. BUT Texas de Brazil has it down to  a science. I get to enjoy burnt fatty medium rare top sirloin that's served hot with every order. Hallelujah! \n\nAll the other types of meat are good but the show stopper this the top sirloin. I just wish I have two stomachs instead of one...."
5,"Both of our kids inherited our old iPhone 4 phones and the batteries wouldn't hold a charge anymore. These guys replaced both phone's batteries in about 5 minutes for WAY less than apple wants to charge for battery replacement!\n\nFast, friendly and extremely reasonable price!\n\nHighly recommend and I would use them again in a second."
5,"I had a couple of elective surgeries completed by Transformations (Dr. Siebert). The staff is amazing, and worked with me even though I lived in NYC and was traveling to Wisconsin for surgery. (Wisconsin was far more cost effective, approx. 1/3 the cost of NYC). I could not be happier with the results and would recommend this facility to anyone."
5,"Great college restaurant.  Sat outside on State St for a great atmosphere and good, tasty food.  Never had African food before but will certainly try again when I come across another place serving it.  Definitely give this place a try!"
5,"There is no better venue in all of pro football than Heinz Field. Great site lines to field topped off with incredible history donned inside the Great Hall. What other stadium has all of their Super Bowl trophies on display next to a Hall of Famer's fake teeth (Jack Lambert). \n\nAll that, AND they have Primanti Bros available inside the stadium. Oh yeah, I almost forgot this is the best tailgating spot in all of pro sports. Do yourself a favor, make the pilgrimage to Pittsburgh for a Steelers game."
5,"Kool-Aid that is ice cold, Perfectly fried chicken and golden waffles...what more that one need in life??  This place was amazing!  I can not wait to go again!!"
5,"I went this past weekend for my 21st birthday. WOOHOO finally! I must say this hotel is super convenient for those celebrating their 21st becasue it is the center of all the main clubs that are worth checking out. Venetian is the home to TAO and its sister hotel Palazzo has Lavo. These two clubs play all the right dancing music and has just enough space for you to dance. \n\nOh about the rooms. I loved our room becuase it has just enough space for about 6-8 poeple to fit and sleep comfortably. In the room we got, we had 2 queen/full beds and one pull out couch bed. We had 6 girls and everyone slept comfortably. The double door bathroom is almost big enough to fit all of us girls and the many mirrors in teh hotel room made it easy for all of us to get ready at the same time. \n\nOverall the venetian is a good place to stay if you are here to club, eat, and shop! i'm sure the gambling is good as well, but i wouldn't know cause i lost all my free slot play in about 1 minute. \n\nOH also, it rained MONEY$$ in TAO as me and my girlfriends were leaving, which made is why i gave venetian 5 stars instead of 4.5.!!!"
5,We got here right before it closed and I was worried it would not be as good at the end of the day... BOY was I wrong!! The salad was so cold and fresh the garlic knots..Well let's just say bring me another round!!! and the Pizza was excellent.. We will only go here for pizza from now on!!
5,"Every other hotel we called was full up from last night (at 6:00AM). We needed to find a room and FAST! They could get us a room before noon (which beat the 3pm check in others were offering). They let us help ourselves to the continental breakfast and hang by the pool until our room was ready. Fast, friendly service, definitely looking out for the best interest of the customers (unlike EVERY SINGLE HOTEL ON THE STRIP) -- It is about a mile off the strip, but there's a shuttle to take you there and back until 10:30PM and after that, it's an easy walk with a friend, kitty corner form Hard Rock Cafe. Very clean rooms with amazing pullout couches. VERY REASONABLY PRICED! If you're looking for service and quiet and a peaceful getaway (still close to the strip) THIS IS THE PLACE TO BE!"
5,"You can only understand if you have been there.  The best Asian food ever.  The service makes you feel like you are a MILLION DOLLAR PLAYER.  The ambiance, the view, and the people are amazing!!!!!!"
5,"I used to swear by Buffalo Wild Wings, until my girlfriend introduced me to Wing Stop.  While they might have less of a selection when it comes to flavors of wings don't hold that against them.  The Wings are awesome, I have tried BWW a few times since eating at Wing stop and they just don't compare."
5,"For anyone not made of money, it's natural to resist the upscale, crunchy appeal of Whole Foods Market. There I sat in my cubicle, wondering where to eat lunch day after day, not even considering the large grocery store just a short walk away from my office. Then my girlfriend started mentioning all of the great deals on healthy foods she was finding at Whole Foods on her lunch breaks and curiosity slowly crept into my gastronomical musings.\n\nThen one day I made the leap and have not regretted it since. Granted, I'm not saying this place is cheap, but you definitely get what you pay for. And the amount of food offerings are vast. There's a BBQ smokehouse place in the back with $5 lunch deals, a Chipotle-like burrito bar, a bar with happy hour specials, a brick oven pizzeria, a crazy awesome salad bar ($2 off per pound on wednesdays), an Asian cuisine kitchen, and a bevy of pre-made dishes that are probably better than anything your mom could ever dream of making.\n\nI haven't done much actual grocery shopping here because, again, it's pricey, but if you're looking for a quality, healthy dining experience then this is the place to go.\n\nAlso, the people watching at the Scottsdale location is incredible. It's like a carnival of stereotypes and then some."
5,"The hype is well deserved, you guys. Nicest curb in town, I say. Wifey and I parked there last week. I had the street side. She had the curb side (as usual lol). She loved it! Hey, don't mess with a good thing, I guess. You like what you like, amirighr?\nAnywho, Aaron's was just a darn HOOT. I give it TWO kitten's whiskers up."
5,"If you are visiting Las Vegas, this is a great way to start things off! Marcy is so talented at making your eyebrows look their greatest and only for $10 and it is painless!!! She also offers many services to make you look as glamorous as possible for Vegas style partying ; ) \n\nIf you are local and have the luxury of visiting her a few times a month, you should! She has transformed my eyebrows into a work of art! \n\nAs if her talent wasn't enough-- the ambiance here is amazing. It is so clean, comfortable and friendly. They make you feel at home and their place has great energy!"
5,"It's exactly what I'd expect for an old school Mexican food place. Yeah, it's cramped a little. It's old. The food is the best Mexican food for white people in Phoenix. The hot sauce is to die for. Chips and fresh and endless. I love the gringo Fundito. If you're thinking about eating at this place, stop thinking and start getting down there to get a seat. It can get crowded very quickly. End of story."
5,"This is my very favorite sushi restaurant ever! The Kanji roll is amazing! Yung is the BEST sushi chef in Vegas, there is NO competition or comparison. Ji is a great owner, very involved in making sure the customer always has the best experience. Every member of the Kanji family has always been so catering and so welcoming to me and my friends. Top notch food, service and amazing staff, thank you Kanji!"
5,"I honestly feel that the people who leave negative reviews for these guys are just frustrated that they have old cars and can not afford to fix them. The staff all the way from the guys at the front (I deal with Ramon) to the mechanics are always very nice and to me.\n\nI recently sold my BMW M6 but German Motors always serviced it. They always have the best prices and had my car out by the end of the day. When I thought I needed new brakes ($1,200+ job) because they were making some noise, they lifted my car up, inspected my rear brakes, and said they were fine but since they are so large, they make some noise in the Vegas heat. They charged me $0 for the inspection and I bought all the guys lunch ($50) as a thank you.\n\nI just brought my 1967 Mustang in to bleed the brakes and recharge the a/c (3-4 hour job) and my bill was $330 after taxes. You cant really beat that...\n\nOn top of everything else, the guys always give me a ride to and from my building for free (you always should tip $5-$10 in my opinion) when I don't have my car. Now that's customer service... A+++  \n\nDaniel H."
5,"I got a chance to take a sneak peak into The Lady Silvia during a globe salon event.  All I can say is that we need more places like this in Las Vegas! \n\nIt is located on the bottom floor of the Soho Lofts downtown.  There is an unmarked door that leads you thru a small dark hallway.  There is another door that leads you to the bar.  It is beautiful inside, with checkered floors that are flanked by tall bookshelves full of books.  It is dark inside, there is a DJ booth and graffiti on the ceiling.  It is unpretentious and tucked away- so refreshing to have in Las Vegas.  Once this opens up, I will be here frequently."
5,"I am lucky enough to live right around the corner from this CenPho favorite and it is truly one of the best things about living in Central Phoenix. This is a great place to bring out of town guests for a unique Phoenix experience- not at all your typical chain restaurant food. I don't think I have ever had anything there that wasn't above my expectations. I have gone for special occasions, out of towners, or just lunch with friends. Any time of day is great and the food is consistently awesome. The sweet potaoe fries rock and my all time fave is the lobster quesadilla's- yummm!\n\nCan't say enough good stuff about this local fave."
5,"Love this place!!  I like their taro with boba snoh the best, and you can go wrong with any of the glazes.  Some of the snohs are really sweet so you have to be careful to pair them with less sweet toppings unless you have an intense sweet tooth.  I've only had their boba once but it was fantastic.  Recently I went with a big group of people that were not familiar with the flavors and they stayed with safe things (fruit snoh with chocolate toppings) but they also loved it.  \n\nIn addition, workers are always friendly and helpful, and most will give you samples if they have time.  They play cool indie music usually, have cool art on the walls and have a nice artsy nerd vibe. They have Jenga and some other games, so it's a nice place to just chill and eat/drink something delicious."
5,It was our first time here and we're very welcomed by Marty who served up an amazing lunch and dining experience! A very quaint place with amazing dishes! The meatballs were outstanding!
5,"We have lived in the SW valley for 13 years, and have been looking for a good, fair mechanic for about as long.  My search has ended.  Phil is personable, knowledgeable, and runs a business like it should be run.  I had brake issues, every time I stepped on the brakes it was \""brake and shake\"".  I knew it was unsafe and did not want my teenagers driving it.  Phil and his team got the job done on time and on budget.  I love working with a \""Mom and Pop\"" business."
5,"This is the second location in South End for Lark & Key (and will be the only one after April 2011). The original location is in NoDa. The main owners, Duy Huynh and Sandy Snead, showcase their acrylic paintings and jewelry and offer their gallery to other artists and their works as well (e.g., pottery, paintings, jewelry and accessories).\n\nThe employees are always friendly.\n\nI really enjoy stopping in and fantasizing about my next purchase! You can easily throw down a lot of cash in this place and it's worth every penny."
5,"Great little shop! Very clean and they do an awesome job! The staff is very friendly and they make sure you are satisfied. I got lucky and they weren't busy when I came in, but since it's small - I'd recommend calling for an appointment first! I found this little gem on Yelp as I was driving through, very glad I stopped."
5,"Love this place. I was craving some ramen and decided to yelp a place. I am so glad I did. Not only was the broth yummy, the prices were reasonable.\n\nI got the miso ramen. Full of flavor and they have lots of noodles.\n\nMy hubby got the pork belly bowl. He really enjoyed it. The pork flavor was spot on.\n\nWe got an order of fried rice, that was ok. \n\nOverall good food, good service. The place is small, but I can look past it because it was so good!"
5,"great breakfast- generous portions and a friendly cook(Nikki). the customers are all friendly and you do not \""dine alone\"" here. The cooking is home style and hot. it is compact and if you need any thing -the person next to you will surely pass it over to you\npeter"
5,"Took the opportunity to have a donut this morning.  My DH and I stopped by and not big donut consumers we were impressed with the fresh tasty's donuts.  They are amazing warm.  We had a Bavarian Cream, Snickers, chocolate and raspberry filled.  They were all really good.  The staff was friendly and inviting.  Would recommend if you are looking for a sweet fix."
5,"Fast, professional, courteous (nice!), fair prices, super fast service.\n\nWe needed rush business cards that didn't look like we printed them ourselves. We first went to the Fedex at Mandalay Bay and although they were speedy, nice, and convenient, their same-day business cards are on really flimsy paper stock. Not suitable at all.\n\nI called around for another same-day business card service, one that delivered, and decided on Franklin because they gave a considered, reasoned response to my initial query. My fault that we couldn't get them the same day because I turned in the artwork too late, but they delivered to us at the hotel by 10am the next morning. Note that if your order is under a certain minimum, they charge $35 or something like that for delivery, but we were happy to pay.\n\nEverybody I dealt with--Kerry, Michele, Mike--was extremely nice, professional, and knowledgeable. They took time to understand what I needed and when, and they were responsible, communicative, and good at their respective jobs.\n\nAnd they came through with rush, delivered, good-looking business cards!  Huzzah!"
5,"Had a wonderful experience. Great selection of beer, good happy hour menu. Burgers are exceptional, haven't had a burger so good in long time. Everything from the bun to the topping tasted and looked fresh. Will definitely be back soon!"
5,"Working with Rosemary is super easy. I came in with a very modest budget for flowers ($200) and we were able to work with it. Bridal bouquets, bridesmaids, and boutanneires. she's a pro, and I would highly recommend. Also! They are open late, which is AWESOME for people like me who work in Scottsdale and live downtown. Thanks guys! I'll report back again with photos once I get hitched ;)"
5,"If Schwartz was an institution, I'd sign myself in voluntarily every single day!\n\nWhat can I say about this place that most of you don't already know?  It's a jewel of Montreal, arguably the best smoked meat in all of Canada if not the east side of the continent!\n\nLine ups are abound year round, especially during the summer and long weekends.  Here's a tip: don't go in large groups, go as a couple or threesome, it allows you to skip the line faster.  \n\nThe smoked meat here is delicious, absolute heaven to taste into.  When you order your sandwich, ask for fatty meat for the most flavour, also order a side of coleslaw, pickles and a cherry pop to complete your Schwartz experience.\n\nBut most of all, say hello to the patrons you'll be nestled in tightly with in the communal tables.  \n\nOn your way out, be sure to stop next door to get a pound, or two to go!  I always do!\n\nThis place is a must visit for every single visitor to Montreal because nowhere else does smoked meat like they do!"
5,"I always see the food trucks on campus, but didn't buy any food. I was always a little skeptical about food trucks. Am I glad I threw that out the window?! Yes! A friend and I stop by in between classes because they said they love vegetarians, and I was hoping they had something good and tasty. The guy at the register let me know of different options that I could order without meat. There were 4  guys working and they were super cool and cracked me up here and there. \n\nI ordered the Greenwich as a salad and not sandwich. It was so good! The avocado ranch dressing made the salad along with the caramelized onions, melted swiss, huge tomato slices and toasted bread. I also ordered waffle fries with cajun seasoning which were bomb as well. My plan was to eat half then, save the rest for later. Did that happen? No. The food was too good to stop. And you can't beat the price. I ordered the salad with fries and a drink and the was the best $10 spent.\n\nI'll be back to order more and indulge!"
5,I love stopping here for the Studio B Buffet! \n\nHotel is very clean and i am looking forward to one day staying here at their resort. They have a cute cupcake shop and a Hash House A Go Go as well.
5,This hotel earned a 5 star yelp review from me and my family. Not one complaint very high end. Will definitely stay there again!
5,"If you look at my other reviews you will see I know my stuff when dealing with cars and shops.  I have taken my car here twice to have the alignment done.  They do a great job and make sure everything is all good.  The only time I take one of my cars to a shop is if it is under warranty or if it needs something that I can't do.  Well I don't own and alignment machine!  I have chatted with everyone that works there and they are all good people and easy to get along with, but most importantly they will not rip you off and will do whats right by you and your car."
5,"This place has the best coffee ever!! It's a little pricey for the large drinks but the regular size is bigger than a venti at Starbucks.\n\nMy friends got the Carmel vanilla blended drink, my other friend got the regular iced coffee and I got the triple chocolate mocha. All three drinks were so delicious! The favorite ended up being the Carmel vanilla.\n\nThis is our new spot on the west side."
5,"If you like bruschetta, you'll love this place! I love the roasted red pepper and the prosciutto is good too! This use to be the go-to spot on Wine Wednesdays for happy hour for my friends and I. The outdoor seating area is fun when it isn't too hot, and they have live music sometimes too! Love!"
5,"OUTSTANDING food and ambiance-- Had the proscuitto pizza and it was to die for. \n\nThe Limoncello was fantastic, too! Definitely a trendy spot to check out in downtown Phx"
5,Great environment with good service and excellent pizza.. Reasonably priced with indoor and outdoir eating including a full bar.From the salads to pizza excelkent food. A popular restaurant and for good reason..A++
5,"I've been to Fuego Bistro twice, both times the food was amazing!  Try a mojito with the Pernil Asado, you won't be disappointed.  The restaurant is small, and the staff is very friendly, they seemed to know a lot of their customers by name."
5,Joe Filter is a easy way to order my home air filters online. I highly recommend checking out their webiste at www.Joefilter.com. It was simple and inexpensive to purchase my filters.
5,"Oh. My. Gosh. Go here! Tex mex omelette was the best thing ever. Salsa, guac, chorizo, sour cream.. Seriously I died and went to heaven. Their bread is like thick Texas toast or something, to die for. And their potatoes--seriously amazing. And the price is so legit. Not expensive at all. My boyfriend got something with pancakes and they were like crepe style pancakes and he was drooling over them. So awesome. \nAnd the service was great. Our server was friendly and I honestly think the food came out faster than it would at an actual fast food place. To some that may seem weird but when I'm hungry I hate waiting so it was awesome for us!\nIt is kinda of a small place. And it is cash only. So keep that in mind. But please get breakfast here ASAP. \nOh, they do have some lunch items as well but their menu is on the small side in general."
5,"Efficient and quick service from airport to city centre.\n\nBiggest known secret to locals - you get to city center for \u00a33 in 20 mins or less. Runs every 10 mins.  It dropped me off at the city centre next to the Caledonian and the Sheraton Grand hotel, but it can stop at the Waverly station.\n\nAlso, it also goes to the Zoo from the city centre in about 8 minutes. \n\nExcellent, timely service. Friendly, efficient, convenient. All for \u00a33 each way. Yes way! Thank you Airlink."
5,"Just a note... if you go to the drive thru and tell them that you're eating in your car, they'll give you an open box instead of a bag.  They even offer a placemat!  Sweet!"
5,"Unbelievable hidden gem of a sushi bar tucked in a strip mall at the SW corner of Dysart and McDowell.  We absolutely love this place and think it is quite possibly one of the best sushi options in the entire Valley.\nWe've introduced several friends to it, and all of them are shocked that a restaurant this good is in the West Valley.\nTheir sashimi is always top notch, their drink specials great, and their selection of rolls are too many to mention.  We especially love the ninja jalapeno appetizer and the Double Double and Cactus rolls."
5,The best.  Simply fantastic.  Definitely going back.\n\nOnly open a few hours a week but do yourself a favor and sync your schedule with there's and get down there.
5,"This is a fabulous place!!  Super clean which is always a plus.  I was a walk in and I got in right away no waiting.  The gal that did my pedicure was awesome, she is a perfectionist which I most appreciate. I am going back for my manicure next."
5,"I had the pleasure of trying a new Indian restaurant this weekend called Marigold Maison and had one of the best dining experiences I've had in ages. This little gem is exactly what Phoenix needed! We had a fantastic dinner of seared eggplant, spicy naan and the best Tandoori Shrimp I've had (the prawns were huge and so fresh). We also had a delicious curry dish and a great bottle of white Bordeaux.  I can't wait to go back again and work my way through the menu! Fantastic :)"
5,"I'm totally biased towards this place because (now, don't judge me) I met me husband here.\n\nThe neighborhood is bleh, the decor isn't anything spectacular, and the crowd is sometimes questionable. It's the perfect low-key bar!\n\nThe drink prices are amazing, bartenders are nice, their bar is always stocked with non-well liquors, you can smoke INSIDE, and theres a juke box (usually with someone dancing in front of it alone). They had a Spy On Vegas event here and that's how I met my hubby, but we've come back here numerous times for a casual drink since then. It's a good place to come for a super low-key drink away from the normal see-and-be-seen bars all over town."
5,"For first time in Az,place was an adventure from the parking down the hill (they have shuttles to the restraunt) to the entrace!!! horny! Lol we got there a lil after 5 and it was packed! Great food and service! We ordered all you can eat beef ribs $16.99 didn't even finish the last 1 lots of meat! They start you off w/biscuits yummy-cinnamon butter than salad also yummy. Huge Restraunt! Awesome view!"
5,"I love it here. I moved in April 2014 and it's been a pleasure. Love the night security,  it's always neat; no trash laying around. Love the dog friendly community and diversity of the residents.. It's quiet and the pool is always clean."
5,"The shop was voted as \""The Best Tasting Doughnuts in Las Vegas!\""\n\nI strongly agree. And quite possibly top-5 in the nation. Well, I don't know about that. But if I was a doughnut-judge, I think this Las Vegas Doughnut shop should get some strong consideration. \n\nI was here close to 10am and half the doughnut selections were gone. But no fear; there are plenty of great tasting doughnuts for me. \n\nI had the Apple filled roll and a small cup of coffee for $2.25. The roll is similiar to a Cannelloni with a cinnamon-flavored apple filling. The mixture of the crunchy and flakey sugary crust combine with the apple filling makes this treat very unique. \n\nMy treat: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QDeB3ZtWYzVJJ0KK-HM-PA?select=vl8SV5VpcU7TQnOuMp53FA\n\nI also bought a couple of Glazed Raise for a later treat, but my battery on my camera succumbed on me. Sorry!\n\nBut you definitely don't need my crappy pictures to convince you to check out Las Vegas's best doughnut shop."
5,"The $6.99 lunch buffet is an awesome deal, as the food was some of the best Indian we've had in Pittsburgh."
5,I have gone here twice and each time excellent service and food. If you can put your diet on hold go and enjoy BJ's.
5,Thomas and his awesome machine cleaned our carpets like nobody else has been able to.  He took the time to come in and move furniture and ensure all of it was moved back.  He is professional and have great prices.  We highly recommend him.
5,"Oh Cornish Pasty Co, I wish I could eat you every day.  The more traditional pasties are great, as well as the Royale with cheese and the Chicken Tikka Masala one."
5,"Number one cake place in my heart. This place has completely spoiled me and is my measuring stick when I eat cake at other dessert shops (which rarely measure up). This place is a landmark for Las Vegas and an absolute must go even though the location has changed. I've been  coming here since I was a kid and whenever i can, I'll pop in here for a quick slice. The best one for me is the strawberry shortcake. It's simple but it's made so well; the vanilla cake is fluffy, moist and light and the cream is freshly whipped. The strawberries add the nice sweet acidic component wih a bit of crunch. The fruit tart is my second favorite, with fresh fruit on top of a Bavarian cream overlying a buttery crust. All the other cakes are delicious as well and you can't go wrong. \n\nOne thing I do miss is the rum cake, I hope they bring it back someday!"
5,This place is amazing!!! Eaten there many times and I feel the food gets better everytime!! The fish and shrimp are to dye for!! So delicious!! Service is super quick and the people are very friendly!! Definitely make you feel like home with the best comfort food. Will continue to go there when I am in town!!!
5,perfect staff! they are fast and do not make you wait and are not RUDE like the other! \n\nIve been to other pita's and they all think they are the only ones but this one is such a chill mesa location and close to tempe. \n\nif you looking for good food and a chilll/clean night go!
5,"I needed a safe, reliable ride from the airport because I had a tight time frame. Saw the great reviews on yelp and I am totally satisfied with the service. On time, professional, got me to my event on time. Highly recommend!"
5,"This place is such a find! Have been here many times and literally everything is amazing!!! The pad Thai is the best I've ever had and the beef pho with garlic is killer. Also love to order the panang chicken for lunch, super tasty! Make sure you don't order it too spicy because they don't mess around when it comes to spice. I love spicy food but find myself at about a level 3 for spice when I'm here. Definitely a gem!! It's kinda of out of the way for us but soooo worth the drive!!!"
5,Joel Franco has such creative integrity.  I find collaboration with him to be a pleasure. He is a real rainmaker and visionary.   He defuses stress and anxiety and fosters a really sense of unity and safe space to experiment and take creative risks.   I specifically look forward to working on his projects.  He is going places and I feel fortunate to be part of his team. I could not think higher of Joel Franco.
5,"Legendary smoke meat and at a affordable price, and amazing service, you haven't come to Montreal until you have tried schwartz's"
5,"Oh, this place was true luxury.  With a creative drink menu and attentive cocktail servers, you really cannot ask for more when it comes to a relaxing night in Vegas.  You sit below a heater (on chilly desert nights) in comfortable plush couches and chairs, you have a table that feels miles away from everyone else, and on top of all of this you get to watch some free shows as entertainment from atop the glorious waterfall spurts forth every 30 minutes!"
5,"Been going here for over 6 years now. Owners and staff are honest & genuine. Doesn't matter if you are spending $100 or $10K, you will get the same level of service every time. They also pay top dollar for gold."
5,When this hotel was revella it was phenomenal! My bf and I reserved a suit for a great price and had a great time
5,"After so many years, this is still the best Vegas buffet!  It's ~$35 per person for weekend dinner, but I think it's definitely worth it.  They have both Snow Crab AND Alaskan King Crab legs that are already pre-cracked for.  Their selection of red meat is also much better than the other buffets, including Kalbi-marinated Ostrich, Prime Rib, Quail, Pork Loin and more.  And don't forget to leave room for a plate or two of desserts.  All the mini-sized desserts are delicious and just the right portion for when your stomach is starting to run low on space.  Be sure to get there around 5:30-6pm as the line does start to build up later on."
5,One of the best costumer services I have ever encounter. Working in the costumer service field for many years I completely understand hospitality and people skills. These guys on the other hand just had it completely natural. Treating every guest as if they are family. Being honest with you and very straight forward. These guys know just how to run a business. I went in not knowing to much about what kind of fish I could have in a reef tank and they taught me so much over the course of about an hour. I was able to ask as many questions as I wanted with out feeling as though I was bothering. Not to mention if they didn't have a fish I was looking for or coral they were willing to go the extra mile to get it on for me. The prices were great I couldn't ask for a better deal all there fish were extremely heathy. I have no complaints if I could offer these guys more stars I would. I will be returning for more purchases!
5,"I drive ALL THE WAY from Maricopa to eat here, the food is that good!!!!! Our Chinese restaurants in Maricopa are AWFUL, please open one there!!!!! This place isn't very appealing to the eye, and can easily be overlooked lol but thats why I like it...the hole in the walls are always the best!!!! The food is always fresh, and made to perfection. Very good Chinese food is sooooo hard to find in Arizona!!"
5,"Dr. LePore is AMAZING! He is always willing to help us with our twins and he is so good with them. They enjoy going to the doctor and find him very amusing. Ny son is shy around people he doesn't see very often, but this is not the case with Dr. LePore and his office staff. He even helps me with prescriptions since I am between doctors myself. He is the best!"
5,Gorgeous room and fantastic service! The bed is the comfiest I have ever slept in! I love their shampoo: Shanghai Tang. Smells sooo good! It was a nice quiet retreat from the craziness on the strip. Definitely will stay there again!
5,We love Hubbard!! Our 7 year old son has been going here since he was 2 years old. Our 5 and 2 1/2 year old kids since they were 6 months old. We have had great instructors through the years. They have always been welcoming and friendly. Their prices and policy is very competitive and one of the best. They have accommodated our son with Autism specially well. Our family is truly grateful for the support and attention they have given our son and family. Thank you Hubbard for teaching our kids all about water and swim!
5,"Food was delicious and the service impeccable.  I had the mushroom bisque, scallops and panna cotta for dessert. Need I write three more paragraphs? I think not."
5,"We stayed four nights in a two bedroom suite. The rooms of the suite were stunning. The master bedroom was large enough to get lost in, even with a king size bed. The suite has two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a small living room and a kitchenette. There are three TVs in the suite. The alarm clock radios in the bedrooms have an external plug to connect your iPod. The room has Wi-Fi, four bars on my Mac PowerBook. Amenities include a smallish pool, better than continental breakfast and dinner (complimentary), a fitness room and a business center. All in all, it's not a resort but it's a damn nice place to stay.\n\nWe were there in July. Phoenix as really fricking hot in July. No one goes to Phoenix Arizona in July. Because of that, we got this stunning suite for only $120 a night. Go with all the other Lemmings in January and you pay $290 a night."
5,"If you're only going to visit one antiquarian bookshop in Edinburgh, I'd recommend Old Town Bookshop. \n\nAside from being on one of the loveliest streets in Edinburgh, it's a delightful wee shop that stocks an eye-watering selection of books from the 1850s onwards. There's a treasure chest of Scottish history, architecture and topographical studies alongside special editions of literary classics from Shakespeare, Dickens and Burns. \n\nAs the shop is run by a painter, they also sell some lovely prints, lithographs, etchings, paintings and maps of Edinburgh and beyond.  Tourists hoping to pick up a picture of the Castle should note these are priced \u00a330 - \u00a3300 depending on the age, quality and scarcity of the work."
5,"The owner was there and greeted us very warmly. I was able to order quickly and sit down, she came to our table and invited my daughter to play with her daughter when she was finished eating. Our food came quickly. It was fresh and delicious. I mentioned wanting more jalapenos and instead she provided me with chopped home-grown Thai chilis, incredible!! Most places suck at providing the kind of heat I desire. I would definately go back!"
5,"I purchased a Groupon since this place isn't far from my house. I brought my husband and my 2 year old in for a nice meal. It was a great experience because they catered to my 2 year old with kiddie cups, crayons and coloring books. Not to mention the staff was very sweet to my little boy which is typically unexpected in a sports bar/grill atmosphere. My husband had the prime rib wrap which he thought was amazing! I had the Spaghetti Amatriciana of which I have nothing bad to say about it. It was more food than I could eat! The best part was that they had a kid's menu. He had chicken strips and fries and ate all of it! Needless to say we will be back for sure."
5,"Do you ever find yourself making your own arrangements to go skiing or snowboarding and get a bit overwhelmed when dealing with transportation, hotels, and lift tickets?  Well, I have found that with the Phoenix-based Alpine Ski Club that you can get all of this packaged together at a great price along with rental discounts, a trip captain to serve a great resource, and many new friends!  In fact, the mission on their website is \""to provide fun, affordable adventure trips for families, couples, singles or anyone looking for a hassle-free vacation.\""\n\nThe Alpine Ski Club staff have been running these trips for years, and you can clearly tell.  Between my friends, co-workers, and me, we have enjoyed a few trips each season.  There are the turn-around trips to Sunrise or trips that are several days long to Telluride and Durango (and many other popular locations).  Sometimes, the trips even have themes.  So, should you be thinking of a ski trip whether you're going on your own or with others, check out this business since they may be able to package together everything and beat whatever price you otherwise found."
5,"The perfect afternoon at Tonto is 2 prickly pear margaritas, the Three Sisters Salsa with a side of guac, and dessert. Their desserts are often-changing (sometimes, just made for that day) and awesome! We are usually the youngest people in the place. But, we are usually there on Friday afternoons or weeknights.\n\nWhen there for dinner, I get a burger and sweet potato tots. The margaritas are good...not weak like some of the local places. I am pretty happy after two. \n\nIf you go on your birthday, tell them. You get this little box with a couple of handmade chocolates. TO DIE FOR! Also, follow them on facebook. They post pics of new dishes and dessserts a few times a week. Sometimes we change our plans based on these pics!"
5,"Bring from Okinawa, we had our 15 year high school reunion in Vegas and had to spend the last night at an izakaya opened by an Okinawan! I was the DD so I didn't drink much but as a group, we ate and drank the lights out and the bill came out to around $20 / person! Insane! We stayed way past their business hour and they were very kind and offered a large bottle of Orion for us. Love it!"
5,"Yummy!!  We ate family style, ordering several kinds of meats, cheeses, olives, sausage and pepper pizza, and house made gelattos.  It was all really great.  The wine list is terrific, staff was super informed and helpful. The front patio is fun to people watch and to see the street performers, and listen to the singers. We really enjoyed it and will definitely come back."
5,"It's true, you get what you pay for. Here you pay a lot (unless you are comped) and you get a lot. I think every room is a suite, 3 TVs, mini bar, comfortable space, clean, very friendly staff. \n\nIf I have any criticism it would be the pool- (I now know they have 3) but the one I went to did not receive sun."
5,"Best Movie Theater in Las Vegas hands down. The snacks and treats are normal priced for a theater. The popcorn is actually remarkably good with the flavored butter topping they use. the theaters themselves are massive to accommodate the chairs. Therein lies the trump card, the chairs are massive and comfortable recliners. They recline almost completely and are electronic. The most comfortable I have ever seen a in a public place. The price for a ticket is a little steep so save it for a movie you're gonna love."
5,I am so happy a delicious and family owned ice cream shop came to my neighborhood! The ice cream is a amazing and a cronut?!!! BONUS!
5,"Great show, loved it, interactive great cast and more affordable than a lot of the shows on the strip.you will not regret it!"
5,"Brand spanking new CFA in the Arcadia area!! Location is a little cramped, but they've handled the traffic flow..making the only entrance off 44th street. \n\nTypical CFA food - tasty chicken and poly sauce\nAlways exceptional customer service. :)"
5,"Around 150 beers... team trivia... no nonsense. A cruisers paradise and and eclectic mix of people. Beer snobs and frat kids alike! You always find something you like with the super knowledgable bartenders/staff, and you will never feel out of place. I love love love this bar. There are different happy hours every night and Team Trivia on Tuesdays\n\nOh, ps. This is NOT a sports bar... there are handful of older televisions through the place so go to BWW if you're looking for a game."
5,"My favorite course in the valley.  Not fancy, not expensive, the golf is awesome, great views, great staff, great men's club.  My only concern going forward is ASU taking over... Tee times are going to be hard to come by, and that is too bad.  I really wish ASU would keep Karsten around and leave this course to Phoenix..."
5,Another awesome visit without friends at Taxco. Chicken Quesadilla with a side of rice. Shredded chicken with a scoop of white cheese sauce.
5,"A friend recently read about BlueMoon in the paper and while we were driving by, we decided to \""check it out\"".    We were both very pleased with the choice!    First impressions - clean, small, open and friendly.   \n\nI really like spring rolls, so I didn't want to miss out on a wonderful opportunity.   I decided to splurge and get 2 orders of spring rolls and share with my friend.    I got the Shrimp and Pork (tom vat hit - #3A) and BBQ Pork (Thit Nuong - #3D).   Admittedly, after my first one, I didn't want to share!   They were excellent, fresh, and filling.   The Chili-lime fish sauce added an extra zing that made the experience even more rewarding.   \n\nFor the main course, accompanying the delectable delight of the appetizers (a meal in and of themselves), I decided on the Noodle Soup (Pho).   I went with the Rare steak, flank, brisket, tendon, and tripe rice noodle soup (Pho Tai, Nam, Chin Gan, Sach - #61).     It was delicious and very satisfying.   \n\nThere are so MANY other dishes on the menu!    I plan on going back as frequently as possible so that I can try them all.  On top of the great food, the service was excellent, and price was modest... you can't go wrong here!\n\nBrian S\n\n\nBlueMoon Vietnamese Kitchen\n1933 W. Main St. Ste, #8\nMesa, Arizona 85201\nPhone: 480 733-7771\nhttp://www.bluemoonaz.com/"
5,OMG! The yellow chicken curry is fantastic. I moved here from Los Angeles in February and have searched around for the right place to buy awesome Thai food and I am so glad I found it on the first shot. The food here reminds me of the great tastes you can find in California.
5,"I was more than pleasantly surprised by my afternoon lunch here.  I was impressed.  The waiters were terrific: personable yet straightforward, and quick!\n\nThe food, although a bit expensive, in my opinion, was excellent.  In fact, my Grilled Shrimp Salad was one of the best I have ever tasted!  It was outdone by the dessert, however.  We were encouraged by the Server to try the Coconut Cake, as it was his favorite.  I don't even especially like coconut but it was fantastic!  The cake was dense, the frosting was buttery, and creamy, and not-too-sweet.  The meal was absolutely perfection!\n\nI would definitely recommend this, with some time at the museum, for a perfect afternoon!"
5,"We recently hired Patrick of Eco-Clean Carpet Cleaning to clean our carpeting and his work was exceptional.  Patrick placed protective corner guards throughout our apartment and took care to not damage anything!   Our carpeting was heavenly stained and matted, however when he was finished our carpeting looked terrific!  Plus our carpeting did not take long to dry and our allergies were not aggravated by the green cleaning products.  We're very pleased to have a professional Green Carpet Cleaning Service that we can recommend to our family, friends and clients."
5,This my new favorite pizza place! The lunch special is great and the food is delicious! The service is great too.
5,"In a city (especially the Strip) loaded with overpriced, overcooked and unremarkable food - the Burger Bar is a fabulous find.\n\nMy husband had the veggie burger with guacamole (and we're guac snobs) and it was delicious.  My salmon burger was perfectly cooked and complimented by their veal-shallot reduction sauce.  You basically build your own burger.  There's alot to choose from, so you may as well utilize the helpful staff so you can have a good experience.  (Asking restaurant staff's opinion is an underrated activity.  It also explains the grumpy reviews on this page.)\n\nWith good staff (who rave about the owner/chef, Hubert Keller) and options plentiful, if you don't find something you like at a price that works for you - it's your own fault.\n\nEat here now!"
5,Excellent service. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. They worked had to make us feel relaxed. My husband enjoyed our massage so much we came back the next day for another 90 min... he's spoiled.
5,I love this place!  I feel blessed to live so close to it and be able to work out before work.   Great trainers!  Diet plan rocks.  Very happy w/ my results.
5,"Absolutely delicious! Catfish, boudin balls, shrimp \u00e9touff\u00e9e, all scrumptious. Have never eaten Cajun before, I am amazed... Will be back!!!!"
5,"When you have people come up to you during your wedding saying things like \""The food at your wedding is so good... it's better than my wedding\"" you know you have an amazing caterer. \n\nLena's Flowers and Catering did an absolutely fantastic job at our wedding! Working with the vendor was an absolute breeze. We were able to do a great tasting which helped us narrow down our selection ( sooooo many options!) and were extremely impressed with the chef and the professionalism. We opted to do a buffet to give everyone a taste of everything and we are so glad we did! People raved about the Prime Rib and Pork Tenderloin and they couldn't get enough of the sun dried tomato/garlic mashed potatoes! Everything was really delicious and prepared perfectly. \nFlowers were also fantastic! I utilized this vendor for my bouquet, my MoH's bouquet, and boutonnieres and corsages. I was so appreciative of the time they took during the consultation and also the fact that they didn't try to shove traditional bouquets down my throat. They really listened to my ideas and offered some amazing flower suggestions. When the bouquets arrived, I couldn't believe how pretty and unique they were! \nTotally a pleasure working with this vendor and would do it again in a heartbeat!"
5,"Visited for the first time this week.  Smallish place but welcomign and comfortable.  Has dart area and several TVs, high and low tables as well as bar seating.  It's a little hard to find in the center but it's therere on the SWC of McDowell and Scottsdale Rd\n\nReally enjoyed the beer selection - about 20 bears on tap and dozens in bottles.  They really have a great selection.  \n\nWe tried the hot pretzels, smoked jalapeno salsa, thai chicken and muffleta pizzas... All we very good.\n\nThe place was packed on a Thursday evening but we had great service."
5,"Fantastic! Had the Pig, Pork, Cow burger. It was so tasty. Ivan was wonderful. He makes a great Bloody Mary!"
5,"I had Michele V as my stylist and could not have been happier!  One of the best haircuts I have ever had.  My hair went from looking sad and lifeless to short and looks like I have volume.  And, she was fast.  Highly recommend."
5,"An ancient compressor (Chrysler 1973) on my older A/C unit failed.  Mark came out in the evening and went straight to work diagnosing the failed part just to be sure it was dead.  He tested everything and indeed it was dead.  Every other contractor just looked at it and supposed it was dead.  Mark actually tested the power, grounds, caps etc.\n\nHe gave me a very competitive written proposal for repairs.  In the end I used another provider due to a very long relationship with that person (but at a higher price).  \n\nI would use and recommend Mark again at any time."
5,"How does this NOT have a solid 5 stars?  Maybe because I have a certain love for little hole in the wall bars and awesome beer that others do not.\n\nCame here for a second date, and it was a great night.  We didn't eat, although everything looked really yummy.  The beer selection couldn't be beat, and the prices were just right.  Awesome juke box and many televisions to watch whatever sporting event that might happen to be on.  The atmosphere is great and the staff are very attentive without being overbearing.  \n\nI will definitely be frequenting this wonderful place!"
5,"BEST SALAD I'VE EVER TASTED, I'm addicted and drive across town just to get their Shrimp Caesar Salad.  This is one of the best flavor combinations ever to grace my palate so I don't mind paying the money for it (something about that cilantro dressing, the slightly spicy shrimp and those crispy noodles).  This is all I ever order (frequently take out which is easy), but I love that my daughter can have their kid's pizza for an affordable price and she just adores getting the raw ball of dough to play with while waiting.  The decor is kinda kitchy but I don't notice too much because my nose is buried in the SALAD!  They always ask me if I want my iced tea packed up for the road, it's the little things....  Love it love it love it!"
5,We have been using JNS Final Touch for a year now and each and every time are pleased. \n\nThe service is always consistent and we have never had an issue and will continue to use them for this reason. \n\nThe owner is communicative and honest and we have come to count on them and their professionalism when trusting them in our home.\n\nHighly recommend this company.
5,"This place was awesome, we will for sure return! I found this gem on Yelp, always looking to try new sushi restaurants. My husband and I came here for dinner, we walked in and I became a little leery because we were the only ones in the place. We ordered yellow tail nigiri, gyoza, a shrimp tempura roll, salmon & tuna roll in rice paper, and a california roll with fresh tuna on top (I don't remember the actual names of the rolls). \n\nThe meal started out with a complimentary cucumber salad, which was very good. Then we were brought out our order of gyoza which was a very generous portion with 8 dumplings (usually you get 6). After that we received our nigiri, which was nice and fresh tasting, and then the rest of our rolls that we had ordered. The chef had some extra yellow tail, so he made us a complimentary salad with it that included avocado and rice wine vinegar, it was fantastic! The fish was very fresh and flavorful, and the portions were very generous. We ordered too much and were stuffed by the end of the meal. We were however, able to fit in the complimentary mochi ice cream we were given. The service here was amazing, and we felt very welcomed. I would highly recommend Harumi Sushi!"
5,"There is nothing like a fresh from the oven pizza with melted cheese and my favorite toppings! The quality and freshness is consistent and I love the dessert pizzas, too! MC"
5,Had an awesome time on the patio!  Great service...Garrick knows his beer and how to pair it!  Awesome food!  Awesome atmosphere!  AND awesome beers!  Definately my new spot for casual fun!
5,"Most exceptional place in one of the loveliest and upbeat areas of Montreal. Non-chalant and chic atmosphere even late at night on a Thursday (the day we had late dinner), most courteous personnel, epicurean-savvy.\nThe menu and wine list were easy to navigate, yet hard to get through - so many competing& compelling options :) We ended up with planche de charcuteries maison, pave de saumon sauvage, bonbons de foie gras de canard & cassolette de champignons de saison, along with a Pinot Noir from Closson Chase, Prince Edward county.\nA culture gem, most definitely ;)\n--------\n--------\nJust noticed that Alexandre Gosselin, Chez Victoire's chef, is competing in Gold Medal Plates 2011\n\nhttp://goldmedalplates.com/c_montreal.html\n\nGOOD LUCK! :))"
5,"We had a great time here picking out furniture for our twin boys Marshall and Mathew.  the sales staff was great and knew the product very well.  We always try to support the small business owner, and i would advise other people to use this shop because of the great individual service."
5,"Four Peaks is one of those places I rarely go to (and it really isn't all that far from where I currently live & and where I was living right after I moved back to AZ after college), and I always wonder why. I mean, everyone knows how awesome their brews are (I love that Kiltlifter has become pretty much a staple that's on tap at a good deal of AZ bars), but I think the food here is delicious as well and tends to get overlooked.  \n\nThe last time I came here I just nibbled on some apps, and they were all delicious. The spinach artichoke is honestly one of the best I've ever had (and spinach artichoke dip is one of my favorite apps/meals so I've sampled quite a bit). It's chunky , yet creamy, and just all around awesome. I'm also a big baked pretzel fan & the one at Four Peaks is delicious. \n\nWhen it comes to beer I generally stick to the staples (Kiltlifter & 8th St. Ale), both of which I really like (Kiltlifter is one of, if not my favorite beer). Of course when it's time to roll out the Pumpkin Porter I'm all about that as well!\n\nI also really like the atmosphere here. When the weather is nice the patio is comfortable, and there's plenty of TV's & good seating to catch football inside."
5,Quite possibly the best taco I have ever had in my life. Cannot wait to get back to Vegas to have another!!!
5,"fantastic! loved everything about it...especially the fact that the guy taking tickets upgraded our seats from the upper mezzanine to orchestra.  highly recommend seeing this show, it was the highlight of our trip."
5,This is the best Cajun place in Arizona. The portions are great and the people behind the counter are really nice. I love gumbo and I have tried several kinds here and all of them were excellent. Yes the decor isn't 5 stars but seriously if you're more worried about mood lighting and soft cushions you can go to Pappadeaux's and get charged an arm and a leg for lower quality food. the drive and the price are definitely worth it for this place.
5,"I think it's mainly the staff. 3 times there and 3 times we were treated really well. Fun, friendly, and good at their job. The food, really good. Last night we had a huge, garlicky Caesar. The fish was cobia which is a firmer fish (not steaky) on this incredible coconut milk rice pile. It was a tasty dish. I had the tuna app. Not great, but not bad. Will try something else next time. Gladly has a huge single malt scotch list. If you're into it, it's cool how they bring out this machine that makes the big pure ice ball. Nice atmosphere and nothing felt really overpriced. The bill $110, with 4 scotches. Seems reasonable for a nice Saturday night out."
5,"My wife and I ate here only because of a Groupon. We loved EVERYTHING about this hole in the wall. The staff is beyond friendly, the calamari appetizer was amazing, the pizza could not have been better, and they had a great selection of beer and wine.\nOur server, Modest, made us feel welcomed and special. She was extremely easy to chat with and engaged us in a greatly enjoyable conversation.  Before we even finished our meal my wife and I made the decision that this place was going to be part of our Dinning Out rotation. We greatly look forward to going back as soon as possible."
5,"Excellent meal,  great entertainment and the chef was a lot of fun.   The sake is very good too.   This place is easy better now that it's not hooters any more   we'll be back to this one."
5,"I don't understand the bad reviews. I've taken 3 cars there a total of maybe 9 times and have always had great service, great price and no problems.  And I know that if there is a problem they'll take care of it.  My service rep is Penny and she's great."
5,"Any time I want sushi, Yama is the place to go.  The rolls are excellent, the all you can eat is definitely worth the price with tonkatsu, hamachi kama, and other awesome dishes as appetizers included in all you can eat, plus whatever rolls they offer.  They also have ice cream and mochi to help end the meal proper.  So good!"
5,"This just in, Central Phoenix is getting a Green Restaurant where the old That's a Wrap location is.  Finally a great vegetarian restaurant in Phoenix.\n\nI had the delicious Green Burger at the Scottsdale location.  I don't know what they put in that burger but it satisfied my carnivore side.  There were many options for my side dish.  I had fresh fruit.  I have gone vegetarian two times.  Each time lasted about a year.  I just like the feeling of eating good food and not ending up a bloated beached whale.  Even after I shared a Chocolate Monsoon Soynami for dessert I could still walk out the door feeling good about what I put into my body.  The Soynamies rock by the way.  If a DQ Blizzard and a Soynami got in a taste test fight the Soynami would kick ass and take no prisoners.\n\nCheck out Green, even if you eat meat.  The food is excellent and good for you.  Go eat."
5,"Favorite Sunday brunch place in Pittsburgh for Vegans and Vegetarians. Love the vegan buffet and I could eat just that, but then you also get a great entree to choose from too. Try the green beans, sesame noodles, and the vegan deserts. \n\n The only drawback is that sometimes the entree portions are too big. Don't take people take people who don't appreciate a diversion from the norm. \n\nI really feel like I can get my fill for $10."
5,"The long line Sunday morning is truly an indicator of how near and dear LUX coffeebar is to some residents of Phoenix, myself included.  As a people, us Urbanites are not generally prone to, well, waiting-- but these guys tamp out a mean cup that's just THAT good.  \n\nI live in Tempe and work in CenPho (@ Practical Art & Sack's Cafe), so I'm usually blipping in and out before work at the end of my commute, but I covet those few hours a week I can sneak away from everything, nestle up in a chic designer chair, and click away on my laptop (which--- outlets galore!-- I can actually plug in!).  On occaision, finding space to perch my bum can be a bit dodgy, and when it's chilly out their ample outdoor seating just isn't all that enticing-- but the times when I've been completely stymied have been few and far between.  \n\nI'm sort of a plain Jane and generally just order a non-fat latte (don't ruin their great, roasted on-site coffee with a syrup!) from their friendly, knowledgeable staff. And I have to say, I love the tattoos, piercings, and mod-indie clothes sported by some of the staff-- makes me feel right at home! \n\nLast rave-- they support local artists & sustainable practices. I heart them."
5,Had a wonderful dinner here. Sat outside on the patio which opens up onto a quiet courtyard - very romantic. \n\nWe decided to order only one entree and several starters and sides which turned out to be a nice way to try more items on the menu. Our favorites were the braised leeks and rutabaga with creme fraiche. Also ordered dessert which was incredible. Don't miss out on trying whatever they have to offer - the lemon cake we had was top notch.
5,After visiting several vapor shops I found the E-juice i have been looking for.  There selections are all made to order and they will make custom orders if they have the flavor to make it.  The atmosphere is a cross between a very casual local bar with very friendly people and your friends house.
5,"The wife and I were looking for a new spot to eat for lunch. We have heard about the upcoming Mochiko Chicken concept opening soon so we went on the second day they opened. We were not disappointed, as the service has a very personal touch. The chicken tenders are the best you can buy- nothing like it anywhere else! (we tried raising kanes and they are dry and flavorless). Lychee lemonade is very tasty (although I felt that it could use lemon). The chicken is so good, however, I felt that there should be a bone-in option as well. In the end, I note a few things. The place is small, but gives you the feeling that they will go above and beyond for a guest. Friendly staff and owner is clearly a big part of daily operation. I was lucky enough to be waited on by the owner (Jerry) and he was anxious and more than helpful with all of our questions. I strongly recommend trying Mochiko, you will not be disappointed- Oh and pro-tip: ask for a sunny up egg on your rice bowl/ ENJOY!"
5,"I had Aaron tattoo a hummingbird on my ankle.  It looks fantastic!!!  Aaron, Sarah, and Heather were all very pleasant and professional.  I would highly recommend\nChic Ink Boutique to anyone who wants a great quality tattoo."
5,"I was surprised to see a plumber earning a full 5 stars, but after calling Gabe I now understand.  He came out and inspected a possible leak going from my upstairs to downstairs bathroom.  The leak is only mild and happens only occasionally.  He told me simply to caulk up some leaks in my shower upstairs and the problem should be fixed.  When I halfheartedly offered him some money, he refused to accept it, and simply gave me his card asking to call him in case i have any future problems."
5,A SHOW TO SEE WHILE YOUR IN VEGAS!!! the show was simply mind blowing....im not going to give any secrets away in this review....you just have to go see it =))
5,"30 July 2013\n\nGreat customer service by the CSR (terminal 4 North) on the graveyard/swing shift! Courteous, kept us updated, and offered refreshing ice cold water! A necessity during 100 degree. Thanks v much! Xx\n\nPrice for RT service was less expensive than a taxi one-way."
5,Driving from Utah to Los Angeles and needed a place to eat. The yelp reviews were right on!!! The food was excellent and guys were very friendly. Definitely hitting this place up the next time in Vegas.
5,This fro-yo is AWESOME!!! The pineapple flavor was AMAZING & the customer service was WONDERFUL!!! I HIGHLY recommend this place!
5,I went in for an exam and birth control today. I saw Dr Pritchard and she was such a sweetheart and really knew what she was talking about! \nThe receptionists were very nice and helpful as well and I was very impressed with the overall visit. I will be definitely going back there again!
5,"This place is awesome! From the iced tea to the desserts, this hit all cylinders. Service was great and they knew the menu. The chicken pesto lasagna was beyond amazing! My family and I will be back."
5,"A VERY good pizza!\n\nI have tried the mushroom & pepperoni toppings, both on special crusts. Both were incredible and I cannot wait to crack open the onion-topped pizza too. \n\nAs a first-timer, the employee made me feel welcome and explained the pizzas. He gave candid recommendations that I believe were spot on. \n\nThanks!"
5,"VERY surprised by this gem in the Trop. I love the Trop, truly, but it's essence as an old person casino didn't leave me expecting a 1397-star dinner. But, holy cannoli! From the moment we arrived at the host station to the end of our meal, we were blown away. Our table had:\nCocktails at the bar prior to the meal \nLuna pinot grigio\nPan seared scallops\nWatermelon amuse boush \nLobster tail\nPorterhouse\nDry aged rib eye\nSurf and Turf\nMash of the moment (suped-up bacon mashed potatoes)\nHarissa corn\nLemon asparagus \nSeasonal veggies (squash)\nDeconstructed banana cream pie\nTrio of brules\nGelato\n\nNot one of the four of us (yeahhh, 4 people ate ALL of that) could find fault with anything during our dinner. We were all incredibly satisfied!"
5,"We stopped here while we were waiting for our room on our first day in Vegas. We didn't realize it was Sunday Brunch until we sat down and noticed the servers in PJ's! It was a little expensive, but we looked at the menu and decided to  stay. \n\nWe tried  quite a few things, including: Mexican Bruschetta, a couple of different Crostini, Ribs, Philly Benedict, Crepes and a Grilled Veggie Omelette. I also tried almost everything from the Sushi Station (I love their Sushi!), a Mixed Berry Smoothie, Mimosa and even a mini Chocolate Mousse.\n\nService was prompt, casual and friendly. Brunch at Simon was a Great way to ease into our Vegas Vacation."
5,"Holy Stromboli!\n\nEnough said.  Stromboli is awesome.\n\nMy wife brought home the Meatball Stromboli.  I didn't get to try it until the next day, reheated, and it was still great if not better than fresh.  I always thought I didn't really like Stromboli until I tried the one at Biaggio's Pizzeria.  Now I'm a believer."
5,"Unique, quirky atmosphere. Laid-back vibes. Good place to relax.\n\nYes, the Bad-Breath-Burger is amazing. As is the West of the Andes sandwich (with tuna thanks very much). If you like seared tuna as much as I do, this is a good option.\n\nGinger beer is highly-recommended. How many places can you even order that? \n\nThe service was quick and sincere.\n\nIf I lived in the neighborhood, this would be one of my go-to places."
5,I absolutely LOVE Dr Moss. She is very knowledgable and makes you feel comfortable. She helped me through my first pregnancy in 2011. Her staff was very understanding and helpful even though I would be calling everyday for questions. I only wish she was still an OB so I can go through my 2nd pregnancy with her.
5,"What a brilliant place to have breakfast. The coffee was delicious, and the staff was entertaining and very friendly.\n\nAnd they have crepes! Spectacular ones!\n\nIf you're in or around Old Town you should absolutely stop by. Grab a sandwich or crepe to go, or take a seat in their cute little dining area. Plus, the staff openly speak French and at least one of them may break out into song. Highly recommended."
5,"This place never has a long wait, always has delicious food, and their snicker doodle coffee roast is very delicious, a must try!\nThe staff and even the manager is always super friendly, upbeat and always helpful."
5,"My favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. I have never ordered something that I didn't like. I take my out of town guests here and they all love it too. Highly recommend. I never thought that a french restaurant would be my favorite, but definitely give it a chance."
5,"This place transformed our life!  We are vegetarian, but wanted to give the raw thing a try.  I was very impressed with the creative, delicious meals and desserts!  My kids were even impressed (ages 6 and 8).  The dishes are a little pricey, but I am willing to pay because I know that a lot of effort, time and quality ingredients go into making this type of food.  I love the food, the atmosphere and the nice people that work there.  I will always try to work in a visit here when I come to Phoenix!"
5,"FEZ has a very modern and sophisticated feel, perfect for the millennial generation. I tried the FEZ burger and it was outstanding! The flavor profile for inner BBQ sauce lovers is worth the trip alone. Not to mention the fantastic drinks (get the Feztini). I will be returning to FEZ during my next pit stop to PHX!"
5,"Just relocated and our cars were in dire need of a bath. A realtor suggested this place to us. I was really confused at first. A car wash and good BBQ? I wasn't sure what to expect, so we went. And it was great! \n\nOur cars were thoroughly washed and my husband's was hand waxed. Both came out looking fantastic! While we waited, we had some BBQ for lunch. Having lived in the South, was this the best BBQ ever? No. But my plate was clean and I was pretty surprised at how good it was! \n\nInside you will also find a bakery, great wine selection, beer, and an extensive gift shop ranging from kitchen decor to kids books. There was literally a little bit of everything!\n\nI might not always go for lunch, but this is our new car wash spot. For anyone from the Midwest or Denver, think Waterway on steroids."
5,"I love the poker palace, last couple times we were in Vegas we drove up here for some 21. The dealers are super friendly and the drinks are cheap, this place is in no way scary! Will be moving to Las Vegas soon and plan on coming here regularly."
5,"Great price for a great massage.  Don't let the price of the massage fool you - these are professionals who provide a great service.  They are partnered with a nail salon, but their actual rooms are in the back of the business away from any fumes and noise.  Cute tiki hut decor adds to the experience.  I would highly recommend!"
5,"This place is amazing!  The girls found that Wednesdays are just plain wonderful, with their food and wine deals... Delicious pizza and the half price bottles of wine can't be beat... Can't wait to go back. \nThe owners are friendly, welcoming and inviting."
5,"I really like this place. We came here for a quicker dinner last night and for the breakfast buffet in the morning. It's conveniently located a few steps from the elevators and is decently priced.\nThey have real soft and tasty bread they bring out while you're ordering. I consumed a pulled pork sandwich on whole wheat bread which was THE BOMB. Dad got the rachel (pastrami) which he said was \""very good and tender\"". \n\nThe breakfast buffet rocks. its like $16 a person and they have an omelette station, sausages, bacon, ham, scrambled eggs, assortment of breakfast muffins/pastries, few different cereals (the house made granola and nuts is great), and some oatmeal. Simple, tasty, good, drinks included, very little wait time even on this busy summer weekend."
5,Very nice tea room with cozy atmosphere.  It is where you wear a hat and gloves are optional.  Very girly and fun.  The gift shop next door has so many unusual and unique items.
5,My go to spot in Chinatown after Van Roy's had closed down several years ago. Food is always great. Always a special place in my heart for New Dynasty!
5,"My FAVORITE teriyaki place in Vegas. The best teriyaki sauce and the meat is cooked just right. Plus, you get a lot for the price you pay."
5,"I've only seen it once, but as a previous poster states, there's so much going on that you'd have an entirely different experience if you went to see it again.  I've seen 'O' and 'Mystere' twice and both were markedly different.  \n\nI did not know until just not that this show is NOT a part of Cirque.  Not sure why, but I just always assumed it was.  Nevertheless, if you are a fan of Cirque, you're going to love Le R\u00eave."
5,I have seen Dr John A Ebner on several occasions and I have been impressed by his knowledge and chairside manner. Dr Ebner always takes time to explain what it is he plans on doing and continues to explain as he does the procedures. There are never any surprises except for a follow up phone call I received from Dr. Ebner after a surgery. He stated he was just checking in to see how I was doing and reminded me of the post op procedures help with my recovery. I have recommended Dr Ebner to many of my freinds as I believe he's a doc who cares about his patients.
5,"This body shop is the best! Hadi Ghrairi goes above and beyond to make his customers happy! I am new to Charlotte and was in a fender bender. I had no idea where to go but luckily found Custom Paint and Body! He came in on a Saturday when not many other body shops are open to give me an estimate. The following Tuesday the job was complete! I looked around and got a few different estimates, his was the best out of all of them and he was able to complete the job in one day compared to others that needed two full days to fix my car! In addition he offered to give me a ride back to my car that was not being worked on so I didn't have to wait, take a bus, or be stranded. This body shop earns all five stars with ease! Hopefully I am not in any more wrecks for a while but if I am I know where i will go to get my car repaired!"
5,Fantastic beer selection & the food was great. With 31 beers on tap this place is for serious beer lovers. They even have 5 wines on tap. The food was great; the wings had 3 different sauces for dipping. The service was prompt & friendly. I will definitely go back!
5,"Exactly what I expected! Sandwiches were perfect, creative, and fresh. Great atmosphere and service. I would eat here weekly if it was closer! Well done ZOOKZ!"
5,"Loved this place! Tried it out recently for the first time. The staff were all friendly and nice. It was pretty easy to order and had a casual ambience. \n\nThis is comparable to Panera Bread. They have more choices and some could consider their soups, salads and sandwiches as a bit more high-end (items like lobster bisque and crab sandwiches!) They include French bread and chocolate covered strawberries with each order which is a mega +."
5,"Love it. Must try while in Montreal. \n\nIf you live in Montreal, annual membership is so worth it. \n\nVery convenient, and if something goes wrong you can phone them. Very helpful. \n\nWebsite tracks your riding info etc. Very convenient.\n\nWhen you return a bike, make sure you see a green light. You might get a fine of $200 etc. \n\nBixi isn't built for a long ride. It's made for stability and frequent stops and safety etc. (Not for racing, not for endurance. It's made for tourism, convenience, and commuting)\n\nMontreal has a nice bike network. Best online map for bikes here: http://www.pedalmontreal.ca/"
5,"Being a fan of both P&T and of Bullshit!, this was my absolute must-do for a recent trip to Vegas.\n\nDon't expect a lot of stage splash - the music, lights, fog, etc. These two really don't do it.\n\nWhat they do however, is both more entertaining and more clever - they very nearly explain many of the tricks, leaving you a little room to wonder. I was enchanted from the get-go.\n\nCome in expecting about 1/3 tricks, 1/3 explanation/comedy, and 1/3 political commentary, and you're gold.\n\none thing i'd recommend different then a few others, don't rush out from the show. instead wait about 20 minutes, *then* go. P&T will autograph and take pictures after the show (separately though.. would have loved one photo with them both, but alas...) if you wait a bit, the crowds will thin out, and it'll be much easier to get to them. They wait until everyone gets an autograph/photo that wants one."
5,Great Place to listen to some blues. Drinks are always great as well. Very small though. Hopefully they can expand someday soon. I'd love to see them expand.
5,"Indulged myself in some German dining this past weekend. It was a great atmosphere and the food tasted awesome. The pretzels were  unreal! Everyone was extremely kind, especially the hostess (dark hair). The wait was a little longer than I had hoped, but she made an effort to ensure we were doing well, and she kept us up to speed with why it was taking a little longer. Great service and I strongly recommend it.\n\nNick H."
5,"Thank you, Yelp! Howard is the best! He came on a Saturday morning and fixed out toilet and tub in no time flat. Professional and so nice! His rates are great and we will definitely be using Howard from now on. Great find!!"
5,"I have been here multiple times, before I started using yelp even. The bartenders are always polite and will find some way to get you talking or laughing. Its a great place to go relax after work and just sit and drink with some buddies."
5,This UPS location has some of the best customer service I have ever experience. They are extremely nice and helpful knowledgeable. They have patients and process clients quickly.
5,"I've been here since 9/21/14. My first two months have been extremely quiet, people friendly, grounds well kept and bug free. My place is partially upgraded nicely and is fair for the price. I love the location-Zipps Sports Grill, Grass Roots, Butters, Coffee joints, Chipotle, Jimmy Johns, an Indian Restaurant and TCBY. The Green Belt bike path will take you to Temp Town Lake. You rarely are on any roads with cars, so it's safe. 4.5 miles to old town which you can bike the canal. If you are having fun in Old Town, it's an $11 Uber ride. I'm sure there are noisier places in the community, but my place is great so far. Thankfully not many smokers around me either. The last two places which I reviewed were hell on earth in comparison. Oh yeah, the few minor issues I've had were handled immediately."
5,"Luckily...imagine that..I mentioned luck in a review for a location in Vegas haha....anywho...luckily this place has ALWAYS been good to me.  \nIn Vegas this past weekend a few friends and I decided to walk over to the nearest FT I knew of..which I thought was FT in Planet Hollywood (I was incorrect. Since we stayed at the Mirage the closest location was in Caesar's Forum Shops).  I grabbed a 190 Octane and Hurricane mix (add shot) in a tall mug and started sipping.  About 2 inches into my drink I was feeling FINE.  \nThe bartender was a great help, offering different mixes to my friends.  A midnight kiss=Bellini and Strawberry mix=yummo.  Oh my gosh. \nThe value is pretty great considering how hammered you can get just from tasting...and all of the containers come with lower priced refills, so KEEP THAT CUP!\nPS Just to give you an idea of the strength of these \""drinks\"", yaknow, in case you questioned it....I drank about two inches worth of mine and announced that I needed to \""Quickly slow down before I got too strunk\"" (I believe that was the word I used).  A friend of mine picked up a pair of undies (in Fredrick's) which were covered in the front and see thru lace in the back and announced that they were \""Mullet Undies, cuz they're business in the front and party in the back\""...yeah.  These are strong. \nxo"
5,"Ahh Bene's - now you deliver!!!\n\nI was informed a few days ago that my mum had bought a new flat in the city and thus I was moving to it....but it's about 20 minutes from Bene's. Seriously, this upset me a bit. I've been so used to nipping up to Bene's for a pint of milk or some dinner, I've taken it for granted. Just when I thought all hope was lost, Maria informed me that they delivery. Thank you God.\n\nNow you have no excuse not to try on of their famous dishes, they deliver!!!! woohooo!!"
5,"We were able to get day-of reservations for a Friday night at 8:30pm.  The restaurant was small, tastefully decorated and brighter than your average evening fine dining restaurant.\n\nWe got:\n-two glasses of Cabernet- great wine \n-fresh mozzarella with heirloom tomatoes.  Delicious with a little coarse salt and balsamic\n-chopped salad with a little cheese, salami and a very tasty vinaigrette.  Even though I am not much of a salad person, it was great and tasted very fresh\n-salad with balsamic dressing - wasn't as good as the chopped salad, but still quite good\n-half order of fresh pasta with Parmesan, zucchini and tomatoes -the perfect size for a lighter meal- I ate all of it.  I worried the pasta would be too heavy for a late dinner, but it was perfect in the smaller portion\n-skirt steak- this was my boyfriend's third dish with balsamic.  Perhaps by that time he had had enough balsamic, but it wasn't stellar.  The meat was cooked perfectly and the portion was generous\n-tiramisu- tasty!\n-French press coffee and cappuccino- very good as well, fresh \n\nOverall, it was an excellent meal and the smaller portions allowed us to try many different things on the menu.  Without a doubt, we will be back as the menu changes seasonally/weekly.  The menu was smaller so you could tell how the chefs spent time curating each dish and picking items in season."
5,Just had them clean the carpet in our fifth wheel. Very reasonable rates and very Conscientious. Probably the best our carpets have ever been cleaned. Will have them next time our carpets need cleaned.
5,One of the best steakhouses I've been to. Service was great. Porterhouse for two ($100 total) was amazing... Part NY steak and part filet mignon. So tender and perfect amount of salt. Good portions for two people. Mushrooms on the side and an appetizer salad made a perfect balance for two. Total bill was about $160 before tip. Would definitely go again.
5,"Sushi/ Sashimi/ Appetizer or Hot dishes, anything is good! They come with a reasonable price too.\nWill come back again! :)"
5,"Haven't had the wings yet, I will post review for that shortly, however I just place my carry out order and I must say the gentleman on the phone was great! Very polite and perfect customer service! Excited to finally try the wings!"
5,This is the real deal folks. I'm picky about my pizza after having been to Manhattan and had the pizza there many times. Mama Gina's does it right. The staff are friendly and quick and Sammy behind the bar is a real gentleman. Oh and the pizza....it's delicious! Five big stars. We'll be back!!
5,"I got so excited when Torched Goodness started coming to the Ahwatukee Farmers Market!! I would love to go to the Downtown market \n( I'm also dying to try  a Shortleash Hotdog!) but unfortunately I can't for now.\n\nI tried several samples and they were all delicious. My absolute favorite is cappucino. It's amazing! My favorite ice cream flavor is Haagen Dazs coffee and this tastes like that but a million times better. Very creamy, not overtly sweet, just perfect. The size is right as well and I love that Chef Eric devised a clever way to get your creme brulee to go.\n\nSo if you run into the Torched Goodness truck, do yourself a favor and get some creme brulee!!"
5,"I have been wanting to try this place since I heard about it on the radio...we had the lunch special, create your own pizza for $6.95...the staff was awesome and were excited to tell us the easiest way to order.  Our first pizza came out before were done with the third pizza...absolutely amazing!  We loved it!!! We mixed the pesto and white sauce...mmmmmm.  We will be back!"
5,"VERY authentic Japanese in an elegant, clean, and inviting atmosphere. The sushi is always fresh and their exotic specials (ask chef as they're hidden from the general crowd) are excellent. Don't expect Americanized super rolls here. This is the real deal folks."
5,"It's a hamburger sports bar, but it's a good one. I think the staff was a little overwhelmed on NY's day and the upcoming game, but they ralleyed and the food more than made up for everything. We had the animal fries and burgers. I loved my burger. They have some nice combinations. I'm glad they don't have one of these in my hood, but if anyone is in the area, check it out!"
5,"It's hard to believe that I hadn't written a review for Lon's yet. We are somewhat regulars (at least once a month) for many years. During the spring and fall, the Patio is a hot reservation. And I mean...call a few days in advance hot. \n\nI enjoy Sunday evenings at Lon's. Typically, they offer a price fixe menu and have different delicious meats (whole pig anyone?) roasting on a spit. \n\nSaturday evenings offer a live band, and is great for evening dining. \n\nIf the patio is crowded and we don't have a reservation, we are happy to dine at the bar. \n\nI always recommend Lon's to out of town guests. Tasteful, charming, a former artists residence, it gives a great taste of the Southwest in a well-appointed setting.\n\nAbout the food? My favorites on the menu? Jidori Chicken (and I don't usually order chicken...BUT...this chicken is Amazing!); truffle macaroni and cheese, any of their fish selections. And the dessert: The Cowboy candy bar. You're welcome."
5,"Super friendly staff serving fantastic food and you can't beat the 50-cent cup of coffee - hot or iced! Great vibe - lots of regulars making their required pre-work stop or hanging out on the weekends. I love their baked goods - unique flavors for scones, muffins and cookies!"
5,"Great service and excellent food. We had our server pick out the entire meal and he did a fantastic job. We started with endives with mandarin almonds and something else I can't remember. We had croquettes serve in a shoe...they were amazing but the show was weird...apparently the chef trying to be cute....but kind of tacky but I guess that flys here in sin city.  We also got shrimp, steak and bruschetta which were all equally amazing but our favorite was the carne asada steak. The dessert was the French toast and was awesome. I would recommend jaleo to even my most picky foodie friends . Again the service was so good it rivaled the best in NYC."
5,"Dr. Libby and Dr. Beanstalk are AMAZING!  Dr. Libby is amazingly kind and loving.  They are WONDERFUL with children.  I thought this even BEFORE my son fell and broke one of his front teeth in 4 pieces.  Dr. LIbby was closed and came right in and had to extract the pieces while we held him down (because he had eaten and was 18 mo. old he couldn't have anything but a local).  This part just says it all....I began singing Itsy Bitsy Spider to calm him and Dr. LIbby didn't miss a beat and joined in while holding his head and working.  And he assistant chimed right in.  It was a horrific experience until we were in Dr. Libby's hands.  I loved her BEFORE this happened because she was OUTSTANDING with my daughter, and the episode with my son sealed the deal.\n\nTHERE IS NO NEED to go to any other pediatric dentist.   I wish I could give them 100 stars because this practice and the people who work there deserve it!"
5,"My husband is from Raglan, NZ and he said Lola's had the best lattes he has ever had! My mocha was delicious too :) chocolate didn't over power the coffee.\n\nIf you get there early, they usually have banana bread or zucchini bread that tastes yummy."
5,I am very picky when it comes to who cuts my hair. So I read the reviews about this place on yelp. I decided to give it a try. Let me tell you I was very impressed. Nick did one awesome job on my hair and was very friendly. He squared the back and broke out the straight razor for my neck. All in all it was the best haircut I ever got. Go see the guys here they are awesome
5,"I had such an amazing experience at this salon!!\n\nThey had a special featured on Groupon for their Amnesia Retreat hot stone massage for $39, which is normally $90.  Also, all the proceeds went to a cancer charity which I thought was awesome that the salon was doing something like that.  \n\nI had a great experience from the minute I walked into the door.  The salon receptionist was a guy who was very friendly and professional.  He had a glass of water waiting for me.  They were right on time with my appointment.  My massage was with Tweety (Her real name is Thuy).  She is AMAZING!!!  She was so kind, cute, & really down to earth.  Sometimes I feel a little uncomfortable getting a massage from people, but not her.  She made me feel 100% comfortable!  I also had never had a hot stone massage before.  It is definitely an magical feeling.  I loved every second of it and didn't want it to end.  \n\nThe only downfall about this salon for me, is that I live on the exact opposite end of the city of it's location, but after an experience like that, I wouldn't mind making the drive back out there!! \n\nThanks Amnesia Salon!"
5,"Awesome rolls! Awesome service!! The waitresses are very friendly and the food is fresh! Ask for the sushi tostada! It not on  the menu but it's amazing! My favorite was the Kimmy roll, my husband's, the almost hot roll.  (We think that was the name)"
5,"I absolutely love this gym. The staff is always friendly! It's always really clean in here! The trainers are very knowledgable and have a genuine concern for all of their clients. \n\nI am a fan of the \""No towel, no workout\"". I wish there was a full basketball gym but still very accommodating. \n\nI love the cardio theater is amazing! Very great experience for those who need a little distraction while their running.\n\nCheck this place out!"
5,"Very friendly staff, nice clean place.  Spacious.  Definitely a stop when I go visit family in Scottsdale.\n\nTypical Chinese takeout fare:\n\n-Egg roll.  OMG!  Finally, an egg roll like back home in NYC.  Seems like in Vegas, they call spring rolls, egg rolls.  YUMMY!\n\n-Wor Won Ton Soup (w/chicken breast, shrimp, beef, cabbage, mushrooms, broccoli).  This is the best Won Ton soup I've had since leaving Astoria, NY where Nuevo Jardin has top honors.\n\n-Sesame Chicken - not great, but good enough to finish a large order.\n\n-Mongolian Beef - So good I didn't even get to taste it.  Everyelese did though and loved it.\n\n-Happy Family - Very good.  All the ingredients were fresh.  It made my family very happy.\n\n-Combination Fried Rice - Very good.  Not quite as good as what I'm used to from back East, but very tasty and moist."
5,"Amazing place. We were out killing time until our dinner reservations at a different place. Read the reviews and had to stop in for a drink. Place was very busy. Great looking food was coming out that almost made us want to get an appetizer. As other people noted on here, the secret bathrooms were very cool! Then the toilets are kind of hidden in there too. Just grab the door handles when inside. A must visit place if your looking for an upbeat place. You want to dress up here too."
5,"Absolutely the best! We were married there by \""Elvis\"" and had a fantastic time. 38 people from Connecticut flew out there for the wedding and all said it was the best wedding they ever attended. The entire staff was friendly and professional. Special thanks to Olivia for her hard work and attention to detail. There was nothing cheesy or tacky about our wedding, it was fun and beautiful."
5,This place is a hidden gem in Chandler.  I was refered by a coworker and brought 3 friends my first time it was amazing $30 for an hour.  we all have gone back on a regular basis a must to go and relax...
5,"Let me get this out of the way first..  They sell Pacquiao t-shirts!!\n\n\nAnyways, Manila Sunrise has always been my go-to place for Filipino products.  They even have fishball sauce there!  Can you believe that?!  Where else in the East Valley can you get authentic Filipino fishball sauce?\n\n\nTheir products are fairly priced.  Some, I'd even consider cheap.  Yeah, a handful of those products are also sold at LeeLee's, but they are all cheaper at Manila Sunrise.\n\n\nYou want fried chicken skins?  Chicharon?  Chippy?  Clover Chips?  Sarsi in glass bottles?  Tocino?  Longanisa?  Filipino themed apparel?  They have it all there at Manila Sunrise.\n\n\nThe people that work there are pretty cool too.  They really appreciate the patronage you give them."
5,"After waiting nearly an hour to pay and line up for Wicked Spoon buffet, I ran over to Va Bene Caffe, in heels, at that, to satiate my growling tummy. \n\nEverything in Vegas is expensive, but this food was DARN good. I ordered the blueberry muffin on two different occasions. It's the first I've had with a crispy exterior and a soft interior. SOOO GOOD!! The hot cocoa is what we call \""CoCocaine,\"" because it's sooo rich and delicious that it's addictive!\n\nMy server was so sweet and open with recommendations. I also love the look of the place -- very modern. You can't go expecting much, but a darn good snack. Yum!"
5,"This is by far the best hotel brunch buffet I've ever had and my wife agrees! So many item to choose from, crazy. Stay away if you're trying to stay lean for the pool area :-) ... If you're staying at the cosmopolitan make sure you get breakfast included since you don't wanna miss out! Open for brunch between 8am-2pm which makes it perfect for everybody staying in Vegas."
5,I truly LOVE Vegas Hot!! I have tried a couple other hot yoga studios and Vegas Hot is by far my favorite! I love all the different types of classes they offer. I love mixing it up and Vegas Hot is perfect for that!! They have a wide variety of Quick and to the point classes & they also have longer classes. It just suits my ever changing crazy schedule perfectly! They are also very affordable and always offering a wide variety of money saving deals constantly.  I also prefer the flooring in the Vegas Hot rooms. I highly recommend Vegas Hot! They offer a free week just for you to try!
5,"First visit here was last night with my parents (in from out of town). We originally went to Houston's and there was a 1hr wait... so we walked right across the parking lot, and were seated immediately at Veneto Trattoria (it was busy, just not packed).\n\nOne of the best Italian restaurants I have ever visited. I love that this is right in my neighborhood too! The prices are very reasonable, the food is delicious, and the service impeccable. \n\nI enjoyed the pork chop, while my guests tried seafood, pasta, and salads. Everyone was very pleased with the experience.\n\nPlan on making this a regular stop."
5,"I have visited his Bistro many times and have never been disappointed. The atmosphere and the servers have always been professional, helpful and they have a great laid back attitude. Our best experience has been with a server named Tim. His personality was over the top and made for a fabulous visit. On this last visit we had the stuffed mushroom appy which was great! I opted for a dinner salad with chicken and the sweet serrano dressing which I love. My friend had the margherita pizza and there were no complaints. We sat and chatted for quite a long time and never felt hurried by the staff to turn the table. One of my favorite places to go for great food with friends."
5,"Love this mall. The food court sucks but it's a food court at a mall, not meant to be fancy. One tip to help you save money.....take the monorail to LVH then at LVH get in their cab line and take a cab to the mall. Your fare should be around $15 plus tip. One time it was 10:05 and Puma had not opened yet. A lady got all belligerent over it. It was shopping and a show."
5,"Tiny hole-in-the-wall...two tables that can seat 2 people each, and then a small counter.  Most of the kitchen is right before your eyes--so you can see how they prepare the food.\n\nThe food here?  Absolutely top-notch.  Very fresh.  Muchisimo sabor!!!  The hot salsa here is so flavorful, I couldn't stop eating it even when my face was burning.  Lots of fresh avocado, onion, cilantro, everything was so good and balanced just right."
5,"I love this place!\n\nAs silly as it sounds, I love drinks that come in cool containers and I've been wanting to try their 1L mason jar cocktails for the longest time. Came here around 5 pm on a Thursday which was perfect because an hour later, it was packed. It's a very small bar and it's since it's located right in front of a cegep there are always students abound. As others mentioned, they are strict on ID. My friend and I are in our mid twenties but immediately got carded at the door.\n\nFor 17$, their large mason jar drinks are well priced, you also get 3$ off during happy hour. The Chupa Chupa, mango based drink was my favorite. Each drink ingredient is clearly listed on the menu along with a 1 to 5 scale to measure its intensity.\nI noticed on their menu booklet that it was dated October to December 2013 so I'm assuming they change their selection every now and then.\n\nAnother fun perk is that they give free Goldfish crackers to munch on.\n\nOnly thing that would make this place better would be free wifi and if they accepted debit. There do have an ATM though."
5,"This place is what makes Montreal smoked meat very popular, and is the essence of every Montreal visit.\n\nEveryone has mentioned the flavour of the smoked meat, but the rib steak is awesome as well! I'd highly recommend the Schwartz's combo if you're hungry, filled me up to the point I had to take the rest of it home!\n\nDefinitely recommend this place. It may be touristy, but there's a reason why."
5,"I don't normally write reviews but this is one of my favorite salons in Arizona. The whole staff is super friendly and very professional. I get my cut and color with Milana. She's so cute and friendly, it's a blast every time I go. She's one of the only people I trust with my hair. She's even thorough with my deep conditioning. Love this place, can't wait for my next appointment."
5,"Really like this place- good food, nice employees, and fast delivery! We have dined in several times and it's nothing fancy, but our waitress was super nice and we have had only good experiences here"
5,"Super deal for lunch or dinner. Located on the light rail line in Tempe east of ASU campus, this grocery store / restaurant combo serves up some excellent Mediterranean food. Pita sandwiches are more than enough food for one for lunch or dinner, and if you are feeling extra hungry get a dinner plate with entree, Greek salad and rice. Everything made fresh in-house. The hummus is  as you would expect, but for something different try the eggplant baba ganaoush."
5,I booked an hour massage here with Claudio. I work as a barber so I like to get massages regularly for my shoulders and legs. Claudio has a degree in sports & exercise science so he knows muscles inside and out. He worked muscles I had never felt before. It is INTENSE but I have never felt this awake or relaxed. Highly recommended.
5,"On the recommendation of a friend, my wife and I went to Comedor Guadalajara for supper.  I can't pronounce it but I found it.\n\nIt doesn't look like much on the outside, but it is quite comfortable and nicely done inside.  From the chips and salsa at the start to the blazing hot main course, the food was great.\n\nI had a burrito, taco and cheese enchilada combo plate with rice and refried beans on the side.  The burrito was huge and tasty, the taco crisp and filled with fresh lettuce, and the rice and refried beans were tasty. The enchilada was so-so and it was the only disappointment.\n\nThe service was fair, a little disappointing given that it was not that busy.\n\nThe price is excellent for the food you get.  A real value!"
5,"I love this buffet, it has a ton of food and its very good.   And I love it more because since i'm a local i get 50% off the regular price, You can't beat that.     Love It!!!!!!!"
5,"Wow what a relief.  Was afraid I was going to end up in some crappy Vegas buffet. You find yourself walking through downtown Vegas certain that you are NEVER going find a decent place for Dinner and stumble into the Fremont, poke your head into the Second St Grill and instantly you know you are in a good place.  The service and food are OUTSTANDING.  I am a steak snob and the Rib eye here was better the the one I had at the Billagio, no I am not kidding.  The staff makes you feel comfortable, were very attentive and knowledgable.  Very clean, unlike the tpyical downtown places and even compared to the Fremont Casino.  The menus has a great selection, steak seafoods, pastas, salads.  We had dinner for two without drinks for $55.  Not a downtown fan at all but I would make the trip again just to eat here.  A nice break from the street circus."
5,When a car accident happens and repairs are needed many hands are working on the vehicle and sometimes confusion and lack of communication ensues. NOT at INVISION! From start to finish the process is seamless. Communication is never lost as I have found in the past. What a great group of people to trust with my damaged car.
5,"My husband took me here last month as a surprise for my birthday. The most unique experience ever and I was pleasantly surprised! I never had Moroccan food before, so I was a bit nervous. I also never experienced a 6 course meal before. This place blew my mind. The meal is set so there is no guessing over a menu on which items to order.The ambiance is amazing, its romantic, the food was delicious, and the experience is unforgettable. They even have a friendly belly dancer  that entertains you throughout your meal.\nGreat place to go for special occasions. Pricey, but you get what you pay for!"
5,Love this place I always buy my boys clothes shoes and socks from here and all the little extra stuff. The staff is so nice and helpful they rock
5,"I went to Sumits for the first time today because I purchased a Groupon for the studio.  I had an excellent experience!  The studio is large, clean and comfortable.  The class was different from what I am used to but the instructor was nice and helpful.  I liked the progression and flow of the class!  Can't wait to go back!"
5,"Winning!  \nHeavy D (imperial Devils Ale) & The Sonoran Dog together is simply Heaven!\nLOCAL BREW, Great Food & a Great Atmosphere combine to make one hell of an experience.  Did I mention that its in a really cool part of town as well?  YOU MUST GO!"
5,I believe this is the correct location..this is for the Port of subs on Stephanie and Sunset by Wells Fargo...either way. \n\nMy husband and I came in to Port of Subs and we were SO surprised by the amazing service we received! Usually you don't expect to have a conversation with the person who is making your food or to be greeted warmly or to be thanked. It was a shock! Not only that but the meat and cheese was prepared right there so there was no watery residue on my sandwich ( much nicer than subway). We will be continuing customers! Thank you!
5,"It doesn't get better than this! This place is a beckoning oasis in a desert of...well...in an actual desert. \n\nThey have a mind-boggling selection of wine, beer and spirits at EXCELLENT prices. We've been duped by good prices at Trader Joe's and Bev Mo and what we've learned is if it seems like they've priced it like it was stored badly or fell off the truck--it probably was, and probably did. We found prices at Total Wine that are better than wine club member prices for high end wineries like Chimney Rock, Duckhorn, Rombauer, Pine Ridge etc...and the wine is GOOD. It's FINE. It tastes the way it would taste at the winery. Nothing bad has happened to it. They're just able to make great deals on fabulous wines. \n\nJust think, if you're lucky enough to live near one of these stores you're getting better wine buys than wine club members! That said, I still would NOT move to Vegas. Blech! But if you already live here or are just visiting, it's totally worth a stop to stock up the cellar.\n\nYou don't have to die to go to wine heaven, but you do have to go to Vegas."
5,"i got a really good trim of the beard, probably the best I have had. The prices are a tad high, but are totally worth it considering both the high quality of the work and the customer service."
5,"This is my home away from home. I probably would have been ashamed to say this in the past, but I'm a regular, and I'm damn proud of it. This place is wonderful, granted you can find a place to sit. Don't get me wrong, there are a couple dozen tables, but it gets busy, and it gets busy often. I always get the coffee of the day; today it's a creme brulee. Sometimes it's a chocolaty blend from Nicaragua or something strong from Peru. I'm probably making this up. There's Wi-Fi, obviously. There's a decent food selection, too. I love their pita and hummus. They also have Everything bagels, which I like lightly toasted and plain. I get weird looks when I tell them to hold the butter and cream cheese. Anyway, what really makes this place great is the staff. Hands down--the friendliest bunch of baristas in town. I have no shame in spending every waking hour in this coffee shop. I get all my work done, and I see friendly faces. I feel like one of them. Lol. Okay, I'll stop now. Try the latte or the tea. Great selection of herbal teas--my goodness. Excellent stuff."
5,"Oh My Gawd ! Sooo delicious ! This is a Las Vegas Landmark.  Old school Vegas entertainers dine there (I always hope to spy one!!) & its so cozy!\n$65.95 for a couple !!!!!!\nHell yes ! We had the 1.5 pound lobster each, salad, garlic bread, baked potato, ear of corn & a BOTTLE of wine.  Bargain !\n\nNow for those of you classy folk that have written 1 star reviews of this place.If you are offended by bargains, smoking, or Vegas 1970's style.  Get in your Prius, drive your WASP ass down to Green Valley or Town Square.  Probably there, someone   will give 2 shits about your cardiovascular health & whether your veggies came from Costco or not.  Sorry there wasn't a yard boy picking your veggies fresh for you. \n\nThe Staff was superb.  Rose was a fantastic waitress.  She even cracked my Lobster claws for me...since I'm not real smart like that.  She \""field stripped\"" them faster than anything Id ever seen.  \n\nI'm going to try Pups on the Patio next."
5,This place deserves a 5 star rating. We came to try their AYCE and we were not disappointed. Everything was delish except for the Yakisoba. I thought I ordered a Soba style dish and it wasn't. But what do you expect? This is a SUSHI place for heaven's sake!!
5,"Bill is the first person you want to call. After figuring out we had a problem with our pool, Bill was at our door within minutes. He worked efficiently to fix our problem and went above and beyond in terms of his service and hospitality - all at a great rate. I would definitely recommend Bill to anyone needing pool repair."
5,"My 2001 Audi was having a lot of trouble (AC not working, wiper fluid by deploying, trunk hatch broken) and I went to Zimbrick to have it evaluated-- the bill was over $1000 to have everything replaced. I brought my car over to Dunn's and they quickly realized that a few things needed to be adjusted, and nothing needed to be replaced at all! Could have charged me just short of my previous estimate but the bill was tiny. Earned my trust. And they we're incredibly accommodating with my unaccompdaying schedule. Have been bringing my vehicles here, and recommending heavily, ever since."
5,"This place is GREAT. There are plenty of options in LINQ, but for a quick bite to hit the spot, come here.\n\nWe came in minutes before closing, and got no flack from the staff. One star. I asked for a veggie dog and they told me anything on the menu could be a veggie dog. Two more stars. The food was quick, the beer was perfectly priced, and it was super convenient. One more star. Then...I tasted my haute hot dog treat. And there's not enough stars to go around.\n\nI got the Windy City dog. With its celery salt, neon green relish, perfect size and mouth warming goodness, it was EVERYTHING. I went to Berkeley (go bears!) and coming here was like coming home to Top Dog. I was in Haute Heaven.\n\nStop by and try it. They close a little early for Vegas, but there's never a bad time for a dog."
5,"This was a fantastic dinner we had at this rest. that we stumbeled into  as we exited Ka Show at MGM! It was about 9 PM and we just walked in! Got seated in about 10 min ( no reservation) \nI had pork chop (xlnt) my husband had some kind of a steak ( he loved it ) we split a salad ( very good ) \nThey even had Stella on tap !!! Service was efficient, pleasant and professional.\nSpeciality cheeze cake for desert was awesome!\nCan't wait 2 go back!"
5,"Old Fashioned was the first restaurant I visited when I moved to Madison - and after a year of touring all of the tastiness that this city has to offer - Old Fashioned is still my favorite. \n\nMaybe it's the cheese curds, which are hands-down my favorite curds on the isthmus. That paprika dipping sauce is pure YUM.\n\nMaybe it's the atmosphere. Old Fashioned is always bustling - making for a heck of wait for a Friday/Saturday dinner - but it's a worthwhile wait. Old Fashioned has this sort of \""laidback energy\"" I've come to associate with the city.\n\nMaybe it's the food. From the Mac and Cheese to the Fish Fry and for every burger and brunch item in between, the food is just good. All of it. All the time. \n\nMaybe it's the drinks. My first time at Old Fashioned, the bartender let us sample a whole flight of local microbrews. This is where my love affair with Lake Louie's Scotch Ale began. \n\nBut maybe I like Old Fashioned so much because it's the kind of place I can take out-of-town guests for a slice of the Madison experience. Or at least my Madison experience: Good food. Good people. Good drinks. And most importantly, good cheese."
5,"Stopped in to Gallaghers before our Cirque du Soliel show at the N.Y N.Y.\nWe started the meal with a shrimp scampi app. \nMy husband had the Cesar and I had the gazpacho, which was amazing. \nWe also had the shrimp scampi for an app. It had a delicious warm spicy sauce..not your usual butter scampi sauce... \nI ordered the queen cut prime rib, and Ben had the surf and turf with the hugest lobster I've ever seen. \nI hardly put a dent in my prime rib..It was huge. I wish I could have taken it with me. \nWe also had the lobster mashed potatoes and creamed spinach, both were awesome but we could not finish. \nThe servings here are HUGE.\nThe food was excellent for the money (I think this meal would have cost me more at home in S.F.)  I think our total was around $200 before tip..not bad..\nThe highlight of our meal was our server Norman. \nNorman's service was phenomenal. I hope he is working  next time we are visiting."
5,"AZ Celebrity DJ is the best in their industry. Looking forward to including them in more events. Stephanie, Juan and Joe are awesome, their attention to detail is amazing.."
5,"i rarely get filled up off of 2 slices of pie. but pizza rock did it for me. \n\nwe walked here from staying at a near by hotel and had a craving for pizza, this place came highly recommended from the locals here, walking into this place had great scenery, i was quite surprised of the entry. they had a pick up and to-go window in the front and the restaurant in the back of the place. \n\nthey have tv's everywhere for all the sport that your into and they play music videos with stars chiming in to them. \n\nthis place has a full bar. and great discounts during happy hour which is always a plus. \n\nthe food here is great. started off with the salad with blue cheese dressing. there dressing here is fantastic is your a salad fan. te waitress made sure that we had everything that we needed at all time. if another waitress saw that we were looking up for someone they would come help even if it wasnt there table. very polite and very helpful. not what you would expect for casual dining.\n\nwe had the classic pizza with a few added different toppings, the taste, the bite, the over all experience was just perfect. i was very pleased coming here and experiencing the food as well as the service.\n\ni would highly recommend this pizza rock to anyone in the area, locals or just passing through. great place for friends, family, and large groups, kids as well"
5,Chris was a great instructor. Wet track makes it really easy to learn. Chris is really thorough and explains things in a really easy way to understand for someone who doesn't know anything about driving on a track.\n\nThey have another track that is also great for those who already know what they're doing.\n\nThanks U-Drift!!
5,"I've been to clubs all over the world, Paris, Seoul, Quito, Shanghai, Taipei, NYC, and this place is that next level shit. If it's an experience you want, a blown mind is what you'll get. It's the MC  Escher of nightclubs, it'll change your reality of the club experience. The DJ is absolutely legit, the dancers and entertainers are top notch. The volume is just loud enough to enjoy but won't obliterate your cochlear. Overall the best club in Vegas, hands down."
5,YUMMY! The pasta was very well done. The shrimp were larger than I expected and blended well with the cheese sauce. Definitely better than Olive Garden any day of the year.
5,Amazing night at the bar Becky was incredible. She made my wife a special drink based on one of her recipes.  She totally went the extra mile.
5,"SO very impressed with the student stylist I had, Chelsea is great! I got a relaxer, trim, blow dry, and straighten. I have had my hair done by various salons, and stylist however, this BY far is the best experience I have had. It's a little noisy (the students are young and having fun) but the work was great. I'll definitely be back!"
5,"I was so excited to see a new French Bakery come to the neighborhood.  I found my new favorite hangout for coffee and pastry.  YUM!!! It did not disappoint.  And, the employees are so nice.  Welcome, La Belle Terre...thanks for tempting my taste buds.  I can't wait to come in for lunch."
5,"C&R Tire is an amazing shop with friendly, professional people.\n\nLast night I noticed a screw in my tire. I managed to limp home on my donut, but knew it would not be safe to drive down the highway to work this morning.\nI found C&R online and noticed they opened at 7. At 6:45 I called and Tracy picked up, helping me to find the shop. From the get-go she was extremely friendly and I felt like I would be in good hands.\n\nWhen I arrived, they quickly got me up and running in about half an hour. The friendly people at C&R even put my donut back in the car and secured all of my parts that I had out when I jacked the car up last night. \n\nThese are great people doing a great job. I will be back every time I need work done with the car."
5,"My wife and I visit Las Vegas 2-3 times a year and always look for and usually find, a new restaurant that we end up liking a fair amount. But this visit was different - we found Soho and fell in love.  Both of us felt it was the best overall Japanese meal we've ever had.\n\nEach of the dishes we ordered - and I'd have to say there were really too many - were superb. The highlights - the salmon and the whitefish sashimi and the Twin Dragon Roll.  There are simply too many good things to say about each of the dishes but suffice to say, it was the best.\n\nThe service matched the food - terrifically casual, friendly and knowledgeable server with the willingness to let us know what she liked as well as what was popular.  We took her suggestions and were ecstatic!\n\nI highly recommend this gem of a restaurant - get there soon before they move up and out because they definitely deserve to."
5,"Ate here again for my birthday last week.   Just can't get away from the food.   The fish is very fresh, and cooked just right.   If available, find one of the 4 tables downstairs in the small bar.  There is no doubt this is the place to wind down from a busy week."
5,"This pharmacy is exactly what it should be! It is a national chain, so if you're on vacation and you run out of your prescription, you can pick it up at any other CVS with a quick transfer. Sure, you are not going to receive the consultation that you would receive with a community pharmacy, but all I need is a pharmacy that will get prescriptions ready whenever I need them. They does just that very well here. The staff are always very nice too, rushed, but still nice."
5,"This place has the best food around. The people here are kind the service is quick and well the tacos are awesome especially the shredded beef ones. Oh the rice and beans are out if this world. I highly recommend. Oh and Friday nights are the best. There is free mariachis on Friday nights and the atmosphere is fun and more fun without the pressure of \""pick-up\"" night at the other establishments. Oh, did I mention the food is great? And the people are fantastic, kudos to the cooks, the servers and the owner are all great--I highly recommend this place to anyone with a heart and a sense of fun."
5,"This is hands down our favorite sushi restaurant. My friends and I have been coming here for over 8 years and have never been disappointed. Can't beat an all day happy hour Mon-Thurs. Great food, service, and the prices are reasonable!"
5,Mac n cheese dog is incredible.  This place is small and gets packed so be prepared for a long wait and no personal space.
5,"Ruth.... You have turned me into a blonde bombshell. There is nothing this lady can't do. I've been coming here since December, and every 8 weeks I am happy as a clam. We've been transitioning me from deep red to blonde (tough challenge), but she goes out on a limb and aces it every time. I've been getting compliments all week! I'm thinking of making my blue-haired sister drive all the way from Flagstaff for Ruth's amazing color correction... I'm sure she could figure something out! lol :) Thank you Ruth! You're amazing!"
5,"I was happily surprised by this restaurant!\n\nService was good.\n\nDrinks were EXCELLENT.\n\nFood ranged from okay to great:\nHot rocks: very nommy, enjoyed this one a lot\nAdult tater tots: I was not a fan but my husband liked this. I liked the texture/crunch but thought it was rather bland.\nCaesar salad with a side of salmon: Salad was fresh and salmon was perfectly cooked\nChicken: VERY TASTY and moist. Probably the favorite. \nDessert: Banana cream thingy, EXCELLENT!"
5,"Top-notch customer service here!\n\nI didn't use the self storage, but I rented a Penske truck from this location. From start to finish, the communication was great and the service was exceptional. When I arrived the morning of the rental, the owner had it parked outside for me and everything was ready to go. He verified the condition of the truck, explained the best practices for driving it, and even threw in some free furniture pads. I had requested a hand truck and it was already in the truck. All the equipment was in top-notch condition.\n\nThis experience stood in sharp contrast to the times I have rented from U-Haul or Budget. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this location."
5,"Best coffee in town. Friendly staff and free wifi! Large cafe with plenty of seating and non-pretentious atmosphere. Good prices, $2.50 for a cappuccino."
5,"This place could easily be my 2nd home!  Great, cold (29 degree) beer, friendly staff and a man cave with huge tv's. oh yea... The food is good too. Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed."
5,"Went last night to celebrate my birthday with 6 other friends and family. First of all, I want to apologize to the other patrons that were sitting near us because after 4 of their WONDERFUL chocolate martinis I probably was pretty loud too.I wasn't wearing a hat though. The food was wonderful as always especially since we started with the dessert and went from there. Jeremy also was our server and he couldn't have been more adorable.After  I got my birthday hug I personally don't think he plays on any other team then the girls.:)) The staff made the whole experience even more enjoyable for me. thank you. thank you thank you to the whole Melting Pot crew"
5,"Love this Starbucks! They make my Passionfruit Iced Tea Lemonade just the way I like it (the ones in California could never quite do it right :/)! The staff are friendly, helpful and attentive."
5,"Bought three juices from this store because after trying the juice bar, I got hooked. The flavors were amazing. Had to cop me the lychee and jolly rancher melon. I forgot the name of the last flavour I bought but oh well. They are a top notch vape shop. Id come back just to try the flavors again. Cool location, big store. Very friendly and gives great advice to beginners like me."
5,"Do your friend's a favor, and bring them here for lunch or dinner. I've turned on 2 more people this week. They are both planning their next pizza's. \n\nHint: they will do half and half, so pick two pizzas in one. \n\n\nIf it's bad it's your fault. \n\n10 stars!"
5,"I went as a walk-in on a random Wednesday.  Tom was busy, but he squeezed me in.  In about 15 minutes and with very little direction from me I had the tighest fade this side of the Mississippi.  It was pretty neat just to watch him work.  He's truly a master at what he does and I regret every dollar I've ever spent at those bargain \""value\"" chains where the stylists are typically a revolving door of mediocrity.  I challenge you to find a better cut for $14."
5,"Everyone loves Chick-fil-A's chicken sandwiches (and they are pretty damn good) but the service here is friendly and the place is just damn spotless clean.  The men's can even has some kind of dried flower arrangement, is this a fast food joint or a sushi bar?\n\nDon't rely on the stupid google map for directions, this place is actually south of 202 at E. Ray Road.  I never trust that idiotic GPS stuff anyway."
5,"I LOVE THIS BUS!\n\nI am soooo happy this is available! I live right down the street so I just take this bus when we fly! Its only 2$ for one trip or 5$ for 24hr pass! I sometimes take this bus to Vegas StrEATS bc its super convenient! If you ride this bus and bring your car they let you leave it there during your trip! Talk about saving money! It is usually there every hour about 10-15mins past it. it runs all day and night. It stops at Fremont, the Bonneville transfer, the outlet mall, and Tropicana. Its super easy to use and it takes about an hour to get to level zero at the airport.\n\n\nWe are going to Colorado next week and we will def be taking this baby to the airport and back!"
5,"BYOW & Beer was amazing. They give you a ice jug for your alcohol too. Awesome food, big portions. A little expensive- but then again you aren't spending a bunch of money on booze. Would definitely go again."
5,"David is amazing! I've been having pain issues with my neck, shoulder and ankle for a long time. He spent considerable time, getting to know my pain issues, showed me several exercises to strengthen my muscles and talked with me through the session, explaining what he was doing and how the muscles relate to each other. I like that he made education a part of the therapy treatment by teaching me simple, effective methods that I can implement at home. For the first time in months, I can move my neck without pain and the 'knots' are gone. I've had massages before but David is a true professional, extremely knowledgable and seemed to find every kink. \nI highly recommend him!"
5,"All I can say is that this is the best buffet I ever had in Vegas...each dish tasted like it wasn't cooked for the masses but came from a fine dining restaurant. The Wynn buffet ruined all the other buffets for me. I totally loved their cheese, charcuterie, dried fruits and olives selection...it made me very happy to find cerignola olives (olives as big as my thumb) as part of their offerings. mmmm cheese and olives....\n\nAlso I loved their king crab legs- fresh not too salty...just so tasty and so finger lickin good with some lemon and a dip in that warm butter. I was also surprised that I liked the lamb. Im not a lamb person but theirs were cooked perfectly and not gamey at all. I was even impressed that they had a panang station where you order what ingredients you want to add in your panang and that they offer tandoori and naan bread. I dont think I have seen panang and tandoori offered in any other buffets, this was an unexpected surprise. \n\nAll in all, my family and I think that this is the best buffet...I don't think I can go to any other buffet after this. LOVE IT and definitely a MUST TRY!"
5,Friendliest waiter I've had in a while.  Mom is in the back cooking and has been cooking for her different restaurants for 20+ years.   \n\nPho was even complimented by my picky 8 & 12 year olds.  LARGE servings of pho and also noodle dishes.
5,I eat eggs but I'm not a fan of them.  Today I had the best eggs ever on the Brunch Flat Bread at Timo's.  Now I understand why people eat eggs.  The crust was remarkable.  The burrata cheese was a new taste surprise.  Fruit bowl was mostly cantaloupe but that was OK because the quality of the fruit was great.  Service was on point.  Loved the inside vibe.  Can't wait until it cools down to check out the outside vibe.  Only helpful hint...Mimosa was too tart.  Would have preferred more orange juice.  I was there with a brunch group and everyone else had great food too.
5,"I really enjoyed the medium-rare rib eye as it was seasoned and cooked to perfection, but what I enjoyed even more were the pork chops!  Bone in tender chops cooked barely pink covered in a delicious, light sauce.  I'm getting moist just thinking about it."
5,"Michael our waiter was a gent and knows his stuff. I had the prime rib and while it was a bit fatty it was absolutely amazing. Seasoned to perfection. \n\nI also had the pork belly mac and cheese bites which are very tasty and filling thus I left a few behind so I could eat my prime rib! The Caesar salad was pretty good too.  \n\nI was surprised at how quiet it was for peak season, hence I guess why they are resigned to excellent groupon deal which I availed of. The Jameson ginger weather cocktail was amazing too and really strong which I like as an Irishman! Beautiful white linen cloth tables and immaculately clean floor makes this restaurant look as well as taste the part."
5,"My boyfriend and I went to Bouchon for brunch on 9/19 and it was divine. The coffee, raspberry beignets (they do not scrimp on jelly!), croque madame, pommes frites, bacon (so much!), and french toast were unbelievable. The atmosphere was very relaxed and the staff were attentive and super friendly. We had a fantastic time and can't wait to head back."
5,"Moved December 2013 from Camden Del Mar Apts to a House 15 Minutes Away.  I am happy and satisfied! We moved all the little stuff ourselves in about 15 car trips, then relied on Warren's for the big furniture and a few heavy boxes.  Took 3 hours and charge of $390 (two men used for the move).\n\nThe guys worked quickly, They were right on time at 7AM.  They were careful with our stuff, no complaints, no damages.  The two guys were nice and polite as well.  \n\nI was most satisfied with how easily they were able to get out large couch out-  It did not fit thru doorway (we knew this from the move-in), and when I told them this they gladly were happy with suspending the couch off the balcony to get it out - Acted like this was no problem and not a big request at all (I think it was!!) -- anyways they got the couch out no problem which is great because we were worried we were going to have to saw it in half and ditch the couch.\n\nAlso the company is very Flexible. I called on Friday night at 7pm to book movers for the following Thursday and easily got an apt.  Then we were ready early for the movers and I called Monday to ask if I could reschedule for the very next day - Was not a problem at all - So thankful for that as we were excited to move into new house :)  Thank you Warren's!"
5,"A very concise, well designed museum that covers a scary/bizarre/reality topic. It is an affiliate of the Smithsonian and it shows in the quality of the place. Atomic testing is such a quirky topic filled with emotion: horror and fascination. The museum does a great job of juxtaposing these emotions while presenting the history of atmospheric and underground testing. Lots of hardware from that era combined with video presentations and personal stories. Particularly interesting are the views of people, such as tourists who actually enjoyed watching atmospheric tests from outside the casinos. It is very thought provoking while giving great insight into an unusual chapter of US history."
5,"It doesn't require many words to say how impressed I am with this place... flawless food, delicious espresso, friendliest staff of anywhere I've ever been, and always consistent in what they do. Beautiful atmosphere and decor, wouldn't change a thing."
5,"I finally decided to visit Grimaldi's this month, based on all the great reviews. Pizza was cooked perfectly!!! The crust was thin and crispy, like a cracker (my favorite). Service was great as well. Great place to hang out with your friends or for a night out with your family."
5,"I love coming here! The staff is fantastic, there's a huge chalkboard wall, candy, ice cream, shaved ice, drinks, plus water and ice of course. It's an amazing atmosphere. They have a wall filled with photos of customers. Best place to get great tasting water!"
5,I have been going to Ken's for about 3 years now.  They are always busy....because they do a great job and clients keep coming back!  They try to be as accommodating as possible due to high amount of customers.  I try to call ahead an make an appointment but don't expect them to deny a walk-in because I have an appoint with the tech in like 40 minutes.  I am not a patient person... 5-10 minute wait is fine and there was only one time that I walked out because I had already waited for 25 minutes.  The thing is.... they are so busy because they do a great job and they are all nice!  This is my regular nail salon so I try to schedule my mani/pedi on the off peak times of the week to reduce the unexpected wait times.  I really recommend this nail salon.
5,I love love love Smash burger. Everything is made fresh to order.\n\nTry the SIN CITY burger it divine.\n\nThe buns...omg the buns!!\n\nMust eat veggie frites with yummy ranch.\n\nEat HERE.. \n\nService is quick and friendly every time\n\nThat is all
5,"I had the sausage, egg & cheese on an english muffin for brunch today. I had it to go. The sandwich was large compared to your average breakfast sandwich at McDonalds or BK. Overall, it was great. Large egg and sausage patty with plenty of cheese. I ordered a coffee to go, which was decent coffee. The cafe had a nice clean atmosphere and the cashier was friendly."
5,"I can't say anymore than what has already been written.  My wife and I have stayed here on two separate occasions, and it will be very difficult to stay elsewhere the next time.  Bellagio is 5 stars all the way through.  Only thing I would change about the Bellagio is an update to the rooms.  Everything here is expensive though, so be prepared to spend some $$$.  Highly recommend.  Will probably try out one of the city center hotels, or Wynn or Venetian next go 'round."
5,"Chocolate and alcohol has never sat well with me. It may be from my unpleasant encounter with chocolate wine. Max Brenner definitely knows the right mix. My friend and I came 30 minute before happy hour, right in time. My friend got a chocolate martini called satisfaction and I got a chai tea infused with white chocolate ganache\n\nThe chocolatini was actually really good. If had a thicker consistency, kind of like a lighter milk shake\n\nThe chai tea was awesome too. They put if in a tea thing that you put on top of of the cup for the drink to come out. It was a lot more flavorful than other chai teas I usually get. If this wasn't in Caesars I would come here for a good chai.\n\nI forsure want to come back and try some other stuff."
5,Mob museum is very well thought out. You work your way down from the 3rd floor and it's very interactive. My girlfriend and I had a good time here. Very educational and cool at the same time. You may want to split the tour in half because it's said to take approx 3hrs and from what I remember you can go out n come back as long as you have your wristband on. Check on that prior! It shares history in a historical building! A must when your in Vegas to learn about old Vegas.
5,"Creative Formalwear is a tuxedo rental company that delivers to Vegas.  Need I say more?  Their staff is very friendly and easy to work with and the online catalog has a lot of different styles to choose from.  If you have any questions, you can call them and they'll help you out.  My tuxedo was delivered to my hotel with a complimentary pair of socks (which was perfect because I'd forgotten mine) and everything fit perfectly.  Two of the guys in our group rented their tuxedos in advance and flew with them to Vegas.  They saw how easy my rental was and they wished they had done the same.  Save yourself time, hassle and money and rent from these guys."
5,"This place is amazing!!! Absolutely one of the best burgers I've ever had. Those sweet potato tots are to die for. Several items are marked as spicy, but I don't recall the symbol next to the burger I ordered and it definitely was spicy. Luckily the waitress kept my drink filled the whole time. \n\nReally cool atmosphere, definitely fits in downtown Charlotte. Obviously it's hard to find parking, but if you want to spend a night downtown this is the place to eat. Its sophisticated but not too pricey. Will eat here again."
5,"I showed up from Sacramento, California with high anticipation from reviews, reputation and recommendation.  Twenty dollar cab ride from the strip as we approach I'm thinking... uh are you sure this is it?  I'm reassured as I wait in a 70's strip mall for the door to open as other cabs and streams of people begin to show before the doors open on a Monday evening.\n\nThe chicken wings had to have one of the best flavors I've ever tasted on wings in my life.  I could sit there and eat enough of those alone to get sick to my stomach.  Service was on par as this place steadily filled up.  Dishes came out fast to our table and the owner came out and snapped a photo upon request from our table.  Hey I'm no Joe Montana but I took a picture just like he did.  They are so humble towards people from all over the world who come to eat their food.\n\nOur table had some common dishes Americans are use to and everything met or exceeded expectations.  If you ever, ever are in Vegas and want Thai food this is the place.  They also have won consecutive national awards for their wine list.  I will remember this as champagne taste on a beer budget.  Absolute awesomeness!"
5,"I would have to say that this place is an Arizona 5-star yelp rating.  In NYC, this would be a solid 4.  That out of the way, I've been here 3 times now and can say that the fish has always been very fresh on all three visits.  The sake selection is great.  Our favorite is the one from Toyama, which is the hometown of the owner in Japan.  If you plan to go here frequently, you can buy a large bottle and they will save it for you.  There are two things that make this place much more pleasant to go to than Yasu.  The first is the originality in the menu items.  They have an orange tuna avocado with orange-mizo glaze that I love. Mo also makes a salmon avocado roll with and entire diced soft shell crab on top.  All three times, I have ordered the omakase here.  And all three times, I have had new menu items.  Also, all three times, I have sat at the bar which to me is a must if you are going to get omakase.  The second thing that makes this place officially my favorite sushi spot in AZ is the owner and chef, Mo.  He is really friendly and on our second visit he remembered us.  Because of him, the whole restaurant has a laid-back, friendly appeal unlike places like Roka-Akor and Yasu which have more of an arrogant flair.  This is definitely my favorite sushi joint in the valley.   Can't wait to go again."
5,"Didn't have time to try this restaurant this time.   I talked to the maitre d' on the phone trying to make a reservation, after he learned that i was mainly interested in sampling the oysters, he recommended me to come at happy hrs 2-6:30 for dollar oyster.  I appreciated his candor,  that's 5 star service right there.  I wish we had come to them instead of Joe's Seafood and Steak."
5,"Frank's doesn't do the pressure sales of added services etc. like Jiffy Lube and some others...   The place is clean, workers friendly, and they give complimentary beverages while you wait.  They cleaned my car inside and out and even left me a bottle of water in my beverage holder for the road.... nice touch"
5,"This place is fabulous! It saves me from having to order coffee online and wait for it to be shipped. Everybody who works here is super friendly and they always offer up a complimentary coffee, espresso or latte. If you own a Nespresso machine this is the best place to get your coffee. I have two (one espresso machine and one coffee machine) and wouldn't trade them for anything!"
5,"This used to be a Bobby McGees, which the waitress will probably tell you its your first time there.  The BBQ is some of the best I have ever had in my entire life!  Little speedy, but  not unreasonable & well worth it, if you are taking someone out for a nice dinner, you will be sure to please!   \n\nThey have outdoor and indoor seating, and a dance club setting.  It still retains some of its vibe from when it was Bobby McGee's, just modern.   To be honest, this change in format was the best thing that happened to Bobby McGees, because it was starting to feel stuck in the 1970s.  Bobby Q's is just plain awesome.\n\nI highly recommend them!"
5,I just relocated to the Phoenix area and have been looking for a grooming salon.  I took my 2 shihtzu's here last week for the first time after checking it out beforehand.  I was very impressed with how clean and quiet the salon was.  Not a lot of barking dogs and noise like many other salons.  I am very particular about my dogs grooming and well being.  They listened to how I wanted them clipped and they looked great when they were done!  Also I noticed my dogs were not nearly as nervous or anxious here when I took them in and when I picked them up!!  It was a great find and will definitely be taking my girls there again!!!
5,"The BF and I stayed here using his parents' timeshare. It was great! The location was perfect, very convenient and close to other hotels and casinos. It was quiet and our one bedroom villa was huge! We had a giant tub with jets...jets! The bed was large and comfortable and we also had a full kitchen. The place has a small rooftop pool and hot tub that are very nice and were, for the most part, not very busy. We had a great stay and would definitely come back!"
5,"We tried the teriyaki chicken and Asian spicy chicken. Both were very good!  If this was located a little closer to us, we'd definitely come back on a regular basis. Wide variety to choose from on the menu including crab puffs, edamame, etc. If I could rate 4.5 I would - the only downside is that it's small inside so not the most welcoming place to eat, but if you want something delicious on the go, this is it."
5,"Pete is the man! My pool is sparkling clean year round, he handles it all and I never have to worry about anything. So worth it!"
5,"This is the best Dunkin' Donuts I've ever been in town... Everybody who works in the morning is really cool, and always has the best customer service! I'll come back every day just because of them"
5,"This is the best Toyota dealership in town. If you are looking to buy, call Gay. She is AMAZING!! I will never buy a car from anyone else. We have purchased many cars from her and she always gives us great deals. \n\nWe love Toyota and have never bee disappointed with any of our vehicles. They are so reliable and they offer great service here. If you make an appointment, it is much better and you won't have to wait as long.\n\nBut it is a Toyota , and as long as you do regular required maintenance you should never have a problem and need major service. I highly recommend this dealership and Gay. You will love her and never buy a car anywhere else."
5,"I had so much fun at this place on a Friday night out!  \n\n1) No cover charge\n2) 3 rooms- different D.J's- music was good!\n3) Half naked men dancing on stage \n4) Most importantly I spent practically nothing on drinks.\n5) The dance floor was small but you have room to mingle.\n\nOverall a good time, good energy in the air, will definitely be going back!"
5,"Excellent club. I haven't had so much fun in a long time. The promoters are doing an excellent job. I credit them with keeping the club packed up until I left at 10am. I met a great guy btw, Anyone wanna drive down from LA? JK. LOL."
5,"This is a great place for a hike or a trail-ride and very affordable too. I know someone who had a wedding in the barn (yep, she's a horse person).  The barn wedding & reception would have been ok (it's a really nice barn) except that at the time it wasn't air-conditioned and was a litte too warm.   If you are not into barn nuptials, the Greenway still has lots to offer!"
5,"My husband and I ate here on our way home from Vegas. I looked for an Indian restaurant on Yelp with good reviews and Yelp saved the day again by leading us to this wonderful gem. They have meat, vegetarian and vegan options. The buffet was huge and delicious. Everything is clearly labeled whether it's vegan or vegetarian, too, which was so helpful. I could only wish to find this wonderful of a vegan friendly Indian restaurant in L.A. I am on the hunt! I will be eating here everytime I visit Vegas!"
5,Very good pizza and salad. Looking forward to having a pizza at dinner time to see how the flavor is after a full day of heat in the oven...
5,My whole family suffered from a bad stomach virus last weekend and I thought I got lucky and missed it! Well today I started vomiting and had a huge headache. After seeing Hangover Heaven bus around the area I decided to give it a try. Dr  bUrke came directly to my home within 45 min and hooked me up to an IV with anti nausea med. After 1 hour I felt 100% better and was worth every penny. Would def use again and is a great service for both tourists and residents who need to rehydrate and get rid of any nausea and hangover. Wish we thought of it when the family was sick last week
5,Awesome food.  The hanger steak is irresistable.  Really enjoy that they usually have live music and it's free.  Great beer selection and serves food late.\n\nUnfortunately it can get packed on some nights (popular bands/events) and hard to get a table or even seat at the bar.
5,"You notice right away how clean and fresh this place is.  Staffed by family members which made it feel very safe and friendly. Plenty of reasonably priced detergents etc. in the vending machines was convenient and plenty of parking too...fluff and fold was available,  I would use tlc again."
5,"Such an amazing addition the Fremont East.  This place exceeded all of my expectations.  Since it opened, I've been there literally every weekend.  No joke, I love it.  When I think of city pubs that brings a lot of culture, I think this place has it!\n\nWhen you look at the place from the outside, it doesn't look big.  When you walk in, you are quickly corrected.  This place is huge!  It's filled with such an array of uncommon things that somehow come together nicely.  I'm talking about mismatched chandeliers, weathered wood beams, zebra carpets, exposed brick walls, lots of over sized pictures.  This place has it all!  There's also two stairways leading to the roof top deck.  NICE.  I'm always a fan of roof top decks.  Lots of space to walk around, lots of room, lots of great company. \n\nWhen you come here, you MUST try the banana bread beer.  It is soo good.  Strong hints of banana bread flavor and not sweet, so it's great.  It's served in a large glass.  I'm so glad that they decided to brew their own beers.  So good!\n\nPlease take your butts downtown and try this place out.  It BLOWS the other bars out of the water on Fremont East.  Taken from their site, \""Commonwealth, a cocktail bar\nfor uncommonly good times.\""  I truly believe that."
5,"This place was awesome!  The service was great and very friendly.  We went for early dinner and had cheeseburger, fries, shakes, and biscuits and gravy.  Everything was really tasty, although diner-y, so you know it's probably not the best thing to eat every day.  Very well-priced (under $20 for all this good stuff) and close to campus.  Highly recommend."
5,"Such a peaceful and elegant place to have tea.  The restaurant is tucked away in a small corner of the Four Seasons Resort, which is connected to Mandalay Bay.  If you park in Mandalay Bay's lot you can easily walk there.  They do require 24 hours of advance notice, so book ahead.  They make some of the best scones I've ever had, and paired with one of their organic teas you can't go wrong.  The staff were extremely pleasant and accommodating...since I came at the end of tea time they even let me take some extra scones to go!\n\nPlease check out my full review here:  \nhttp://thirstyfortea.com/2013/07/09/tea-on-the-strip-verandah-las-vegas/"
5,"Tasty, good value sandwich selection.  Great coffee.  And I've just this morning discovered they make a mean bacon roll too, and I'm so fussy about bacon rolls I rarely buy them.  Very friendly staff."
5,The sushi chef is amazing! I don't understand why some people don't like this place I guess it depends on what they are comparing it to. The food is excellent and again the sushi chef is the best! I'd give them 10 stars if I could. I will be coming back!
5,"If you love sushi, this place is heaven! I am so glad I came across Hokaido because it is now my go-to sushi joint. I love the sushi chefs!!! They are AMAZING, I haven't even ordered off the menu the last couple times I have been there, I just let them make a one of a kind specialty roll and I have never been disappointed! \n\nThe sushi here is always good! The service is also very good. If you wanna impress someone take them here, the presentation of the sushi is phenomenal!!"
5,Menu has been updated and new owner really cares. My new favorite place at chandler fashion square to eat. They have grilled turkey and chicken which is awesome!  Love the food here and the staff is great!!
5,"I have seen La Nouba, Love, Mystere, Zumanity, Totem and O. They all get a 5 star review if you ask me but for the record this was my favorite. This particular show is fun and has lots of audience participation especially at the beginning of the show. In the Vegas area I think Zumanity is my favorite and when it comes to the traveling shows I really liked Totem but this is definitely one to put on your list as a must see."
5,Love that they are 24 hours and I dont have to go anywhere after my work out to grab a smoothie
5,This is the first restaurant that I have been to where I want to try everything on the menu.  I order something different every time. The service is good and the food is amazing!!  One of my favorite breakfast places!
5,My daughter got a groupon for her birthday this year to try archery (she just turned 7). From the moment we stepped through the door we were greeted by smiles and welcomes. She fell in love with the sport and every chance we get we take her down to practice. Not only do they make you feel comfortable and like family but they take time to make sure she's using good form and make her feel good about herself even if she misses and gets down on herself. Gabe and his staff are top notch and everyone I come across who's interested in archery gets referred to them because I know they'll get nothing but 5 star treatment. We love you guys! Sasha and shakira :-)
5,"O'Kelley's is a really fun bar. Great place to hear good bands. Not your classic rock bar that you can hear anywhere in the valley. Music is typically harder and better. Also, the food and drinks are way cheaper than most bars.\n\nWhat's best about O'Kelley's is the waitress, Meghan! She is very nice, funny and provided great service."
5,Wow i dont think that i could ever say how good this was! i mean it was so good my family keeps talking about it. not only was the service good every one was so nice and knew alot about what we wanted and told us everything that we needed to know!  its well worth the money! any time i am in vegas i will be here for sure!
5,"This is a great, no... Awesome Japanese restaurant!!!! I love the tofu, never tried a tofu so fresh before. The sushi is also very very good! I recommend for everyone that wants a authentic Japanese experience."
5,Amazing experience!! My wife and I had the best couples massage. We are staying at the  Pallazo and decided to go there first for our day at the spa. When my wife and I went to see about using their services the staff was very rude and the lady at the desk even rolled her eyes at my wife. We turned around looked up Best couples massage on Yelp and saw the Bellagio reviews were fantastic. The staff was amazing and the services were outstanding. I would highly recommend this to all my friends and family.
5,"I've been traveling to Edinburgh frequently and Cafe Keno is a stop I make every trip.  It's central on the Royal Mile so right in the heart of everything.  I've stopped in for a quick coffee while I'm walking around like a tourist and I've also stopped in for several hours to eat a meal and use the wifi.  Indeed, what brought me in in the first place is the great free wifi signal, but the reason I come back is the people and the food.  The owners and the staff are very friendly and engaging and will treat you like family if you engage them.  A lot of locals eat here which a great sign.  The prices are about what you'd expect for a cafe in a tourist area but the serving sizes are huge!  They advertise 3-egg omelets but I swear there are 5 eggs in there.  I particularly like the lamb koftas.  Great cafe!"
5,"Phenomenal. My wife and I ate there for brunch on Sunday. We had the shrimp tamale appetizer, which was really good. She had the swordfish club and I had the Mesa burger, both reccomended by the waitress. Both were Phenomenal! The burger got better with every bite."
5,We enjoyed our first night in Edinburgh dining at Origano. It was an all around lovely experience. For a starter my husband and I had the Bruschetta Crudo. For the main course we shared personal pizzas- my husband had the Vesuvio (spicy!) and I ordered the Caprino. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful as some of the menu ingredients were new to us. We don't have rocket in Canada. Stellar meal! The suggested wine pairing highly complemented the flavours. Highly recommended for a lovely evening out.
5,"I love this place, I'm not a regular but the few times I've came it's been great!! I only get pedicures and they are very thorough and take their time. I come on Mondays and it's never an issue getting helped right away!! This is the place to go :)"
5,"I can't believe I'm about to say this but, Poppy Seeds Bagels are FABULOUS!! They are good in every way! They Really do taste like they are from NY!! \n\nIt's a far drive from NODA but its a good thing my sister decided to move to the middle of nowhere because otherwise I would have never been able to try these never mind even hear about this place!\n\nYou walk in and they have baked deliciousness staring right at you along with all of they're homemade Cream Cheese! A lot of different flavors from Regular to Jalape\u00f1o. They seem to get really busy just while we were there on Monday morning at around 7:30 am the line began to go out the door! Stallings is very lucky I can't wait for more Poppy Seeds to open closer to me! Please?!"
5,"Soto Ayam was the best I've had.  The broth, which is typically very mild in most Sotos, was flavorful and aromatic, with a strong kick of citrus ginger from the galangal.  \n\nBeef Rendang was equally flavorful and rich, with a pleasantly spicy dollop of chili sambal on the side (could have eaten a whole bowl of it)."
5,"(I will preface this review by saying I've only been to the Ivory Room twice, and I haven't been sampling bars for very long. So. Disclaimer over.)\n\nDespite that, this place is my absolute FAVORITE. They just expanded, which means more room for dancing around--always a plus for me. If you're going to go for an all-out, crazy, fun time, go on Dueling Piano nights (Thursday-Saturday nights, I believe). There's a $5 cover charge (though if you go to Capital Tap Haus first and bring your receipt, you get in free), but it is so so worth it. It's basically one big, loud sing-along with the entire bar. Order a few $3 sweet tea vodka lemonades on a Friday or Saturday night...you WILL lose your voice from sing-screaming to the pianists, but I promise you will not regret it.\n\nI've never had any problems with staff or service, so I can't really speak to what other people have said about that. Love this place. Will definitely be going back, many times."
5,"It had been a while since I had a seat at a real barber shop, let alone the time to get my hair cut anywhere but great clips. I was frustrated, and overgrown. My once amazing beard was a disaster, and I wasn't feeling very pretty. \nYelp led me to this amazing shop, located in a groovy spot of Central Phoenix. Inside, one of the most vibrant, friendly barbers I've met welcomed me warmly, and pointed out soft drinks and pop corn available for free! The waiting area is appointed with really luxo seats. Every inch of the shop has something really fascinating to look at, and if that's not enough, a rockin' home theater system with dvd's galore is available to make the wait great. \nAs for the haircut, this is probably the best I've looked in all of 2014. Matt did a great job shaving my head, and added a great element of style to my once again amazing beard!!!!"
5,"I ate at La Scala this past New Year's Eve 2011. I had an excellent dining experience. The cuisine prepared this restaurant is the best Italian food I've tasted outside of Italy! The seafood dishes I tried tasted fresh, as if it were straight from the Mediterranean. Our server, Brian, was attentive and thoughtful. The small space and dim lighting provided an intimate setting. Combined with the live Sinatra-style singer and pianist, it made for a romantic setting suitable for a meaningful date or event. The price of the food was affordable; the most expensive plate was about $30. Based on taste alone, it seemed like we should be paying twice the amount we paid. I'll be back to La Scala again the next time I'm in Vegas!"
5,"Today, I woke up ill. Very ill. I felt as though nothing except perhaps a new body might make me feel better. Berocca and Beechams were not doing the trick. And I had a killer craving for hob nobs. I was at my wit's end.\n\nEnter the ever wonderful Louise C with a special delivery. Vitamin tablets, my requested hob nobs and what's that? A little brown paper bag with the \""Peter's Yard\"" stamp?! I knew I couldn't stomach anything rich or heavy...and lo she produced the most wonderful thing I think I've ever seen.\n\nTwo pear, blueberry and sour cream scones. Heavens above. In my hour of need, Peter's Yard (by the good hand of Louise C) were there. A wee cup of tea, a thin spread of butter, and the freshest, most loveliest, fruitiest, moist scone and I felt just that little bit better.\n\nRead my other previous reviews (below) on Peter's Yard for a good idea of all the other (delicious) reasons I love them. But today, I love them just for that scone -nothing more, nothing less."
5,"Heaven on earth. Dinner is standard hipster-fare and a little less spicy than I'd like it, but basically very good; the cheesecakes are next-level brilliant. Drinks are reasonably-priced, maybe a tiny bit more than I'd like, but I'm a cheapskate. Huge selection of scotches and bourbons, and a lot of cocktails made with cider, all of which are worth trying (they mull the cider but keep it carbonated--awesome!). Great d\u00e9cor. The best place to bring out-of-town friends to impress them, especially when it's surrounded on all sides by the great historic Montr\u00e9al row houses. Same bartenders a lot of the time, and one did a shot of Jameson with me, on-the-house, on my birthday after accurately guessing that it was my favourite liquor."
5,"Oh how I love this place. Lobster quesadilla, pollo poblano, mole, fresh table side guac with special treats like cranberries or pomegraite thrown in. Cool art, friendly staff and the best damn sangria in town!"
5,"Gotta love CM. Employees are always chill and awesome, their beer selection is tops (come with some cash to spend, microbrews are not cheap), and the deli kicks booty for both meaters and non-meaters alike. I have to admit a current addiction to the chickpea-batter fried cashews-- its like a cashew falafel, SO good."
5,"Just had a great experience with the Green Cab!  Although the person who took my call said it could take up to an hour for  a driver to arrive, it only took about 15 minutes!  The driver did say that he just happened to be in the area, but I was happy.  I just moved here from NYC, and I can say that it in comparison it was a very pleasant, clean, high tech ride.  \n\nAs a bonus, the price was awesome, and the company accepts credit cards!"
5,"Beautiful location on the mountain. Beautiful rooms. Probably our family second favorite to the Hilton Squaw Peak. Perfect for an in-town getaway. The pool is huge -- actually called a Water Village -- and tons of fun for kids and grown-ups alike. And, durring the summer, you can stay for around 100 bucks!"
5,"Great and honest service, after wrestling with two dealers to replace my flat tire I came into discount tire and Mike Weston helped to get back on the road. \nHe was able to talk to the insurance company with the dealer to make things happen. \nThe guys at the dealer would just tell me to call this number and then go to website before they could do anything and make about 21 excuses why they could not do it. Anyway I will definitely recommend discount tire and will come back in the future when I am need."
5,"This is my first dog so I have to give the disclaimer that I have no experience to compare to -- but this place is awesome. Never have to wait too long, scheduling an appointment is easy, and the staff is all very friendly. At my first appointment, I was afraid of looking like a total newb but Dr. K reassured me that I was doing this dog ownership thing right and gave me some great pointers. Since then, he's been awesome with our pup and very informative when we go in. Glad our first experience has been a good one!"
5,"amazing hotel!!! My new place to stay when I go to Vegas. Fantastic rooms! Its all about the one bedroom suite with the japanese soak tub! Amazingly friendly and helpful staff and fantastic food! Only place I gambled in the whole time. Don't miss out on the chandelier bar, great drinks, incredible atmosphere and a great place to have a date."
5,"Great coffee, great service, great atmosphere, and even better prices. I'm so glad to have found this coffee shop near UNLV. Way better than Starbucks and the prices beat both Starbucks and the Coffee Bean. I'll definitely be back!"
5,"This location is a bit smaller than the West Side store but just as clean and offering the same variety of sweets. The ladies who work the counter are always in the best of moods and on this visit even remembered my usual order.  I was exceptionally famished as I was post hike and really needed to fill my tank so I tore right into that red chili burrito right there in the parking lot. If you want fresh off the belt (hot to the touch) tortillas, you'll have to go to the WS location. Bring your own butter!\n\nNo Cards- Cash Only"
5,"I have severe degenerative arthritis in my hands.  After finding out that OSR has a hand specialist on staff I made an appointment.. What a difference a professional caring therapist makes.  I am pain free for the first time in years and follow the methods taught to keep that way.  I have recommended several friends and family members, something I rarely do.  Keep up the good work OSR - how wonderful."
5,"For Chinese takeaways Hong's is one of the best I've ever had.  It's fast, it's delicious and it's not too greasy. I love Hong's. I'd recommended: the shredded crispy chicken in chilli sauce, the satay chicken, the chicken wings (salt and pepper), ribs, the pad pad thai. Not only do they serve Chinese food but they also do Thai.  Hong's is also super affordable. Get a bunch of friends together and order a various things off the menu.  I guarantee Hong's won't disappoint!"
5,"I'm officially in love with this bar. Drinks are so cheap, it's mind-boggling. I actually had to get package booze to-go so I could use my credit card to make the $10 minimum! \n\nYou can order food from Little Chicago Pizza - which is in the same strip mall - and they'll deliver it to you at the Roadrunner. \n\nIt's super-dark, nicely air-conditioned, with pool table, darts, juke box, and the requisite sports on tv. The bartender was fantastic, and the patrons were friendly. I recommend riding your bike or taking a taxi - the drinks are seriously that cheap."
5,Let me start off by saying that I absolutely love Jamba Juice! They're always fresh and delicious there a\u00e7ai berry bowl is my absolute favorite! Miss Veronica is my favorite person there! She is always so helpful and friendly :) she knows my order now LOL. I put in my phone number and get points for rewards so that's always nice :-) sometimes they do take a long time but it's always worth it I guess despite the fact that sometimes I get my order wrong I will always be coming back here.
5,"First timer there and I FELL IN LOVE! I love their desserts. The Green Tea Cake, Strawberry Shortcake, and Tiramisu was so delicious that my son and I finished it within minutes from getting home. Tiramisu is my favorite and not a lot of people make it the way I think it should be, but Suzuya's one was soooooo good. Will be going back again today and everyday after that."
5,"Best tacos in Phoenix! No other taco place in Phoenix comes even close to the great tacos they serve here. The wait is long but well worth it. If you want the best tacos, then this is the spot."
5,"Finally got back here again.  Menu has changed some since last time.  I ordered too much.  I put an order in for a bowl of chicken noodle soup and the fish amok.  I was starting to get hungry so in the meantime I ordered a mango drink.  It was more like a dessert.  It was like a mango soda.  Very delish.  After drinking about half of it my soup arrived.  It was even better than what I had expected.\nNow with this mango drink and really trying to finish up the soup I was feeling quite full.  I asked the waiter to pack up the fist to go.\nI had the fish the next day and I am hooked!!!!!!  The first 2 bites I wasn't quite sure as it tasted quite different but after the 3rd, that was it for me.\nI have to get back there sooner next time and not wait for another year."
5,"My husband's Shih Tzu, Hunter, was in dire need of a grooming appointment. His last two grooming appointments at our previous home in Santa Cruz, Ca. were dismal failure. He just was not as styling as he could be!! My daughter recommended Scooby-Do's which is where she takes her Pug, Daisy and Shih Tzu, Rhyse. So off we go on Saturday morning with Hunter to his \""spa\"" appointment as we call it!! Scooby-Do's did a excellent job at finding out how we wanted Hunter cut and what exactly their services included. The price was excellent and when we picked Hunter up he looked like the King he is , minus his Shih Tzu eyelashes..:-( that's okay they'll grow out!!"
5,"History is important especially for the things that Pittsburg has gone through. This is by far the best place in PA for a good lesson on the local history and culture. At least once a year every citizen of the state should take this tour and learn where everything came from. \n\nThis is for anyone who enjoys nature, learning, and day away from the television. We believe in a certain way of life and this tour is filled stories and insights that make that life very special. \n\nThe guide was very happy to answer all my questions and it was interesting to see how steel was made. it was so nice to meet all the new curious people on the tour as well."
5,"I've been passing this place for years and finally decided to stop. I usually end up getting the Wolf Pack Special (Wineburnger and Coors Lite) not that I've been there multiple times.\n\nIt's a great dive bar, nothing fancy, just good service and good food! The ghost pepper cheese wine burger is awesome! Last time in I has the Super (two patties) which was more than enough to hold me over until lunch the next day.\n\nDespite the construction it's well worth making the trip to check out the Phoenix staple with memorabilia adorned walls and a great atmosphere for watching some sports."
5,The best service you going to get in the Queen City .. The staff is great and they answer your question
5,This review is for Oscar behind the bar.  He is simply the best and hardest working bartender I have ever seen and believe me I've been in plenty of bars.
5,"A friend bought me lunch here this last Saturday.  He's been telling me about this place for months, and coincidentally, I heard about this place from a former co-worker as well.  He insisted I try several dishes, so we split the first two plates.  We got a combination sandwich, which tasted incredible.  I'm not much of a sandwich fan, but the fusion of flavor was just right.  The next plate was the Cm B\u00f2 Nng, the beef was soooo tender and flavorful, that I am still craving it 2 days later.  Then we each got a bowl of pho that was the best I have tasted here in Arizona (had some incredible tasting pho in California).  I was so stuffed that I couldn't finish it.  I would definitely like to come here again.  Staff was very courteous and friendly."
5,The best park in the community! Well taken care of by the HOA. Plenty if space to have fun and see other families enjoying themselves as well. Such comfy grass. The hike up the peak is not bad. Plenty of dog stations for people to pick up their dogs crap. The only bad thing is the bats that fly around at night during the movies at the park!
5,"Nom Nom Nom.  Love this place! Located near the south park mall - parking isn't too bad because of that.  Been here more times than I can count.  They gave me coupons one of the first times I went and have been back ever since to use them.  They care about what the consumers think, as the manager is always walking around asking how things are. It can get busy quick, so I've had to sit at the bar a few times, because there was no wait. The Avocado Tini is my fav. I must get it every time! The music that plays in the bathroom is interesting, I asked the server about the story behind it - I don't remember off hand, but a interesting one."
5,"Excellent restaurant.  I went there for a work lunch and had the mango salad with chef's secret recipe dressing and garlic shrimp.  It was excellent, especially the dressing.  I took my family there two days later and everything we ordered was delicious.  My wife, who is very critical, loved the clay pot with seafood and tofu.  We decided to celebrate my mother-in-law's birthday there a week later. We had 12 people and we enjoyed everything we ordered except for the steamed chicken with rice.  Their menu has 151 different items.  Trust me, the food is excellent.  We met Wendy and had a friendly conversation with her.  She's like a loving grandmother at the restaurant."
5,"When I think of a good Sunday breakfast or brunch I always start craving French cuisine. We have eaten here a few times and every single time we dine I am blown away by the flavors that dance on my tastebuds. My favorite dish is the salmon and brioche, it is a buttery and beautiful creation that takes me straight to France.  Such a great place!!"
5,"I own a home that Dane has rented for me. He is soooo nice and his staff is super accomodating. The last review is bogus!  I've used Dane for a while here and have had nothing but great follow up, detailed voice mails, constant email updates, and calls at work if needed. I think I can say he always responds to me same day, and always personally. It really doesn't get much better than having someone like Dane.\n\n-Tory"
5,"Brand new restaurant (6 weeks they said)... Found it on Yelp because my cousin's gf wanted Asian for her bday dinner. \n\nHands down, best birthday dinner I've ever been to.\n\nThere were 6 of us in the group, and we decided to do everything family style. We ordered 5 appetizers and 4 entrees. The place was about 3/4 full, but our waters were always refilled by the time they hit half full. The food all came out hot, and in a perfect progression just as we were finishing up what had been brought out first. \n\nEverything was delicious, and I'll definitely be bringing other friends here when they come to town."
5,"Soul food that make your heart smile. \n\nEvery time i visit da south for work I get excited about new bbq and soul food spots that I get to try. This place alone made my trip worth while. \n\nHad the jumbo wings with mac and cheese, collard greens, and cornbread.Everything was delicious and had a unique touch. The collard greens were the best I've ever had.\n\nThe selection and customer service here was outstanding. They even have a phone app, how cool right ?\n\nCan't wait to come back and get me some more Mert's."
5,"We have gone with Snail Motorsports for so many things, since Juan started in his garage, doing small jobs.  He has powder coated an antique medicine cabinet, several sets of wheels, several parts for my Jeep, media blasted a ton of our chairs for our business...that ton equals out to around 300.  When he tells you when he will have your items ready, he is right there with it when he promises.  You can find him in his shop way into the late hours...just to get your item completed.  You will never find anyone more Type A about his finished product than Juan.  We have never been disappointed in any item or any quote we have received.  He does all of his own media blasting and powder coating...he doesn't farm them out to other contractors.  He service is top notch and I would recommend Snail Motorsports to everyone.  Thank you Juan and the Snail Motorsports team."
5,"I was a walk in customer at david and friends, luckily Rylee was available :) she was awesome and loved the way she did my hair! I recommend you to go see her if you're thinking about going. On their website there is also a discount 25% off services :) definitely going back to see Rylee."
5,"The best Hamburger I have ever had, right here! I go and do take out and bring it to my hotel pool it is so good.\n\nBlue cheese, carmelized oninions, the Best!\n\nI had dinner there as well and found it really good too, I just crave that hamburger whenever I go to Las Vegas and have to have it. My friend and his wife turned me on to this place and I have been indebted to them since. \n\nGo there for lunch and have one you wont be disappointed."
5,This is my anniversary spot.\n\nAmazing atmosphere with the finest foods and beverage!\n\nI recommend grabbing a rooftop table on a beautiful night. \n\nThis is a high roller type of place with class and will not disappoint.\n\nShine your shoes and give it a shot!
5,Best Philly in Las Vegas I've ever had! Sad that geris closed on trop but once I discovered this place it's no question and a lot better. They use fresh and expensive meat the rolls are a lot better than great buns and amorosos. You can tell easily. It makes Pops on Decatur and what you get at the San gennaro feast taste like garbage. This is the real deal the owners are very cool from Philly and taught me what a real Philly is.dont waste your money at the canival ever again go to Hanks!
5,"Freestone park weather is almost here!\n\nPry their cold dead hands off that video game console and get them outside for some fun!\n\nFrom the train, to the ducks, fishing, the clean picnic area's or the batting cages and carousal there is something to do.\n\nBeen here with my family and nieces and just in general while going to gilbert schools, always a nice experience !\n\n\nThe nice weather is almost here!"
5,"I do not know why this place has such a low rating. I love this place, the food is great the portions are more than generous, they use white meat chicken, and the service is attentive. Also, the prices are very cheap, $5.50 and $6.50 for lunch is perfectly acceptable. They will change the heat level for any dish and make special arrangements for you. I wanted honey walnut shrimp with chicken instead of shrimp and they did not bat an eyelash they just said no problem. I also like that the plain lo-mein is truly plain, no vegetables or anything. Really give this place a try, and for other posters who have not been here in a while, you may reconsider coming back to this place. The decor is a little odd, 50's Chinese diner chic? Kind of strange but who cares? The place is good, clean, cheap, and the service is good. What more could you want?"
5,"I go there a few times a month and i never get tired if it. Great food, friendly staff, low prices for quality foods."
5,"My daughter's school recently had a fundraiser here.  For the amount of people they had and the line nearly out the door, they did a great job of keeping it moving!  \n\nI love Chipotle.  The burrito bowl is filling and delicious!  It's a great idea.  I always find I feel over stuffed with a regular burrito but the bowl is perfect.  Their chips are fresh and their guacamole is delicious!  It has just the right amount of zip for me.  The kids meal is a good deal.  My daughter gets her favorite cheese quesadilla and rice and beans along with a drink.  \n\nThis location is clean and friendly.  No matter if the line is long or short, they do a great job with good service and good food."
5,"The food is GREAT!!!\n\nI've just moved to LV , and I try to find good food is this town .. and this is one of them.\n\nIt was worth the drive from Summerlin to them. Whole in the wall .. ARE THE BEST!!\n\nI've had the beef, fish and chicken tacos ...\n\nThe beef and fish were to die for, the \""fusion\"" for the beef taco was a great new taste for me, the fish was also great, but the chicken .. for my taste was not so great ...Maybe because I had first the beef and fish taco's?? Maybe .."
5,"Planet Hollywood gets a 5 star rating for numerous reasons. And here is my Top 10 List on why PH is the coolest hotel around\n\n1) It's a Starwood Hotel - meaning I can use points to redeem a free room\n2) It's much more prettier than the Aladdin - it's pretty swanky\n3) The rooms are decked out with tv/movie pictures and memorabilia - ours was Days of our Lives (which was perfect since my best friend - the bachelorette loves that show)\n4) The room is clean, the beds are comfortable and the bathroom can fit 4 girls trying to get ready to hit hte club\n5) There is no limit on room service - meaning you can order it all day long. Our laziness got us room service not just once but three times in one day (and that means 3 different room service tables)\n6) The staff is nice if you have questions - the concierge helped us to try to find $10 steak & lobster\n7) You feel like a celebrity walking through here\n8) It has the Miracle Mile shops - if you like your shopping\n9) Free bottles of water in the room - thank you PH, no hangover or dehydration\n10) Reasonable priced rooms! Booyah!!\n\nCheers!"
5,"Fantastic buffet, definitely one of my favorites around, rivaling Aria's or Bellagio's...all food is cooked well, depending when you get to it determines whether you're getting the fresh batch or not. Fried chicken especially stood out to me (no, not just because of that reason!). It had a maple batter which made it taste like delectable chicken and waffles. Ahhh the good times."
5,"Thanks Neny! Very calming and relaxing atmosphere. I can't believe I have had 4 massages in 4 months, definitely a first for me.  I was hesitant to buy into the membership, but very glad I did. I am glad to be going on a regular basis. It has made all the difference in the world. Since I work on a computer all day, I found that this is important to be able to prevent the stiffness and discomfort that occurs over time. My neck and shoulder feel so much better. After 4 treatments my sciatica symptoms have disappeared. \nI would recommend this Elements location to everyone. Best thing I have done for myself."
5,"Love this place! If you have not tried this out yet definitely do so! Perfect for the hot AZ summers.\n\nI have tried the Mango with Chile, Roasted Pecan, Strawberry Cream, Orange Cream, and the Watermelon with Mint. All were fantastic. My favorite flavor really is the one that I am eating at the moment. They are all that good. \n\nBTW if you decide to sit down and eat your popsicles in the store, their water cooler is always filled with different fruit flavors! The last time I was there it was strawberry and orange flavored water. Genius!"
5,"Our favorite yogurt spot by far!  The staff is friendly, yogurt selections are great, toppings are plentiful, and you gotta love the awesome pink and green spoons! \nLastly, no sample nazis here...unlike some other yogurt places ;)"
5,"Carrot Top elicits such a negative knee jerk reaction from so many.  It's like asking people at a pizza joint if they want anchovies.  When was the last time you actually had anchovies??  The guy has been a Vegas headliner since 2005.  There's got to be a reason why he's been able to stick it out on the strip and fill seats in that theater for the long haul while so many headline comedians have come and gone.  One year they're at the Excalibur, then The Plaza and then there's their one way ticket to Laughlin. \n\nI didn't think I would enjoy the show as much as I did.  He opened the show at a frenetic pace going from prop joke to prop joke.  Didn't think the joke was funny?  No problem!  There's another one in 5 seconds.  It was like watching the biggest 5 year old wise ass with A.D.D. show off his box of toys.  Freakin hilarious!!  The rest of the show was just as great.  You'll definitely laugh a lot and have a fun time unless you don't laugh at cock jokes.  So yeah....eunuchs may be sensitive to Carrot Top. \n\nWe sat in the second to last row.  There's not a bad seat in the house.  You can purchase the cheapest seats without hesitation if you're still skeptical."
5,"Great service, great drinks and their custom glasses are awesome.  I personally recommend getting a Zombie in a Bearded Clam glass."
5,"Love this restaurant!\n\nI avoid all chain because they are so noisy and music playing like your at a club. Sometimes, I feel like stuffing a roll in the persons mouth next to me because they wont shut up on their cells. Afterwards, I feel like I need a padded room to recuperate.\n\nEverything at Pho Nhat is wonderful. Great tasting food. Pleasant service. Quiet unless the TV is on or an occasionally loud person.\n\nVisit this place...not fancy inside but the food is amazing!"
5,If you at all a Frank Lloyd Wright fan you must take the time to visit Taliesin West. The place is beautiful and the 60 minute tour we took was just right. There are longer tours also available.
5,"We will be checking into The Orleans on the 15th of this month and this will be our 4th trip to The Orleans. We love it here and always regret staying anywhere else. The hotel is clean, the staff are always very helpful, and you get lots of free drinks when your gambling. \nNow I've never been comped a meal or a room stay so Im not sure how that other poster got all that, but it's a great place to stay if you don't like all the hustle and bustle of the strip, but still want to have fun. \nWe come here every year for the Vegas to Reno races and we'll always be coming back!!"
5,"Sushi Samba is my absolute favorite place for happy hour while in Vegas!\n\nThree words to describe this place: chic, sexy, sushi. From their delicious and creative sushi rolls to their amazing drinks, I always enjoy myself here...and no matter what part of the strip I am at, I make sure I get to the Palazzo and get my Sushi Samba fix.\n\nMy favorites here are the Berkshire Pork Belly with butterscotch miso, a Caipirinha, and the eel and avocado rolls.\n\nThe service has always been great and the bartenders are friendly and informative. I love the concept of Latin and Asian cuisines colliding (i.e. Chifa in Philly) and I think they execute it perfectly.\n\nAfter a long, hot day at the pool parties, Sushi Samba is my go-to spot."
5,"Since writing the original review, We went back to Le Grande (we always do) and tried the Roasted corn pizza, the Smoked Salmon Salad, and ended with a huge red velvet cupcake.  The roasted corn pizza with the goat cheese and fresh basil ... to die for!  The smoked salmon salad was good, fresh, nothing to complain about.. .  The cupcake was huge and good for 2 adults and a toddler.  Yum!  \n\nNext stop.. their new restaurant across the street called Ingos Tasty Food.  Headed there now and will review shortly!"
5,"My two youngest kids are fascinated with the Titanic. They love the movie, watch history shows on the famous ship and even build models made of Legos. We decided to take the tour of the Titanic exhibit while on vacation in Vegas. We purchased the self walking tour and did not get the headphones.\nOne word- WOW! It was really amazing. The exhibit moved seamlessly through each phase of the tour. From the lighted, bright area with background info on the Titanic creator to the dark starry filled sky when the ship sank in the dark ocean water. It truly immersed you in the experience. They even had a large iceberg you could touch along with a replica of the starboard ship walkway where you could envision yourself looking out over the midnight water.\nThe real icing on the cake, was the Big Piece. It was a huge multi-ton piece of the original Titanic ship. It was so amazing and awe inspiring. We literally spent almost an hour in there just looking at it and studying its sheer size.\nOnce your tour concludes, you can compare your postcard, given at the beginning of the tour, to the list of those who were saved and those who periled. Its interesting to see if you survived or not.\nThis is a truly one of a kind place and deserve to be at the top of your Vegas trip."
5,"WOW ..... I have to agree with Rachel C. on this one.They have really cool  flavors and its HOMEMADE !\nAfter listening to Marty Griffin ( KDKA) talk about Antinitys for a few days on his morning show,\nI decided to try it out. After all , who doesn't like Ice Cream.\nWell , I'm impressed. I got the Chocolate shake a few nights ago , and last night,\na Bowl of Vanilla Bean. GREAT Homemade flavor. No plastic added !\nI have the Toasted Coconut on my list for this weekend.\nThis is why I love Pittsburgh and the small business flavor here !"
5,"I have been going to Dr. Kang for a number of years now. Not only has Dr. Kang been extremely nice/helpful, his staff is always there to greet me with a smile.  Whether I am going in for a routine cleaning or something a bit more intensive, I have never had a bad experience.  And, getting to choose what movie or TV show you would like to watch while Dr. Kang and his staff are working on you is an added bonus. I have recommended many friends and co-workers to Dr. Kang and will gladly continue to do so."
5,"Watching the barbers at work here is pure joy. It is so important when someone puts so much time, care and effort into their craft. Cody cut my boyfriends hair in a classic gentleman's cut and it is perfect! You can tell that he really truly cares about his art and his customer. We will certainly be coming back. Also, as a side note, this place is so good that even the Marines trust these guys to perfect their coif. A must visit barber, for sure!"
5,"By far one of my favorite hotels and casinos!!!\n\nSeriously as good as it gets.  About six months ago I had some friends in town and we stayed here.  The rooms are beautiful as can be.  Everything is remote operated, which made for some laughs trying to get the curtains closed and the lights off at bedtime.  \n\nThe place is clean and beautiful and I love the decor.  Very classy, very Asian inspired without being overwhelming.  They have a beautiful water fountain wall near the Valet that is worth seeing, even if you don't valet a car.  \n\nI love everything about this place!"
5,"My husband and I love coming here! We would go during the week, but it is out of the way unfortunately. So, we choose to come on the weekends, and we love it!\n\nThe service is always very friendly. We sit at the bar most of the time, but they have couches, chairs, booths, and tables to sit at. There is also an area for kids to play in, which is very awesome for the parents that visit here. Their WiFi is free, so its a great place to work if you dont work in an office. There is also close bicycle parking, we actually just leave ours on the sidewalk since it is a safe area. The people that frequent this place are always nice, and I often see groups meeting here. \n\nWe have only had their breakfast burrito, and it was pretty good. Going to try other food next time. It looks like they have a bigger lunch menu than breakfast, but like I said, I have only tried the one thing. \n\nOverall a great coffee shop, we will be back this weekend!"
5,"My gosh! \nThis place actually looks like a hole in the wall from the street...but once you walk in...it is quite quaint! Went there for brunch...the coffee and tea is self serve, and the waitress who served us was funny and very nice. Had the half and half...would for sure go for that again! Challah bread with strawberry shortcake 'stuffing' and a poached egg with bacon on bread with the most amazing sauce...with fruit and potatoes!\nAlso they had board games! Played trivial pursuit with my family while waiting for our food.\nLoved this place!!!!!"
5,"I  worked with Africans in KC and ate a lot of their great food.  This is the best.  I LOVED it.  Tastey and worth the trip from Ahwatukee.  Seriously, if you want great taste go for it.  It doesn't get any better from Africa."
5,Very nice and thorough!  Previous owners of the house had two different locks on the front door and the garage so one of the locks had to be replaced.    The technician totally understood that we were on a budget and didn't try and scam me into buying a bunch of needless or expensive parts.  He was very prompt and professional.  Very happy with the service we received.
5,"I love this AAA office.  Today I stopped by 6 minutes after they closed, and they unlocked the door (with a smile) to let me in so that I could get my AAA guidebooks.  \n\nMy insurance representative is Wendy Everson and she is very knowledgable, friendly, and responsive.  She answers all my emails or phone calls promptly.  I would highly recommend her."
5,"If this place were crack cocaine*, I'd snort it.  In short, magical happiness in the form of a Mexican/Cuban restaurant in downtown Vegas.  Believe it.  \n\n*Also, crack is whack. See:  http://extremecatholic.blogspot.com/images/whitney.jpg"
5,"My pregnant coworker brought me to this place for happy hour. Reminds me of LA Sushi joints. Scented warm towels when you arrive. Free* Miso Soup, salad, and edamame.... Then half off sushi rolls! Yes please. Service was attentive, but casual. The guys rolling the rolls at the sushi bar were super interactive, and seemed really happy to just be alive. They made the energy of the place really positive. My friend and I ordered 5 sushi rolls... and some nice hot green tea. Each of our bill, out the door with a (hefty) tip included?... $15.00! \n\nWay better than corporate, chain, run by all white americans sushi joints (cough RA Sushi)....\n\n\nGo try it!"
5,"Yeehaw. I needed me some boots (or so I thought).\n\nI went to Boot Barn with the intention of seeing if they had a certain pair of boots I had seen online and they did - plus so much more! The amount of boots and styles they have here (particularly the ladies section) is stellar! I had been looking online at boots and thinking I may wear a pair under my wedding dress. I thought maybe I could pull of a little country flair, after all... in reality, no one would actually see the boots unless I purposefully showed them!\n\nWell I went here with the intention of just looking and I fell in shopping love with a pair of boots. They are all easily marked and you can try them on by just pulling them off the shelves. I ended up buying a pair of really lovely boots. However, I had second, third, fourth thoughts about them the next day. Being the fickle bride-to-be I am, I actually ended up returning the boots.\n\nThroughout the whole process the staff was very nice and understanding of why I was returning the boots. The return on my card has already been processed!\n\nI will return here someday and buy some nice boots, I swear! I can't keep wearing my Mom's old vintage ones for too much longer."
5,"Dr. Bennett  got me through my pregnancy when rib and low back pain became debilitating. She's Webster certified - something any mom to be needs to demand in a chiropractor - so she knows how to handle the changing and growing pregnant body. She even has comfy pillows that allow you to lie on your belly - something you really come to miss!  \n\nI've continued to go to her for weekly adjustments since the birth of my son. She always listens carefully to my whining and knows just the right adjustment to use to help me. She has even helped me with my TMJ and wrist problems. \n\nI am a chiropractic junkie, and have tried many others in the valley since moving here five years ago. Dr. Bennett is the only one to earn my trust and continually meet my needs. She will be my chiropractor for as long as we live in Phoenix!"
5,"This is the place to go if your looking for an outstanding cup of gourmet coffee. The staff is seriously knowledgable about the entire process and will gladly give you an information overload if you ask, even if they do so with a hipster poise (it doesn't really bother me when they have some useful nuggets of knowledge to back up their hipness).\n\nLocal artists regularly grace the walls with their artwork and you will always find a variety of artists, designers, developers, and general hip folk typing away on their respective mac book pros.\n\nHaters gonna hate, but I love this place. Truly original."
5,"Ordered the breakfast special for the day- a Tex-Mex skillet with chorizo ($7.99, add $.99 for chorizo).  The chorizo was freshly made in-house, and tasted delicious.  Having made chorizo from scratch myself, I appreciate the effort and the right combination of spices it takes to make a good batch.  It was the perfect mix of spices and saltiness.  The skillet came with a hearty portion of potatoes, veggies, sour cream, and cheese, and looked excellent presentation-wise.  Service was excellent like last time, and the young gentleman here (Maybe the manager or the owner?) stopped us as we were leaving to thank me personally for my Yelp review.  Upgrade one star!"
5,"Ok I am poor...and Lifetime is the reason for it.  But you know what...I don't care...I heart LIfetime Fitness.  It is the only gym that I actually feel comfortable working out in.  They never tried to upsell me on packages.  My sales manager (who works in Scottsdale) is the best.  But on top of everything else...I love my trainer.  (this is why I am poor...but I love him so)  He is the best and believe me...when the manager was choosing a trainer for me...they knew what they were doing.   Matt is the best.  He is so worth it.\n\nI am going to have my first experience with the classes tomorrow, and I have signed up for volleyball. (hint hint...they need more players)  \n\nThe lifespa is awesome, and the Life Cafe has the best Chicken Pesto sandwich in the world.  Everybody is so friendly there...and the whole gym is extremely clean...another thing that I like.  I cannot complain in the least."
5,"Loved this place.  I had the pulled pork sandwich, piled very high plus sweet potato casserole which was awesome and banana pudding. Yum! Husband had Mahi Mahi sandwich which he said unbelievable.  Lima beans good too.  Plus easy casual atmosphere. We'll be back."
5,"Want an A/C or heating repair done right? Multiple options presented to you if you need a new unit?  Then I highly recommend CHA.  \n\nA couple years ago we had a broken unit, another company came in (after making us wait), did not fix the problem and were surly on top of it.  Then we called Cruz at CHA. He was VERY fast to respond, and was able to get us going again. It was so nice to work with someone who was professional and personable. And his prices were competitive, easily beating out the competition.\n\nIn addition, when an old air conditioning unit needed replacing, Cruz provided several options, different models, prices, and explained in terms we could understand the differences between the units, energy performance, warranties, etc.  It made making our decision about which unit to select so much easier.  And again, everything happened fast.  Price check? His quote easily beat anyone else's.\n\nHe does duct replacement, and unit maintenance as well.  \n\nCHA is saved in my phone, and it will be the first call I make if I have any A/C or heating unit issues in the future."
5,"Coming from Japan, I can attest to the authenticity of the ramen served here.  The flavor of the soup was so rich and delicious, it was truly a treat to get to eat here.  Probably one of the best ramen I've ever ate!"
5,"This is our favorite Fudds, we almost stop by here before leaving town. The girl working the register, I can't recall her name (very pretty, lots of tattoos) is always very friendly and is a pleasure to talk with. Burgers are always great here."
5,"Heading home from Vegas to San Diego and this was a random pick for breakfast as we wanted to avoid fast food. \n\nExcellent food, fast service and VERY reasonable prices. \n\nCool atmosphere and worth the couple minute drive off the freeway. Even though this is an executive airport there is easy parking by the entrance and open to the public."
5,"Good crab legs.all you can eat on Monday,with a free glass of wine if you stay at hooters.mashed potatoes and salad was also on point."
5,"I always wondered how other major Yogurt chains would compete against the likes of Yogurtland.  Yogurtology is actually quite good.  The first main difference when I entered the door is that the place had a very scientific look and feel.  As we all know, something ending with \""-ology\"" is the study of.  This place definitely studied their yogurt well.  The flavors had an extra vibrant flavors.  They had very unique toppings such as boba and baklava.  I enjoyed that the workers gave samples, which makes sure that each of the stations are very sanitary.  I came here with a Groupon, and I will definitely repeat my visit."
5,I have been to many great restaurants and this meal ranked in the top 20 of all-time. We had the tasting menu and I highly recommend it. Great restaurant with a fantastic view1
5,"Hands down, me and my fiance's favorite Mexican restaurant! This is the first time I've ever reviewed a restaurant online, but I felt I had to spread the word. We've brought several friends here and when they ask us what to order we tell them anything on the menu because it's all so good. We have tried several different dishes and have never been disappointed. My personal favorite is the Tequila Sunrise Enchiladas del Mar...the creamy chipotle sauce is amazing! They have daily specials for under $10 and those are always good. Chips, refried bean dip, and salsa are complimentary. The bean dip is especially delicious, we always have to order refills. This restaurant is a must try!"
5,"I'm from Chicago and a friend recommended this place. In a word WOW. \n\nWe made reservations so had no problem being seated. Christine our waitress was incredibly attentive, and knowledgeable and suggested items due to my food allergies. \n\nI loved all the memorabilia, felt like I was back home the minute I walked through the door. \n\nBoth my friend and I had steaks. We agreed it was probably the best steak we've had in a long time. Cooked to perfection everything from beginning to end was delicious. Portions are large and I could not finish my meal. \n\nI will definitely be back next time I'm in Scottsdale."
5,"It has a friendly atmosphere and affordable. They have knowledgeable experts. They would never overcharge for their service, and they also have discounts for students. You can make an appointment or walk in. The line gets a little long sometimes, but people don't mind the wait because they are that good."
5,Very good service excellent Steak cooked perfect to My liking the asparagus was delicious.  My Son really enjoyed His Hawaiian Pizza abd of course the. Cheesecake was incredible!!!!
5,"I am SO excited to have this new Michael's so close to home!!!  I'm an avid baker and love crafts so I visit Michael's almost on a weekly basis.  I really like this store!  They have a good selection and the sales people are extremely helpful and friendly.  Even during the very busy Christmas season, the sales associated greeted everyone with a smile and were happy to help in any way they could.  They would even use their phones to scan online coupons since my Windows phone won't bring them up properly.  That's going above and beyond!\n\nI have shopped at every Michael's store within a 50 mile radius of Waxhaw and it's the service that sets this store apart from the rest.  Because of that, I give this store 5 stars because, for me, it's \""as good as it gets\"" for Michael's."
5,"always a great place to visit for breakfast :-D\nI highly recommend ranch potatoes! small, bite-size, seasoned potatoes are sooooo good! \n\nI also love their banana nut bread. it comes with a lot of the entrees and it's so moist and delicious! \n\nthey have a similar service style like bumba gump (where if u needed assistance, u would turn your sign to \""stop forest, stop!\""). they have a happy egg face and sad egg face if u need service"
5,"I've been going to Tea Infusions since literally the day before the opened. They happened to have the door open and my boyfriend and I wandered in because we were all excited. Unfortunately, we had to come back the next day:)\n\nI love tea and I love their selection. Genmaicha, Blueberry White, Monks Blend, and Moroccan Mint Green Tea are my favorites. I'm really impressed with their Moroccan Mint as it tasted like the tea I actually had in Morocco. I can't say that for the versions most other stores and brands sell. They also get all kinds of interesting seasonal flavors in.\n\nChrissy(owner), Steve, Tina and the rest of the staff have always been very friendly with me. Always willing to honor my weird requests like layering my whip cream into my blueberry pomegranate tea smoothie.\n\nI love all the little teapots and things they have for sale. Which reminds me I need to go in and get one of their cups with the infusers for work as I've already stashed up on all of their loose tea tins.\n\nIt's great too see they are now partnering with Lulu's cupcakes another yummy local independent. Now I can get my tea and cake:)"
5,"So this is the 3rd try since coming to Vegas, and Bammmm!  Finally, someone that can do a fade correctly.... I ama sooo hoppppy!\nand a pool table to boot?  Who does that?  \n\nTiff and all the gurls are cool, refreshments served..... and grab a samich or some cookies next door when you're done!\n\nCheck it out...."
5,"Awesome!  Love this place, and yes, what took me so long?  As a Madison resident, many friends were surprised that I had never been here.  I am too.   Crowded Saturday night a couple of weeks ago.  Told about a 30 minute wait.  No problem, we found a spot at the bar and ordered, of course a couple of old fashioneds.  Delicious and made quickly and expertly in front of us.  Barely had time to settle up and we were buzzed via text messge(fancy) that a table was ready.   Sat in the newer part, and I need to start bringing my reader-cheaters, as I struggled to read the menu.  However, not a problem as Yelp reviews had let me know what to order; and we were NOT disappointed.\nStarter, of course with the cheese curds.  Amazing!  Light(possible?) for curds and perfectly melty.  We both had burgers.  She the Wisconsin and greatly enjoyed it and I the Old fashioned burger.  Both stood up to previous reviews, and I'm excited to go back; but not sure if stay with burger, or try many of the other wonderful looking items.  Enjoyed a couple of beers, from their broad selection.\n\nA new favorite!"
5,"Visiting from Omaha, Nebraska and wanted to start the day with something healthy. Had \""the greenie\"" juice and it was delicious!!! Loved the atmosphere and the customer service was awesome. Thank you, I will be back later :)"
5,"So far, it's the best ribeye steak I've ever had.  Very juicy and tasty.  Can't go wrong with this dish."
5,"Not much to say about the services at the building itself.  It's a federal courthouse, so the space is very solemn and official.  The building contains the U.S. Attorney's Office, U.S. Marshal's Office, offices of the U.S. Senators for Nevada, a jail, courtrooms and a small court cafe.\n\nI don't usually review government buildings, but architecturally, the building's facade is unique in Vegas. (cannondesign.com/#/expertise/project_catalog/143).   The entry to the courthouse stands beneath a giant metal grid nine floors above, which is held up by a long metal column.  Visitors walk across a long open plaza with a reflecting pool-style, overflow fountain.  Vegas does not have much architecture of note and the federal courthouse definitely stands out in the downtown skyline as unique."
5,Searched out this place for some comfort food.\nLove hotdogs so I went for the 2 chili cheese dogs and fries combo\nThe hotdogs were great and the chili perfect.\nTo top it off the fries were fresh cut and cooked to perfection.\nMakes my list of must go to when I am in the area again.\nOnly regret is not trying their ice cream
5,"I am so glad that we came back to Tomo. I absolutely loved what we had today. The Popcorn Lobster Roll was awesome and is definitely a new favorite. The Spicy Ninja Roll was really good too. It was almost like jalape\u00f1o popper sushi, but it worked. The thing I didn't like as much were the monkey balls. Mushrooms stuffed and fried. I have read a lot of reviews where people raved about them but we thought they were just ok. I probably wouldn't order them again myself but obviously from the other reviews people love them. If you have people that don't love sushi they have a lot of other things to choose from. The one downside- I ordered a margarita that was served in a tall glass and tasted like almost pure margarita mix. Guess I will stick to sake next time :)"
5,"This was the second time I had to get my windshield changed in the past two weeks.  The first time, I was not pleased with the company my insurance recommended, so this time I made the decision to use Star Windshield (although they were not on my insurance's preferred list).  They were very friendly and very accommodating as I changed my time and location several times.  Mike came out and took care of my car and he did an awesome job!  I am very pleased. \n\nAlso, I had my windows tinted at this same location 5 years ago and have not had a single issue yet!"
5,My husband and I ordered the I love Seoul burger - amazing. I had mine on rice vs the bun and that was incredible.\n\nOreo Shake - amazing\n\nMac and cheese nom noms - good (although I'm biased towards any other Mac and cheese that's not Kraft).\n\nService was good. Food took a little while to come out but we were in no hurry!
5,I've recently had some bad luck and this is my 3rd car in 1 year. We actually are pretty loyal and we're going to go back to the infiniti lot to get another infiniti but we swung through this lexus lot just to check it out. WOW... we found a beautiful car and Michael fletcher was our sales person. We couldn't have been more lucky. He took care of us and was a real person (not just a sales guy). I will never go with another brand or sales person ever again. Car shopping made easy and stress free
5,"We were in Vegas visiting from California and got excited that there was a jimmy johns... First tried it in Minnesota and fell in love. \n\nThis place in Vegas is in a newer shopping center but in a sketchy area by UNLV. \n\nWe had a great experience... Ordered _#4 turkey sub with peppers that was perfect! The bread is so fresh, and their chips are delicious...try the jalape\u00f1o ones !  Wish they would open up stores in California!!!"
5,"I'm somewhat embarrassed about this review as I work in Uptown, love this kind of cooking, have known Mert's existed but have never gone!  Remedied that on Wednesday morning and seriously had perhaps the best breakfast I've ever had.\n\nI got just the basics - scrambled eggs, sausage, home fries, biscuit and a buttermilk pancake on the side.  OMFG!  Perfectly cooked eggs, two huge sausage patties that were seared on the outside and moist/tender on the inside (yes they were cooked through!)  :)  Everything was just as I would order a breakfast if it were my last breakfast on earth.  My wife had similar but substituted bacon, grits and a sweet potato pancake. she was in breakfast nirvana as well.  Even the coffee was a notch above your typical breakfast joint fare.\n\nAND...  As I sat there eating this deliciousness, I had to stare at the lunch special menu board and there was not one thing on it I wouldn't have ordered.  There is no doubt I'm coming back soon for lunch.\n\nOn the service side it was fast, friendly and really nice teamwork among the servers with everyone paying attention to coffee cups getting low, etc.  What a jewel for the Queen City!"
5,"I contacted Leah to prepare for a trip to take my three dogs to Dog Beach. We went to a couple of private lessons to work on some useful things for Dog Beach. We came up with a plan and Leah was beyond flexible with her schedule to meet ours. Training was so much fun. Leah is funny, and gives clear direction so you know what you are doing!  She also gives you insight into understanding what the dogs are thinking or why they are acting a certain way. More importantly I felt no judgement about how I am with my dogs. They are my babies and I may overlook small behaviors that are actually more of a problem. Since our first lessons, I have gone to many meet and greets workshops and just signed up for an eight week class. I am beyond happy with the progress my dogs are making. I am so happy I found Dog House Training!!!"
5,"wow! I LOVE this place. it probably doesn't hurt that it's less than a mile from where I live too it's a small waxing studio inside of a larger salon and pretty easy to find. Shaina is a doll and did both my brows and a Brazilian wax (separate occasions) and both times she was very friendly and asked questions about what I wanted out of the wax and gave me exactly what I wanted. Also, this had to have been the fastest and least painful wax I've ever had. of course it hurt but it was literally over in 10 minutes so how bad can it really get? either way my experience here was great and I'll definitely be back!"
5,"When I'm eating the ethnic specialties of a foreign culture, I try to just shut up and let the natives tell me how to eat it - what condiments I should use, the mechanicals of eating it, what temperatures and tastes are best. Well, Paradise Valley Burger Company's cooks are natives of Burger Country and we are just visiting, so you should shut up and let them tell you how to eat their burgers. These guys are friggin burger wizards and I am completely enthralled by their flavor magic. Always ask about the weekly special. One time I came in and the weekly special was two thin patties, battered and fried, bacon on top and bottom, collard greens with garlic, and a maple-bacon-sriracha aioli on top of waffles.  WAFFLES.  Good God.  I almost wish I had died because I'm never going to eat anything that good ever again.\n\nThe one thing I could complain about is that their seasoned fries are way too salty."
5,"I really enjoy this place, its very close to my boyfriends house so we always come here. The chicken tikka masala is very good, and the goat curry is great!! The servers are very friendly and treat customers very well. It is worth trying.\n\nUpdate: Their lunch buffet has been getting better and better by the day!!!!"
5,"We've never had a bad meal here. The chicken.pita is one of the best in the valley! My hubby loves the gyro pita and Greek fries; my favorite side is the Greek salad. Although the pitas are great I crave the chicken shwarma meal with pita chips and rice....not sure what goes into making that rice but I could eat it every day! If you haven't been here yet, you're missing out!"
5,"I loved it here! I just moved to the southwest side from green valley and have been trying to find a good salon since February. I went to \""Polished\"" last week, made an appointment with a friend and was expecting the best because of how popular they seem to be. They have all the color selection but TERRIBLE customer service & prices were outrageous. Came in 7 min after our appointment time and they gave it away! Worst of it, the girls at the front were terribly rude. I was about ready to slap the snobbish blonde. I googled nails to find the nearest salon and \""Excellent nails\"" was it! Lisa was perfection! Loved the atmosphere & vibe, wasn't over crowded & the whole staff was very polite. Will definitely be my new go to salon! :)"
5,"Was a huge fan of Madonnas and I still miss my Conquistador salads but finally got around to coming down to the new place. Love it!\n\nIf its your first time Mario will walk you through what's what and the descriptions on the menu and labels make it easy if you're not familiar with the cousine. I admittedly wasn't, my only exposure to schwarma was the end of the Avengers movie. \n\nHave been three times now. Have gotten the kofta entree, the mix of two meats entree with shish kabobs and schwarma, and the schwarma entree by itself . \n\nIt's all delicious. Schwarma is my favorite thus far and the garlic sauce is a must. Personally I go for the tabouli and roasted potatoes for sides. The baklava is perfect as well. \n\nDefinitely give it a try, and its so much food for the money too."
5,"Absolutely lovely. A place I go when I want to reaffirm that there are still gracious places in the world. Adore the wonderful common spaces - lobby, Terrace Room. And the Tap Room is a cozy, warm - again, gracious. The staff is professional, but also warm - I really feel like I'm visiting a \""home\"" rather than just a generic hotel. Really love it - and glad I get to the William Penn frequently."
5,"Helpful, quick and cheap. The shady rental car company across the street (ACE rental car) screwed me out of my reservation. Without a reservation, I was in and out of the Hertz office with a better car for a similar price in 15 minutes."
5,"The first time I came here, the vendors for vegetables and fruits was plentiful. There were some essential items here and there that are priced within reason and budget, and out of the farmer's markets this one is in my top two. I bought several ears of corn earlier in the summer of this year, and have to say it was the sweetest, best tasting corn I've ever tasted in my life. All of their produce is high quality.\n\nTheir vendors seem to switch themselves, for the several other times I've visited, there were some vendors I liked that weren't around. It's a quite a bit of a drive for anyone who isn't located in or near Henderson, but is worth it for anyone looking to support you local growers and markets. You're always bound to find something new here!\n\n** BRING CASH WITH YOU ONLY! **"
5,Amazing food!!!! Love the turkey wrap!!!!! But also everything on the menu is great!!! I am pretty addicted to the place now!!!
5,"Love this place! We sat at the bar, I had the Pinot and the antipasto platter, and I couldn't finish it - it was huge. The soft cheese and peppered meat and roasted pears were so good with the wine. Then I had a blueberry muddled drink and a drink that was gin muddled with basil and black pepper that was yum!\n\nMy friend had the Caesar salad & the Kobe meatballs, and the dragonfruit daiquiri and a whiskey drink, all her food was very good as well. Pretty much all the servers and the manager talked with us as we were sitting there for a long time enjoying chatting- all were very warm and engaging."
5,"Absolutely incredible!  Not only does Garrett do great work, but his pricing is incredible too.  Never looked forward to getting my carpets done in the past, but now I have him on auto schedule lol.  Thanks so much for doing such a great job every time!  Oh and don't forget they do car upholstery and tile too!"
5,I tried so many Vape Shops and this place is my favorite! They have everything and the best qualities and varieties! The customer service is great and they are super friendly! \n\nHighly recommend!
5,"This place, hands-down, has THE BEST GF pizza!! The decor and atmosphere are more than enough reason to come, but the food...you'll never want to leave."
5,Aloha is my favor fro yo spot. The staff is always friendly and gives you little sample cups upon entering. its always very clean and they change their flavors frequently. They have couches and games to play while you eat your yogurt. Really cute place!
5,"I'm giving this concert a 5 not because I am a Celine Dion fan, but because of the overall experience of my night. We sat in Orch3 row M, great seats! You could hear her powerful voice so clearly, it wasn't like being at HP Pavillion of anything. I was stoked to have Dragone choreograph it since it definitely boosted my rating to a 5 instead of like a 4. When I was tuning out Celine, I could just get lost in the cool dancers and scenes being painted before me on the stage. My sister was sitting next to be balling her eyes out the whole time, wish I had a tissue for her. She LOVED the show, being a huge Celine fan. I liked a few of her songs, so it was cool to hear her belt them out live, but for the half of her songs I didn't know, I was glad for the other stuff on stage to keep me busy. Celine looks really good after all these years. I wouldn't go again, but it was good to see once. If you like Celine, you should go since it's her last year. They also take away your camera but they do it in an orderly way so you can get it back easily after the show, it wasn't a mad house. I was impressed how easy they made it."
5,Went in tonight with my wife and the place was packed. We were seated in 5 minutes max and were served our drinks immediately. Our server took our order and apologized in advance because she said the kitchen was a bit behind. 10 minutes later our order was served and the waitress refilled our drinks several times. The pho was good and there was plenty. We are from Northern Cal and I have been to plenty of Vietnamese restaurants and I would put this one up there with my favorites now.
5,"Enjoy the cool modern decor while sipping on a cool beer and a hot slice of NY style pizza.  I took the opportunity of using a Amazon.com coupon and discorvering my new neighborhood pizza place.  My boyfriend and I started on toasted ravioli with a side of marinara, good chewy bites with a simple sauce.  We decided to taste a NY style pizza, the crust had a nice bite and the topping were generous.  Our server was attentive and ensured our drinks were filled and the food was tasty,  Surely I'll be back again."
5,"So much more than a gym!\nWhen my sister or brother visits from NJ they are SO envious of my LTF membership!  \""it's like a country club!\"" they say...\nAnyway, I joined in 2005 when I was pregnant with my second child and I've been a happy customer ever since.\nMy kids (now 6 and 10) don't want to go to the Child Center anymore, but I can't complain--they went for 6 years and it gave mommy a much needed break several times a week!\nThank you Lifetime Fitness for a great facility."
5,"If you are a cocktail enthusiast, look for Julian at Vesper--you won't be sorry.  He's so knowledgeable and passionate about cocktails.  A true artist in residence."
5,"Great quality for great value.\n\nThis is one of my favourite brunch places, it's super cute and is steps away from the Atwater Market and Lachine Canal. It's ideal for those summer days when you'd like to take a little stroll or bike ride after. It's usually busy and tends to have a line up during typical brunch hours, so the earlier (or later) you get in.. the better! \n\nI'm a big fan of their omelettes (the one's served in the cast iron skillet, too) and their benedicts! Their menu offers up so many varieties, all of which are delicious! Their potatoes are made to perfection... perfectly spiced, perfectly crispy on the outside, and perfectly soft on the inside! \n\nWhether you like it salty or sweet... you will not be disappointed."
5,"We need one of these in New York. And there should be one closer to the strip. I didn't mind going out of our way to come here though, it was totally worth it. I wished that more people came with us so that we could have ordered a wider variety of food to try but there's always next year! \n\nWe started with the duck baos, which were tender, juicy, and flavorful. We also got an order of truffle fries with spicy dipping sauce to share. For burgers I got the Kalbi burger, fiance got the Kiki, future-bro-in-law got the Shogun. I think the Kalbi was the best of the three. The Kiki was good but a little too sweet for a burger. \n\nOverall, we'll be back for sure, especially for the oxtail friese! See you again next year!"
5,"I needed a bulb replacement on my Z4.  I waited about two months before doing anything about it since I didn't want to spend more than a car payment alone on a simple bulb replacement at the BMW dealer . . . then I remembered the sign I passed almost everyday for German Motor Works right on Scottsdale Road.  Where did that sign go? Then I thought, wasn't the place just behind the Chevron Car Wash?  \n\nA quick call confirmed it was still there.  Andrew was so nice and made me feel like my little bulb replacement was as important as an engine overhaul! \""Just give me a call before you come over and I'll take care of it,\"" was all he said, and I knew that my little Z4 was going to be in good hands!  He's a really laid back guy who wants to make your BMW repair as easy and financially painless as possible.\n\nWhile I was there, I asked his pricing on the Inspection 2 that I would need soon, and it was so reasonable, I decided to get it done at the same time!  \n\nI wouldn't hesitate to refer any BMW owner to Andrew and his German Motor Works. My little Z4 is my baby and he handled her with kid gloves!"
5,Great find!!! Little place that you could easily pass and not see it. Don't miss this place though cause really great food.
5,"I don't normally write Yelp reviews, but seeing as I've been eating at Aquaknox for almost 10 years now, I am compelled! My family and I are frequent diners along the Las Vegas strip and we've had our share of fine dining (Joel Robuchon, Picasso, Le Cirque, N9NE steakhouse, Eiffel Tower, etc.) and not once has Aquaknox disappointed us! I also lived in San Francisco/Bay Area for 5 years and nothing has compared to the quality of food or service that this restaurant provides!\n\nAquaknox's level of service is unparalleled. With the advent of their new manager, Min, we are always being taken care of and leave satisfied beyond our heart's content. One evening, my mother had requested for a pina colada, but it was not on their menu as they did not have a blender. My mom had no problem requesting for another drink, yet Min personally ran to neighboring restaurants to find a blender. For years, this has been our go-to seafood place (not to mention our favorite restaurant) when we're looking for a fancier-than-normal-kind-of-night.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend the following dishes:\n- Steamed mussels (request for extra bread!)\n- Lobster cocktail w/ citrus garlic aioli\n- Sweet shrimp and lump crab salad\n- Lobster bisque (you can smell its heavenly essence from across the table)\n- Filet mignon / Surf n Turf\n- Pacific prawns on couscous with lobster cream\n- Red Snapper on truffle potato puree\n\nIf you're looking for good seafood and a good time, go to Aquaknox. You can't beat it!"
5,"I love visiting D & D. This place is about the atmosphere as well as the food. On the weekdays the place is bustling with corporate America, moms meeting up and exchanging baby stories, a few networkers collaborating on a project and one or two snooty folks. It make up a wonderful array of folks having lunch. \n\nOn the weekends there are families, dogs, children, babies, old folks, young folks sharing stories and sitting outside listening to the great performer chosen for that weekend. There are misters around the patio area.\n\nI love the nooks and crannies where you can sit inside or outside. The sandwiches are good. I love the turkey on dark rye with avocado. They are generous on all fronts. Yes the place is pricey! Drinks, sandwiches and chips can run almost $30 for two people! However you get a free small concert on the weekends. The kids run loose, the dogs bark and it is fun! The wait staff is incredibly friendly and several folks have been working there for years. \n\nThis is not a place for those individuals looking for a fancy dancy sandwich. This is a place to have fun, relax and enjoy some good food and a great atmosphere!"
5,"Just wanted to take some time to say how much I love everything about this place.  Their fish, meat and produce are all simply amazing.  The staff is always SO friendly and theres always tons of testers (yum).\nBest salad bar in the valley, hands down.  Their prepared foods are really nice as well.  The cheese dept totally rocks, I especially love the little bin w/ small pieces of reasonably priced cheese, I usually grab one or two pieces of something I've never tried when I go.\nKeep it up Whole Foods!"
5,"I love Downtown Las Vegas also known as the 9th island. I'm a Hawaii girl living in Los Angeles, so when I go to Vegas, I always stop at the Cal for a slice of home. The local style food at Market Street Cafe (they have bomb Butterfish) and the plate lunch style grinds at Aloha Specialties are ONO! \n\nIf you're not from Hawaii, you probably won't understand why a 30-something would want to hang at the Cal, the place is like a Hawaiian version of the movie Cocoon. But I love seeing the old Japanese and local people from Hawaii gambling with their wheel chairs and sometimes even oxygen tanks. They go! \n\nI've been staying at the Cal since small kid time, so its very nostalgic for me, lots of memories there. I love seeing the mixed faces and pidgin accents :) Also I've been brainwashed since childhood (they mail regulars a magazine with pictures of all the Hawaii winners) that I will win if play at a Sam Boyd hotel. Sure enough, I won 1000 quarters on Wheel of Fortune on my last visit, must be because I rubbed the shaka buddha's belly :) \n\nSee you in March 2014, yay :)"
5,"Off the beaten path, this is defintely a Vegas must-see. As mentioned, tours must be set up in advance and cost a nominal fee, but well worth it.\n\nA photographer's dream, the retired signs of old Vegas are arranged in two fenced yards. Our tour guide revealed some interesting tidbits in our hour-ish tour - if you are very familiar with Vegas you may glean a few little-known facts.\n\nOtherwise, the Boneyard speaks for itself. Some of the signs are in varying stages of disrepair, which makes for many beautifully sad photo ops. As someone who isn't incredibly interested in picture-taking, even I found myself playing around with the various settings on my camera and different photographic angles.\n\nIn order to truly appreciate Vegas, visit the Boneyard and pay tribute to the past."
5,The Spa at Camelback Inn is one of my favorite places in Arizona. The resort is beautiful and the spa is amazing. The grounds of the spa are gorgeous and tranquil. The Swedish massage is the best I have ever had. Even the shampoo and hand soap smell delicious - I had to buy them for myself. A day here takes away all my worries. I am addicted!
5,"After hearing about this place from friends and fellow Yelpers, I had to check it out for myself. Oyster Bar is located inside the Palace Station casino and seats only 18 people. There was about 6 people waiting in line ahead of us at around 3am, and we were seated a little over an hour after arriving. The chefs were friendly and worked as fast as they could, but food took about 20-30 minutes to be served. I decided on a half dozen oysters ($10 between 1-9am) and the highly raved about Combo Pan Roast ($23.99). \n\nThe oysters were freshly shucked and some of the best I've ever had. I can't compare my pan roast to other places since I've never had it before, but it's a really thick stew made out of brandy, tomato and cream. The Combo Pan Roast was full of large pieces of crab, lobster and shrimp and had the perfect amount of spice for my taste at a level 8. It was super rich, creamy, and absolutely delicious. The serving was enough for two people, so I had plenty to take home with me. I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas!"
5,The sandwiches are like no other and the wings are great and even can be ordered grilled. The beer selection is absurd.
5,"I absolutely love this path! It's a great place to ride, walk or run without the dangers of traffic and the scenery is gorgeous! I'm a concierge for a resort in North Scottsdale so I get to talk with and make suggestions for people day in and day out. If you are active and it's the summertime don't be fraud to get outside and enjoy the day the green belt trail is a beautiful path. Bring plenty of water for this 41 mile round trip stretch. Along this stretch you will have no lack of eateries and quant spots to grab a beer/wine. Hope to see ya out there!"
5,"If you like spicy food, you should try their camarones al diablo.  The portions are pretty big.  I can always make two giant burritos out of this meal.  Sooooo good.  I go there often."
5,"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place! the food took me back to being in my mom's kitchen learning how to cook. I was fortunate enough to meet the owner and she is just as nice as her food is good...and that's saying a lot! \nI can't wait to bring my friends here, they are gonna love me even more!"
5,Grrr no green tea yogurt.  The girl at the counter was so sweet and nice and she told me that they would not bring the macha green tea to the Vegas location.\nSo I guess the only place I can get it is when I go back to LA since they have it there. (Sad Face)  But I still have Jamba Juice so I can suffer for just a little bit. lol
5,"I followed Jillian to this salon, because she is so amazing, and despite the drive from the West Valley, I love this salon. It has an energetic, kicky vibe and a friendly, convivial environment. \n\nAs for Jillian, she has the rare ability of not only listening and knowing exactly what your hair needs and you want, but also has the talent to execute that vision.  In her tactful, poised way, she gets there, wherever your \""there\"" is. When I get  compliments on my hair, i am happy to recommend Jillian; everyone I have referred to her has switched over, including my husband.  And it's an added bonus to show off the new do at one of the trendy little restaurants in the Roosevelt afterward."
5,"when you walk in, there is a DOG DRESSED AS A BELLHOP!!! HA!\n\nthis show is incredible, start to finish. i don't want to ruin anything but there is a talking bunny rabbit, cats taking death-defying leaps, dogs doing just about anything, and an adorable russian family doing old-tymey russian family circus shit.\n\nthe best part is that all of the animals are rescues...and its totally cheap for a vegas show...and did i mention it RULES???\n\nanyone who didn't like this show clearly hates fun."
5,"They sell bento boxes to-go.  There are fish, chicken, and combination Bento boxes.  It's a relatively cheap lunch - like $4 for a small Bento and $6 for a large one.  It's high quality food for the price."
5,"Great chicken burrito. Even though I didn't get the enthusiastic greeting that everybody else received, the guy behind the counter at about 7:30pm did eventually give me some samples of one meat and that jalapeno cream cheese too. The cream cheese and both of the salsa's at the salsa bar were all in the hot category, even the green one that normally is mild. Go for the pico de Gallo if you don't like things too hot like myself. The beef in red sauce also had a hefty kick, but the chicken was composed of huge chunks of white meat that the cook put back on the grill before piling it atop my custom made burrito that was in progress.\n   These things stand out here:\n1. Chipotle tortilla (choice of 4 others too)\n2. Roasted Corn to put inside the burrito\n3. Homemade Horchata\n4. Free Homemade Chips with your order\n\nThis guy knows how to roll one too. The ingredients were all super fresh and the burrito was one of the better ones I have come across. It's in a strip mall and it just says Taqueria on the outside, but this is my new go-to fast Mexican place. It will blow away any chain and my total bill was $8.18 for the burro and drink. Thanks to previous Yelpers for uncovering this local gem."
5,"I visit the Hurricane for Jamaican Jerk wings.  The flavor was a bit odd to me at first, kind of a sweet jerk sauce with a little bite but not too hot.  The more of them I ate, the better they tasted.  The wings are meaty and they have a 5 piece that is great for lunch.  PBR is cheap all the time."
5,"I felt compelled to give this place 5 stars because there are a bunch of \""reviewers\"" giving it lesser stars for the dumbest reason.  Sorry, they don't have shrimp burritos.  Sorry, this isn't a sit down resturant.  Its a take out place.  This doesn't take away from the fact that this place makes the best burritos I've ever had.  It is all fresh ingrediants.  It is a fantastic place for lunch.  \n\nBTW have a brain when you write a review on here."
5,"I came here because of the great reviews. I can honestly tell you that the staff here are attentive and care. The first time I came here I waited only 10 minutes. Office staff are polite and treat you like a family member. The doctor was attentive and listened to what I had to say. I was iffy about coming, since I dont like medical offices. I enjoyed my visit here. I felt comfortable with the staff."
5,Cute little free museum in the heart of Scottsdale! The staff are super friendly and knowledgeable!  I could spend a whole day chatting with them! You must walk through if you are in town!
5,"My new go-to place for Happy Hour drinks! Very affordable especially for my Midori Sour!! \n\nI ordered the Tuna Tartare, Pork&Beef Sliders, Jambalaya, and the Ribeye in medium. Very delicious and fresh! Despite it being Happy Hour we were escorted to a nice Vip-looking table that had curtains for privacy-- not bad since it was only in the afternoon!! Our bartender/waiter was very accommodating and he looks like a taller, cleanly shaven version of Iron Man lol! Also, it was a nice touch when their chef personally served our main dishes and told me good luck on eating my steak thinking I couldn't finish it... But I did! Overall, the barstaurant gave off a fancy schmancy dining experience but for an affordable price."
5,"Quick friendly service.  These guys actually want you to get the cheapest price with the best coverage.  Imagine that, from an insurance person?"
5,"Just stumbled upon this place right near my apartment and went here for breakfast two days in a row.  Best breakfast place in scottsdale hands down and not overly crowded unlike other ones on scottsdale rd.  chimichurro sauce and the quality of bread for the toast made this,place stand out."
5,"This place is unique... the cuisine is similar to Japanese Tapas. Try the bacon wrapped asparagus, beef tongue skewer (trust me), Pork wrapped Gobo, tempura asparagus and some sake bombs. \n\nWhat's even more amazing is the price!"
5,"Awesome!!   Dr. Josh spends ample time explaining everything to his patients, and has extensive knowledge.  This is not a 2 minute back crack, we will see you back kind of office.  LOVE the ice therapy before and after my sessions."
5,"Fantastic place for a nice, healthy meal.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  It's also a good spot for a great smoothie.  The menu was put together by nutrition experts; a perfect post workout cafe."
5,"I came In here wanting an exact nail type. I also got a pedicure. Peter did an absolute perfect job on my stiletto nails. They're amazing ! I would recommend this store to all my girl friends in Vegas, since I am passing through. Next time I'm in Vegas I will return here. Thank you."
5,"OMGosh! The best donut I have ever had! They make it to order, you choose the toppings and it comes out hot and delicious! I got caramel and toasted coconut and it was amazing! They also serve coffee, fresh beans delivered weekly! Espresso , and fresh iced tea made brewed with tea leaves. I am definitely going to be a regular. I just got home and I'm craving it already"
5,Love Lish nails! The staff and owners are so nice. My mom and I come here every other weekend because we genuinely like it. I have never been to a nail salon so clean. They open up a new package of tools every visit and use a new liner for the tub with every pedi. The owners Levi and Thao always make sure the customers are happy and have water lol. One time me and my mom were waiting a while and Levi offered us a coupon for a complimentary ice cream from Baskin Robbins :)
5,"This bakery and the staff ROCK!! They were able to make our wedding cake with just a week notice!! Sent sample cakes home, delivered the cake , and above all, gluten free! \nstellar service, scrumptious cake!!\nThank you!!"
5,"Best experience in Las Vegas.   Great service, Incerdible food and of course great wines...  I look forward to going back again.."
5,"Every time I'm in Pittsburgh I find it hard to stay away from Espresso a Mano.  I'm a little obsessed with unique coffee, so I usually find myself ordering their specialty pour-over cup no matter what.  I've enjoyed single source Sidamo beans from Ethiopia here regularly.  In addition to the coffee, they offer ample seating area and free WiFi for guests to mingle and work.  When the weather is nice, they'll open the garage door up for an al-fresco experience.  Please go here and support good coffee."
5,"Great beer selection.  Ever changing.  Rivals most of the spots in Pittsburgh for great selection of craft beers.  Hamburger selection is diverse, unique twist on dinner menu and a good sandwich and salad options.  A generous wine selection that will not break the bank and cocktail creations for everyone.  I say yes and give it a shot."
5,"I have been coming here since they opened, over 4 years now, and I've never been rude to, always got top notch service, been early AND late for my appointments and have NEVER been met with attitude. I've sent friends here and they ALL left 100% satisfied and happy. Those two 1-star ratings are a rare thing here. There must be a good reason why Emporium can have higher prices than every other nail salon on the SW side yet still remain open in this economy.  All I can say is that Toby and his crew are a class  act and deserve the business they get and those bashers must have either come with attitude or misinterpreted their entire experience.  If you are seeking a**kissing, of course Emporium is not the place to go.  They do honest good work"
5,"I actually found Copperline plumbing (Gabe) on Yelp and I'm thankful I did. I was out of town on business and my wife called me and said our kitchen floor was hot. Well, we don't have floor warmers so we knew something was wrong. We knew  enough to know we had to turn off the hot water, and then we found Copperline on Yelp, and called Gabe. He had us call a leak detector and have them come out and locate the water leak and then he would come out and estimate and repair it.\n\nThe locating company did not do a great job at locating the leak so it presented Gabe with an extra challenge, but Gabe figured it all out and did a great job reparing it. I also had to replace my water heater at the same time and he took care of that as well, and disposed of my old one. Gabe is a workhorse. He does whatever it takes to get the job done right, the first time. He's patient and understanding and has great customer service skills. \n\nThe job he did for my house required re-routing the primary water line, and it was not an easy job. I have an older house and he had to cut some walls and crawl around in the attic a little, but he did everything it took to make sure it was done right. I appreciate that and we will ALWAYS call Gabe for all our plumbing needs from now on."
5,"I love that the Rubber Duck has a page where you can review him!\n\nWhat else can you say about the duck other than the fact that he is awesome?!  What is not to love about a giant rubber duck?  Stories about the duck indicated that the artist wanted to create something that reminded us of the whimsy of childhood.  Mission accomplished.  \n\nI first saw the duck on the night of his debut.  Downtown was bustling with activity as there were several events going on (along with the duck's arrival and bridge party).  I was giddy with excitement as we approached him.  It was a picture perfect evening and he looked incredible with PNC Park as a backdrop.  It was nice to see so many boaters paying him a visit as well.\n\nI was fortunate to see the duck every morning on my way in to work.  And it brought a smile to my face ever time.\n\nConfession time.  I loved the duck so much that when we heard his next appearnce was in Norfolk, VA, we made arrangements to pick up the nieces and nephews and take a road trip to visit him.  Still brought me just as much joy.  Maybe even more since I also had the experience of sharing him with kids.\n\nI hope he makes a return to Pittsburgh soon!"
5,"I found my new favorite liquor store. I've been wanting to come here for a while, but I just never mad it out there. Well, I wanted a keg for my Super Bowl party and I gave this place a call. They not only had the cheapest keg around, but they also had the cheapest deposit too.\n\nThis will probably be the only place I go from now on when I'm hunting for a unique beer AND when I hit the bars. Oh yeah... there is a bar in the basement. Cool, huh?"
5,"Just driving by this place makes my mouth water! I don't know if the air around Pig & Pickle actually smells like bacon or if it's just my imagination getting the best of me.\n\nService was friendly and prompt. I had the porchetta which was absolutely amazing. Each bite had a slightly different taste and texture. The inner portion was a little bit spicy and the outer portion was like bacon--but better (how is that possible?). I also had the pork tacos with kimchi and they were great! Tender, shredded pork with kimchi on top. The kimchi wasn't at all overwhelming.\n\nAnd for dessert--the nutella ice cream. This is a game changer for me! I don't usually order dessert because I always overdo it during dinner, but thankfully my date insisted. It was delicious and I found myself continuing to dream about that ice cream and figure out when I can have it again. I can't wait to go back to Pig & Pickle--my new goal might be to try everything on their menu!"
5,"Let me do you a favor and save you any argument on your next venture to the Strip of what the best buffet in Vegas is. It's here.\n\nYes, for breakfast it is a little pricier than the Rio or pretty much the other options. But it is 1000% worth it. They have everything here. You've got the American breakfast basics...and the Mexican breakfast basics...and the low-carb basics. There's Asian fare (including donuts I haven't had since in China). There's an entire section of charcuterie and cheese (it's phenomenal cheese). They have pressed juice. They have mini everything. They have sugar free and sugar OD desserts. There's a ton of places to sit. It's divine.\n\nWhen my boyfriend and I went, we went about 30-45 minutes before they switched to lunch. So, we got to try the breakfast AND the lunch options. I would have eaten more (there were these awesome looking sliders and soups) but while the mind was willing, the body was not strong enough.\n\nI feel this will be my only buffet in Vegas from here on out. My only regret of coming here is not having a big enough stomach to cram in everything I want to consume."
5,"A great morning at Prohibition (the new name of Vino Vin et Terrace) with the new signage up and all. I had the deep friend pain perdu with fried chicken while my BF couldn't resist the breakfast poutine (fries with cheese curds, bacon, sausage gravy topped with a fried egg and hollandaise). Scrumptious!\n\nI love the bottomless cup of Joe and the attentive service. Their menu is very creative, stuffed ricotta pancakes, banh mi breakfast, and Bavarian benedict to name a few of the dishes you won't find anywhere else in Montreal. Definitely one of my favorite breakfast spots in Montreal!"
5,"best. drunk. food. EVER!!! it's right next to tao and its open really late which is perfect if you're hungry after sweating off all the alcohol you've consumed during the night. i've been here twice and never had to wait...but then again it was like at 2 or 3. BUT, there were still a ton of people there. i got the chicken and waffles...which was heavenly. i shared it with my friend and still had some to take home, so the portions are definitely huge. I also had some of my friend's chicken flautas...MAAAAAAAAAN with the green sauce. SOOOO GOOD!! we took that home too. to me, grand lux cafe is like a less classier cheesecake factory. its a lot cheaper, but the food is still just as good in terms of quality and taste. and our server was so nice. I can't imagine having to serve a bunch of drunk annoying asses all night. if you're gonna eat unhealthy after a long night of drinks, might as well come here and pay a few extra dollars and have the most orgasmic drunk food ever, rather than go to mcdonalds or some other fast food place, just saying!"
5,"I went to Las Vegas with pale white legs and bushy eyebrows, but left Las Vegas with sleek tanned legs and beautifully trimmed eyebrows, thanks to Vanity Flair. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about women's beauty needs. I definitely recommend this business to any woman who is looking for a pampering experience. This will be one of my first stops the next time I'm in Vegas."
5,"The absolute best beer bar in Las Vegas. They have the best selection of beer available in any bar. A constantly changing rotation of taps including rare, hard to find beers that no one else has. Greg Koch from Stone brewing has even come by a couple of times celebrating the amount of Stone beers that they sell through.\n\nThey host beer festivals throughout the year, which is a great time to try some never before heard of beers and meet a lot of great people in the process. \n\nA must on any Beer Geeks list."
5,"Best vet in town! My dog gets excited when we pull up to the office. My Japanese chin had some tricky allergies that I could not get rid of. He would chew his flesh raw. I had been to several vets to try and treat his allergies. Commonweath and their amazing staff fixed him right up. He has never had any issues again!\nA friend of mine, had to put her cat to sleep a few months ago. The vet from commonwealth came to her house to put her cat to sleep in the comfort of the pets own home, The vet and the vet tech were AMAZING. Very caring and even mourned with us. It meant alot to my friend. I can't say enough good things about Commonweath Animal Hospital. They are Awesome!!!!!"
5,I love this Pizza.  I go here often due to the affordable slice specials and the terrific taste.  I get the Chicken Wings as well which are phenomenal!!
5,"This place is actually pretty awesome for a strip hotel bar.  Went here a few weeks ago hoping for some decent brew prices and a place to chill and it fit the bill completely.  Bartenders were friendly and good with service, beers were reasonably priced for Vegas, and the atmosphere was very social.  They have TVs to watch various games, it's a comfortable atmosphere, and the beer/cheese dip appetizer I had was surprisingly delicious.  I'm from Wisconsin and when you're from there you know your cheese but this stuff was REALLY good.  We also were just in the mood for a snack and it turned out to be plenty filling.\n\nWhen you're down there anyway spending gobs of money on all sorts of entertainment, this place is a pretty good stop for slowdown in the action.  Good down to earth feel; highly recommend.  I normally reserve my five-star reviews for something spectacular but between all the bars/clubs I've been to in Vegas including other Irish bars this restaurant actually made me feel better than most so I have to give it some props."
5,"The best pizza ever ate, crust and cheese and yum!  Delicious!  2year old says yum yum too as we eat!!"
5,Very good food at an awesome price.  Very creative menu featuring southwestern flavors in your casual menu offerings.  The tuna nachos and mushroom quesadilla were wonderful appetizers.  The chile burger and pork sandwiches were exceptional. All in all a wonderful lunch experience.
5,"Been back a few more times since last review (closest restaurant to home) and they are still serving great food but the service had really stepped it up a notch. the waiters/waitress are fantastic and go out of their way to make sure your happy and they are personable. \n\nagain, the sausage gnocchi is still my favorite. \n\nkeep it up!"
5,"This is another pizza spot that me and my wife and have grown fond of. It isn't take and bake, but nevertheless, it is very very good. Made fresh from scratch right in front of you, with real italian sausage, this place is awesome. They have other items, but when we come we always get the Pizza special with Pepperoni and Sausage and a drink. It's two 18 inch slices I might add and the drink for $4.99. Unbeatable in my opinion, especially since it's good."
5,Free wifi if your smoking cigars.\nThe beer is cold and the prices are very reasonable.\nFreaky behind the bar is awesome
5,"Must say I was amazed with this place. The waitress was funny, helpful, and knowledgeable. We started by ordering the chicken satay,  I then choose the pa nang curry (hot) and must say I absolutely loved this dish. The gf ordered a spicy chicken, rice and basil dish which was equally good. As I always do, I ordered my thai iced tea with cream and must say that the large is just that. The pricing was more than fair, the place was clean, and staffed with very friendly individuals. I would definitely recommend it, and surely see myself returning in the near future"
5,"Absolutely amazing from start to finish. We sat on the right side, between the far right and middle and about 10 rows up or so. Comfy seats with cup holders. Very easy to get in and out. You can bring snacks in from the concession stand. The green juggling girl, the two dudes in the spinning circles, the girl jumping on and off the long stretchy platform...absolutely stunning. The only thing that I noticed is that the two clowns on a few occasions were filling up time and there performances weren't as funny anymore."
5,Absolutely great with kids good food great prices and one amazing Italian beef sandwich!!! It's a must try when your at el mirage park!!!!
5,"Choose your crust ( white, wheat or Gluten Free), sauce, cheese (dairy or dairy-free) and as many fresh toppings as you like and for $8.95. Yes please! I like this concept you cannot phone in your order but you can order to go. These are thin crust pizzas but they are tasty! Thank you My Pie for opening up near my home."
5,My food boner went from 6 to midnight after walking in here. \n\nI'll never shop at another grocery store. Vons lost my business the second I took a look inside this place and shopped there for the first time.\n\nI highly recommend shopping here if you live in the area. Highly.
5,"Great Mexican food!! Loved that they let us try all the meat before we ordered! All the options were fantastic, so hard to make a decision. I got 3 tacos and my fianc\u00e9e got the wet burrito. We left stuffed but didn't want to stop eating! Wonderful customer service too!!"
5,"I just love this little sandwich shop located next door to a cute used bookstore.  The menu has breakfast and lunch items as well as italian sodas, smoothies and Boco drinks.\n\nI had the California which I had in a wrap that included turkey, avacado, sprouts, bacon and mayo with fruit and a cookie.  It was very, very yummy!\n\nThe owner is very nice.  They also deliver locally and you can either call your order in or fax it in to be delivered."
5,"Dolores G and I first encountered this place on the Yelp Old Town shopping crawl. She and I split a deal they were having and made a reservation a few weeks ago. The normal price is $35 for 2 hours and $45 for 3 hours. We got the 3 hours. \n\nD and I went on a Thurs night and the art of choice was a Van Gogh, I think. The red poppies one. I think it is cool that they have selected themes and they will give you something to trace the artwork on your canvas before painting. I opted for something different, and painted my rendition of a cherry blossom tree. They provided the paints, canvas, wine glasses, bottle opener, music, and instruction on the various techniques for the painting. I really had a great and came home with something I was proud to hang up!"
5,"Chilaquiles... OMG the chilaquiles!\n\nIn case you don't know, chilaquiles is a Mexican dish of fried softened tortilla chips covered with salsa or mole and cheese and broiled. They are one of my favorite foods and I've ordered them at countless places. Border Grill gets them right. Very right!\n\nIf you don't care for chilaquiles, this review isn't for you."
5,"Love love love. The appetizer portions are a WEE bit bigger here than in LA. Loved the mixed greens, shishito peppers and mochi ice cream. However, was not a fan of the lobster dynamite. Loved the ambiance, too!"
5,"My favorite meal in Vegas for this trip. I work as a freelance reporter and was carrying a heavy camera bag, so I was pleased when were showed to our table and the wait staff offered to take and store my bag...thank you!\n\n Our waiter was great, but on top of the already good service, the manager took a few minutes to talk to us as well and recommend a sister restaurant out in LA. The biscuits served ahead of time were delicious, the Caesar salad we split was great but nothing special (it's just a Caesar after all). \n\n  For dinner my friend and I both had Seared Day Boat Scallops*\nButternut Squash Puree, Brussel Sprouts, Pear, Pecans, Brown Butte. So good! Not as good as the similar dish at 230 Forest Ave in Laguna Beach. This dish needed a bit more texture. Maybe some crispy leeks on top. Very good but texture overall was a bit mushy. For a side we shared the truffled mac and cheese which was good, but I don't really care for broccoli in my mac and cheese...what's the point?! I also love a little bit of breading on top of a baked mac and cheese as well, but that didn't stop me from chowing down none the less.\n\nNo room for dessert this time but a great night of food. I'll put in on the list for a go back from Vegas along with Strip Steak at Mandalay Bay."
5,"Fun, affordable & delicious. A bit loud for the older set but great music, free shots, and more food than you can eat. Family of 4 ate for less than $50."
5,"This was the most amazing thing I have ever seen!  At some parts I felt like I was stuck in one of Goya's greatest nightmares - and I loved it.\n\nEvery once in a while (for filler) they added some awful salsa/disco dance routine (think bad choreography featuring Fez from That 70's show).  I actually felt embarrassed for the dancers... but that's OK because everything else was so amazing, that the show still deserves 5 stars.\n\nThe women there have insane muscles.  I kept looking for Captain Winky , but couldn't find him.  I still have my doubts about some of them.\n\nIf you are going... here are my tips on where to sit. \n- The first row is a \""splash zone\"", and your face will be in that dry ice fog stuff for the first 20 minutes of the show\n- The aisles next to the performer stairs are creepy - there are dancers dressed as devils jumping over the rails at you\n- The rows are LONG... so try to get next to stairs (not the performer stairs).  The last row in the theater is 31 seats across.  That's a lot of people that need to stand up if somebody in the middle needs to use the restroom!"
5,"One of my favorite spots to get delicious Montreal bagels. Prices are cheap, service is quick (mostly because it's CASH ONLY! THANK YOU!!!!!) and the bagels are fantastic. I've pretty much ate all their bagel selections at this point with my personal favorites being the Sesame and Rosemary bagels. \n\nNEWBIES! Make sure to request the freshest bagels, particularly if this is your first visit and you heard how awesome this place is, they WILL OBLIGE with a smile!\n\n(-1 star) The only downside as some have mentioned previously and correctly, is this is PURELY a bagel joint. This means you can buy your cream cheese or whatnot from their freezers... but you have to construct your own bagel sandwiches elsewhere. There are indeed a few cafes nearby that may allow you to come in to setup if you purchase a coffee (a great option for those of you who like doing this) but be prepared for this as well as some places frowning on this somewhat. Lastly, the prices for things in the freezer are far more expensive than you'd get from most other places."
5,Yet another EXCELLENT dinner. The Parmesan crusted filet was like BUTTAH. I'm am addicted to the Heart of Italy combo. Very good service and The zucchini strips were divine! Chef Rod is Da BOMB!!!
5,"Although they are a little hard to spot from the street outside, it's absolutely worth visiting this coffee spot inside the skyscraper lobby.  We tried a bulletproof (americano with butter and coconut oil) for the first time here, and it absolutely rocked.  They were offering samples of a green smoothie, and that was delicious too.  The staff was fantastic; they gave us great insider advice on what to see in Pittsburgh."
5,Still dreaming of the lobster gnocchi!!!   Delicious!   Service was excellent and we all received a complimentary glass of champaign with our dessert!  Excellent Italian food!!!
5,"Oh how I love Del Frisco's! I come here every Charlotte Restaurant Week and for special occasions. The food here is delicious, never overcooked and always fresh! My favorite entree is the beef medallions and my favorite appetizer is the turtle soup. I would recommend this place to anyone. It is expensive, but worth it!"
5,"I have seen The Phantom of the Opera musical a handful of times and I was pleased to see that Phantom the Vegas show stayed pretty true to the original.\n\nAside from merging a scene or two together and omitting a line here and there, the music and dialogue was pretty similar.  The visual effects were even better than the original.  More fireworks, trapdoors, and surprises...I loved it!\n\nThe venue in the Venetian isn't too big and our seats on the right side orchestra were a great deal.  I could see everything!"
5,"So good!   Just got takeout, the grilled skirt steak and vegetables were incredible!   Looking forward to future visits and trying more of the menu!"
5,I like that they change up the flavors and let you serve yourself. They have a good quality selection and it's the best prices for quality.
5,"With the funky Vegas-esque leather decor laden with mirrors & televisions located adjacent to a strip club you may be deceived into thinking this is not the farm-to-table, ethically sourced, non-gmo gem it is!  Picky eaters bring your best shot, Paco will answer with healthy flavorful Mexican food from recipes passed down through his family.  You will not need salt and pepper at your table everything is expertly seasoned to perfection.  The tri-fecta of salsas has a spice level for every palate,  Im a huge fan of the habanero (yellow means caution mi amigos) finally some heat!  \n \nMahi tacos are out of this world!  \n\nGet the sweet Tiffany to wait on you, she is a doll!"
5,"We've gotten takeout here before, but it was my first time for a sit-down meal.  GREAT!  No complaints, great food, pleasant service, reasonable prices, and a huge variety, some things I haven't seen on other Mexican menus before.  What's not to love?   This may be my go-to place for Mexican for awhile as I want to try so many things on the menu."
5,"Scott and his team at AZUSA builders are amazing!  They are always on time, professional, and I would refer them to ANYONE!"
5,"Excellent Boba's! I always get the Taro flavor wherever I go, and this place makes it the best! Perfectly blended with great boba. The staff is young, but very friendly and the service is always quick. Sucks that its far away from me now that I moved to PHX, but nonetheless, when I'm stocking up on Asian groceries from Lee Lee's, I always make sure to stop in. Especially during the summer. So refreshing!"
5,"I just moved here at the beginning of the month and Athena was the closest salon.  It was really nice on the inside, and I was given a full tour of the spa by Oliver.  Very upscale and good quality.  It is unassuming in appearance from the outside, but  luxury on the inside.\n\nI received a cut and color which was about 2 hours to complete in full.  I was looking for that, so it made me pretty happy.  After living in Southern CA, I think the prices here are about the same if not more reasonable than they were in OC.  It's not cheap, but then I expect to pay more to get a good hairstyle that I like.   I think I have found a keeper here!"
5,3 ladies came with a field supervisor. They were scheduled for 10 am and they were there perfectly on time. I walked the house with the supervisor and showed them what I wanted cleaned. Let me tell you they went above and beyond and scrubbed my entire house! It's never been cleaner! They were thorough  but did not waste any time. I would highly recommend Pristine Cleaning to anyone.
5,"This is my favorite PetSmart store in the entire Las Vegas Valley.  Why?  Well, for one the staff is always helpful and nice.  My boyfriend and I got our Rats Cyrus and Adelle from here since they were a female pet store.  Adelle's temperament wasn't exactly a kind one so we ended up giving her back to the store and got Dawn.  These two rats together were so sweet together.  Unfortunately, Cyrus contracted a disease and left us to be with other rats in heaven.  Now, it's just Dawn and us.  We figured to just keep her without any other rats in case she had the disease too.\n\nAnyway, we didn't know how to raise rats and didn't really know what to do with them.  Luckily, there was a young female clerk who knew a lot about small animals and gave us all the knowledge we now know.  She was so helpful and took the time with patience to explain how to be parents of rats.\n\nAlso, everyone seems to be happy working here every time we're here to get our doggy and ratty stuff."
5,"excellent offbeat sandwiches and original home made soup.\n\ni never thought cream cheese could be used in so many different ways, with so many different accompanying flavors. i was VERY skeptical when i first saw the menu, but have been more than satisfied with everything i've ever ordered here.\n\nthere is a great backyard patio which is open during the summers. best of all, this place is a stone's through from the mountain, and we all know that nature + tasty sandwich = best thing ever."
5,"Fantastic ambiance and food, I'm excited to have this place in my neighborhood....it feels like you live in a real city"
5,"Perfect place for a good bite after a long night!\n\nDrinks are good food is always good and fresh, yes it's identical to cheesecake factory and who doesn't love that!\n\nHad a delishh pizza with wild mushrooms and asparagus with their house salad which was delightful!"
5,This place is amazing!!  Best pizza in town!  Staff is super friendly and food comes out fast.  Owner is fantastic and makes sure everyone is happy.  Cannot say enough about this place.  Take-out is just as good as when I'm at the restaurant.
5,"MEATBALLS- they are so worth the hour roundtrip drive for me.  The price is cheap and the food quality is spectacular!  The cafeteria is clean, well lit, tastefully decorated, filled with character, and efficiently designed.  \n\nIkea has a brilliant business plan and I am very impressed by the execution of their customer service in both the cafeteria and marketplace.  The workers are always eager to help with genuine smiles smeared on their faces.  This place is a shopping/eating play land!  Ikea takes care of your kids, saves the environment (by not providing plastic bags at checkout), and nurtures your creative side.\n\nRemember to bring your own bags for your purchased goods as well as try some of their infamous meatballs with cranberry sauce!"
5,"I have used Lauren several over the past couple of years.  She is a true professional and a genuine pleasure to work with.  She listens to what you want and does a beautiful job to accommodate your needs.  I highly recommend her, as she is a personal favorite MUA of mine!"
5,"Gorgeous! Very high end beach club. It's Vegas so you know the drinks at the clubs will be through the roof. Now if you want to have a quick meal here, enjoy splurging 15-20 bucks on salads and such. It was too rich for my blood, so I had to pass on the food. Beautiful decor all around. The water is a glistening ocean blue and the security is tight. Let's say we girls had too much fun dancing on those poles with water trickling down our faces and such, but fellas...no pole dancing for you! Once you place your limbs on to the pole dancing area, you are swept off in a millisecond. Haha I have no complaints about the club, the only one is that I wasn't able to see ZEDD because he was out \""sick\"" according to the staff."
5,"Best subs, period! Although it is almost always busy (even when I go at night), it is worth the wait. Affordable and fast service as well!"
5,"Fabulous bar!! Cosy with sofa areas and service fantastic! Gets very busy on a Saturday so if you fancy a quiet drink, go when it opens during the week or on a sunday after a stroll or shopping!"
5,"My favorite hotel in Vegas, and probably one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in, period.  They often run great deals on the standard suites, which are awesome.  Remote controlled shades and curtains on the windows; separate sitting rooms; deliriously comfortable beds; two sinks in the bathroom; and (best of all) luxuriously deep soaking tubs.\n\nThe casino is nice, but the shopping and food are nicer.  Lots of great stuff at the Grand Canal shops -- a personal favorite is Basin White, which sells awesome bath products.  Buy a couple of bath bombs there, and take advantage of the soaking tub!  For food, try brunch at Bouchon by the 10th floor pool.  For quicker breakfast to go, try chocolate croissants at the Bouchon Bakery near the hotel elevators.  For dinner, try Canaletto (get the roasted pear ravioli) or Postrio (by Wolfgang Puck -- try the meatloaf)."
5,Absolutely amazing food! This place has great customer service and is a great place to eat! Definitely try the Eggs Benedict or Loco Moco!
5,"This place is AMAZING! Not only do they have great food but INCREDIBLE customer service! I made a reservation for 11 people and as soon as we walked in we were seated right away, not all of our party came in at the same time but we were still seated. Some places u have to wait until your party arrives. Food came to our table so quick! They were all very attentive, empty plates were taken as soon as it's cleared, they asked if there's anything we would like to order. This is WONDERFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE. Very impressed! Scott remembered us from our previous visit and that's very rare. Price is very reasonable. By far the best AYCE Sushi in town! And I'm very impressed with decor, atmosphere, and they played good upbeat music! Very modern!"
5,"Went in to HTC - Tempe abouta a month ago with my roommate, and since they had a promotion for $10 piercings, we decided (on a whim) to get piercings.  I had my top ear pierced, and she had her belly-button done.\n\nHonestly, I was really scared, but once we went in to get our piercings done, the staff was super friendly and explained everything there was to know about the quality of earrings and other materials they used.  To sum all the info they gave us, they use top quality metal for all their piercings.\n\nOnce we went in with the piercer, I was fearing for my life, but he was super friendly, explained everything and he got to know us.  He stuck a needle through my ear, and I had a totally painless and pleasant experience that I really wanted to get another piercing.  Definitely a great place, and a chill atmosphere, not to mention their staff is knowledgeable :D"
5,"It's been a long time since I came to Carlos and Pepe's and boy has it changed. I went upstairs to the bar for a quick bite before the Habs game and was shocked how beautiful the place was. The waiter told me they had just renovated and installed a new menu. I had the grilled chicken quesadillas and they were fantastic. Lots of beer choices now as well. wish I had more time, but will definitely be back."
5,"I wish I could fly them to every treatment at MD Anderson.  They are friendly and on time.  If the tickets were better priced at united, I would never get on another Spirit airplane!!!  Spirit sucks and the people aren't real friendly!!!"
5,"This quaint little restaurant (only 8-10 tables) has excellent food & service.  We chose this restaurant based upon reviews from the internet, and I think it lived up to the hype.  We visited Montreal for 4 days, and this was our favorite dining experience there.  We had the chicken heart pate as an appetizer. braised pork belly, & duck ravioli.  All were excellent.  Definitely recommended!"
5,"2 wonderfully concocted cocktails.  The  Buffalo Wing lollipops. A chopped vegetable salad that only Puck can perfect, and another salad made of housemade burrata fresh mozz, baby arugula, shaved fennel, high end grapes, proscuito parma, and balsamic drizzle. And then the housemade italian sausage, black olive pizza cooked crisp.  Friendly effecient service by Bernard.  A friendly visit by Executive Chef, Eric Klein.  Another glorious dining experience at Spago friends"
5,"Great little hidden-in-plain-sight lounge, great for an early morning coffee, which transforms into an adorable piano bar late at night!  Who knew?  Not many people, quite frankly, and let's keep it that way.  Just between us, if you are not interested in the usual Vegas scene, and want a place to just chill, this is the place for you."
5,we drove from cornelius to charlotte to try Flying biscuit as there are so few breakfast options in Lake Norman area. Wow worth the drive. most amazing biscuits and gravy EVER (chicken gravy)- delish. Everything was good. Worth driving for a memorable meal-
5,"Bet Thai Iced Tea and Coffee anywhere! Great food, too! We always stop in whenever we are in Vegas. Service is excellent, prices are good."
5,"Easily my favorite local place to eat!!! I order the same thing every time because it's SO good that I just can't get myself to venture away from it. It's the Local DIsh Burger & it is to die for!!!! The burger is cooked to perfection, then it's topped with pimiento cheese, thick crispy bacon, and spinach and served on a pretzel roll. OMG, it makes my mouth water thinking about it!!! I've also tried (because other people have ordered it :-) ) the chicken & waffles (YUM!), the chicken wings (which, according to my daughter, are the BEST in town - and she would know!!!), the Pulled Pork BBQ sandwich (awesome), and the cheese fondue (SO good, but could use more toast points with it!) \n\nSo happy to have such a wonderful place to eat in Fort Mill. I would much rather stay local & support local than driving uptown. I can't recommend Local Dish highly enough!!! Incredible fresh food, fast & friendly service, & a homey atmosphere.\n\nHeading there for lunch today!!"
5,Love going to Peachwave! Yogurt is delicious and lots of toppings! Customer service is great. I love going and trying all the different favors!
5,"I love burgers. Even got a list dedicated solely to my pursuit of the perfect burger.  Did Burger Bar crack my top three? Not quite but they do make one hell of a burger. I also appreciate the different 'fries' options - skinny, sweet potato, steak and onion rings. The sweet potato were good but pale in comparison to the onion rings. Oh, the onion rings. I can't wait for the SF outlet of Burger bar to open so I can get some of your crunchy goodness on a weekly basis."
5,"Got the Marino Sandwich and Bob's Favorite.  Okay, my first time here.  Delicious.  I'll be back.  Stopped here on a whim.  Had read about it, never could find it.  It's a do over."
5,Really good thin crust pizza. Everything is fresh and it's not super greasy. Their salads are also good too. This place does get pretty busy on Friday and Saturday nights but you can always order pizza to go in advance.
5,"How is it that one gym can possess all the greatest trainers in the known universe? I am baffled by it. The trainers that run this gym are fantastic. They are upbeat and positive, while still being genuine. In that they don't annoy the crap out of you with the normal personal trainer BS. Just that fake, inattentive, jargon that you can get out of a workout DVD.\n\nYou are being personally trained. The trainers actually take the time to learn your name. They watch you and somehow keep track of everyone in the class, your strengths and weaknesses. If you go often enough they certainly remember your level between classes. They constantly encourage your strengths so you know what you are doing right. They also remind you of what you do wrong, but in a very courteous, straight-to-the-point, non-judgmental way. I love that they aren't afraid to correct you.\n\nYou are getting personally trained at a bargain price of around $3-$7 a class. Plus they don't focus on you constantly so you don't get performance anxiety! That's why personal training doesn't work (too much attention for too short of a time... in this class you get attention in short bursts).This is the perfect workout class mostly because of the trainers. But the simple gym setup, music and atmosphere are also all perfect. I hope to get into more advanced MMA training, but I think I will always keep a membership here, due to the friendly atmosphere and endlessly challenging but fun workouts."
5,"We here for my first time yesterday with my mother who has been several times and has nothing but good things to say. \n\n1. SERVICE - everyone is extremely friendly and helpful, down to the super friendly valet! \n\n2. The facility and grounds were so clean and smelled amazing. Great clean up crew :) \n\n3. The rooftop pool was AMAZING. The pool was not overly chlorinated and it felt like there was water softener which made it so nice to swim in. \n\n4. The whole experience was quiet and relaxing and my masseuse with Linda was great. She was friendly, considerate, and STRONG. :)"
5,"Amazing! We have been going here for 7+ yrs and have never had a bad experience. My daughter (who is 6) choose this as her birthday meal this year. The food is amazing. We've had the chicken, pork belly, bulgolgi and Kalbi and they were all awesome. My ex introduced me to this place and he didn't time in Korea with the Army and I this is his favorite place in az to go to four Korean. The sushi is pretty good too. Richard, the owner is so nice and the staff is amazing as well. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone in the mood for good Korean or sushi!"
5,"So happy i found this shop. I only got a touch up but freak did an amazing job. He cleaned my pepsi logo so good. My lines were weak n broken and color was almost see through and he packed in so much color and made my out lines real crisp. I wish I went to him for the tattoo originally . I will go back for sure to get my other one touched up and to get a brand new one. The shop was clean, real professional. I've already recommended the shop to two people so far and will tell more people when I go back to work."
5,"I promised to go here And I did. Went for the fish tacos, my sister got the Flautas we shared and it was absolutely excellent! The flautas were cooked perfectly & complete with top notch guacamole. Rice and Beans rocked & The fish tacos were great too, fish was mouth watering and I loved the way they chopped the cabbage. Oh BTW to the poor dunce with the one one star review, (fish tacos traditionally come with cabbage so your \""trip around the world\"" obviously didnt include Tijuana). Frank was an absolute pleasure and has definitely won the hearts of myself and my family! See you soon!"
5,We've eaten here many times and definitely prefer it over the Samurai Sam's across the street. They are always so friendly and the food is fresh and yummy.
5,"Gotta say it's one of the better chain restaurants around in the valley!\n\nAmerican-Italian pizzas and pastas sounds pretty simple, but Oregano's is one of those places that's a must try.  With several locations from Scottsdale, Tempe, Chandler, and even Tucson; you really don't have much reason not to go!  \n\nThis time around I ordered the Clark St. Meat pizza along with trying out my friends anti-pasto salad.  Again, simple, but tasty.  The salami, peppercini pepper, and parmesan cheese on the salad was very light and not over powering with dressing like most places.  The pizza I ordered thin crust and yes the crust was perfectly toasted and not soggy as I would expect with all the meat ingredients atop.  Tad bit of spice and no need to add more peppers to heat it up - yum!  \n\nOverall, food was great and service is very good.  Well trained staff members, courtesy and attentive - A plus in my book! Enjoy!"
5,"This place was quite good! We went for breakfast and I ordered a mushroom and spinach omelet with potatoes, with the most amazing rosemary creme frishe (sp?). yuuummmmyy!!! My bf ordered one of the big burgers on the menu and said it was very moist but a little bland. The fries sweet potato fries were so good, especially with the creme frishe."
5,"Love this place!  I've been many times for both breakfast and lunch (b-fast is my fav!) and love it every time.  The manager (or maybe owner?) is a super nice guy, very welcoming, kind, helpful.  Back when it was Two Hippies, I asked if they had iced coffee.  Even though they didn't, he made me my own iced version!  Food is delish and I love the location.  The ambiance is fun!"
5,I go here all the time it is absolutly awsome! California burrito has to be the best thing on the menu.
5,I love this place.  I usually order from here once or twice a week.  I'm a Pho addict and my boyfriend loves the sesame chicken.  We often dine in too as the decor and decorations are interesting.  It's a very comfy and intimate feeling dining in and/or on their patio in the cooler months.\n\nI've eaten a lot of Pho from other restaurants around the valley and Tottie's is in my top two! :)
5,If you plan on attending a Pirate game be sure to park in one of the parking garages in town and walk across the Roberto Clemente Bridge. The bridge closes to vehicle traffic on game days for pedestrians only.  A statue of Clemente is adjacent to the bridge as you enter to ballpark. The bridge has a great photo opportunity. Enjoy the game!!!
5,"Sunday night prime rib special is amazing!  Comes with salad, side dish, and dessert!  This prime rib was the best I think I have had!  Usually when you order it rare to mid rare it can be a little tough or chewy, but this prime rib melted in my mouth!  There were four of us, we all ordered the same special with different sides so we all could share...highly recommend it!"
5,"I called four tree service places to get bids for removing a very large mesquite in our backyard. Conrad from Chip Off the Old Block came early the next day to give his estimate. He was courteous and recommended that as I got my other bids, to make sure that each company was fully insured as his was.\n\nHis bid came in the lowest and he truly worked to get my business (without being forceful). So I agreed and within two days his company's crew came and took down this wildly overgrown tree within three hours. I was amazed at how they were able to scale the branches and bring down large sections of the tree without damaging the numerous plants that surrounded the mesquite tree.\n\nI was extremely pleased with all of their work, including the stump grinding. Everything about this company was professional, especially their timing. They were never late and their communication throughout the process was top-notch.\n\nClean-up was excellent. I recommend Chip Off the Old Block without any hesitation."
5,"I love to see a couple of folks take the initiative and turn something that was a dilapidated eye sore into the next neighborhood staple.  what used to be the best place to buy a possibly used comb, some nylons, and a five year old can of spam has become my favorite place to grab a sandwich.\n\ni am starting to work my way through the regular menu and can testify that they caprese and \""ham and cheese\"" are insanely delicious.  i say \""ham and cheese\"" because it is actually proscuitto and fresh mozzarella.\n\nif you \""like\"" the noda bodega on the faceyspace, you get a pic of their daily special popping up in your feed to make you hungry (get it, feed, hungry?).\n\ntheir beer selection is small, but nice with plenty of craft and microbrews in there (even a gluten free option or two).  their wine selection is inexpensive and tasty.  they also stock fun non-alcoholic beverage accompanyment.\n\nand as the summer starts to heat up, i am sure they will have trouble keeping their ice cream freezer full.  ben, jerry, bryer, snicker, all sorts of frozen treats.\n\ni will definitely be dropping by on a regular basis..."
5,"My husband and I visited because we have never eaten Vietnamese food before. The staff was amazing! We met the chef, had Beef Pho and Shrimp Spring Rolls, everything was delicious and fresh. We will definitely be back!"
5,"Great tasting and inexpensive vegan donuts and related pastries.\n\nThe top two shelves are dairy- and egg-free. Some of the donuts on the bottom shelf are made with animal products. Cash only.\n\nIt'd be better if there were signs to help you identify the products, or at least some indication of which ones are vegetarian."
5,"Delicious food, amazing staff, good price. I came here for the buffet and found out they had mango lassi on tap! This place is a gold mine, by far best punjabi style Indian buffet in all of az. Will definitely be back again!"
5,"This is officially my favorite place to eat, my bf and I go every Saturday!\nOrange chicken. Hong Kong soup. Eggplant pork. Try anything- it is all good! \n\nThe owners are amazing, Diane (hopefully I spelled her name right! D:) always makes us feel right at home and normally grabs my bf his coke before we even have to ask! \n\nBesides the staff (who we love dearly!) the food is incredible. I only give five stars to restaurants where I can close my eyes and pick something random off the menu. Everything I have had at Simi's has been perfect!"
5,"I happened to just come upon this bakery!\nLocated in a little building that was once a Doctor Office from the 40's/\nThat alone I found to be very cool.\nButtermilk Pie!   OMG... I have never tried anything like this.\nThe girl working gave me a sample with a caramel sauce on top.\nIt was truly fantastic.\nSo I got 2 slices to go. The good thing you do not have to buy an entire pie. Though you can if you would like to.\nOh yes, we all loved it. She put the caramel sauce on the side in a container.\n\nI also bought some little Peanut Butter Dog treats with no chemicals or anything else in it. All natural. Our little dog loved them. She tap dances around till she gets one.\nIt is a great place, with some wonderful baked items.\nThey make some wonderful cakes and other items.  What a great local place."
5,"The owner is also the hostess, waitress, cook & bartender!!!  Now that is pretty amazing by itself.  I tried the craziest thing on the menu that I could find, stewed goat with smashed yam and casava leaves.  After the meal Esther laughed and said she had \""never seen a caucasian eat all her food before.\""  \n\nShe was great and makes a mean rum drink too.  The neighborhood is bit dicey at night, but hey, live a little.  Watching her work so hard made me appreciate my desk job even more.  \n\nAfter the meal and in the parking lot, she actually said I tipped her \""TOO MUCH\"" and tried to give me some money back!!!  I told her she was worth every penny and with all the jobs she was doing I wish it was more.  Really great and I will try to support this little business as much as I can.  The food may be too exotic for some of you but give it a try."
5,We came here because tofu hut was full and my bf wanted BBQ. I am surprise how amazing the service was. Our server is always walking around to see if the tables needed help. When our food came she even help us start cooking it and would come back from time to time to help turn the food and cut them into small pieces. Excellent service and the food was good.
5,"No wait time, I was in and out in 10 minutes. Price is reasonable as well, I paid $15 for standard 10 prints card. Staff was very polite and knowledgeable. I also appreciated her gentle touch when she rolled my fingers. Ample parking & super close to UNLV. I'll be back when I'm done with my nursing school."
5,"My goodness, I have missed you.  We headed to Madison for our 1st anniversary and since we booked the hotel I was trying to get my hands on a large cooler so I could stock up on my loved and very missed items at Trader Joe's.  Thank you husbands coworker for the mighty fine cooler you provided!  \n\nThis is a particularly nice and well stocked Trader Joe's!  The parking, as everyone claims, truly is a bit of a pain in the ass - oh well, parking at the one I frequented in Chicago was a bigger pain in the ass.   The staff here is just as nice as any other TJ's, maybe a little nicer.  I was surprised by how well stocked everything was considering how busy it was and that it was a Sunday morning.   We walked out of here with $180 worth of deliciousness and we have now decided to purchase a deep freezer - well, we've been wanting to for quite some time, but this little trip and 1st time trip for my husband really helped seal the deal I think - and make a trip from good ol' Wausau every other month or so.  \n\nMy god I've missed this place."
5,"Soup dumplings in Pittsburgh.   I'm still trying to get my head around it.\n\nThey are still in soft-opening phase, we went for their second day of lunch service.  Much more organized than most places at this stage - we had good service although the place filled quickly.\n\nSoup dumplings were very good, temperature and texture just right.  Hand-pulled noodle soup with wontons was excellent - the noodles stand up against some we had recently in Hong Kong.  Green onion pancake was great - chewy and with the perfect inside texture and salty oniony goodness.\n\nHot tea was kept filled and hot throughout our visit - something I've wished for in Pittsburgh forever.  \n\nOverall, super.  Can't wait to go back."
5,"Seriously loved this place. (\""Love\"", actually, since I'm still here. Great food, gluten free options, very friendly. Hope they can make a go of it. The house salad had a wonderful variety of flavorful, fresh greens. The Rigatoni Salsiccia and the Penne Genovese were great."
5,A friend referred me and I love this place...\nGreat service Great food.... The chef is amazing... The food is fresh and served to order.... If I was rich I would personally hire the chef as my personal chef so I can personally eat her cooking everyday.... This is definitely my fav spot so far... I highly recommend it....
5,"Delightful intimate space with superb service and delicious food to back it up.  \n\nCame here desiring a solid bowl of pasta and got that plus a to-die-for risotto starter and a spectacular vegetable terrine.  Drinks were excellent, too (I was treated to a refreshing take on a Pimm's Cup).\n\nAlthough we were without a reservation, we were accommodated with no hassle.  Overall, visit this place!  Go if you like low key, intimate settings where the focus is on the food first."
5,I had RoadRunner delivery from there. I always really enjoy their rolls. Especially the Japanese lasagna. It's the best I've had!
5,Hands Down.... BEST Indian food and restaurant in PHX!! Better than old Bombay Spice!!! Lamb Chops to die for! Lamb vindaloo spicy and savory and chicken masala second to none! Must Try!!!!
5,Extremely helpful!  My coolant was leaking out and one of the manager Edward Gomez took the time to look at my car and no doubt he found exactly where the leak is. They did not have the part and i needed to get it ASAP. He gave me information of where they might have it in stock. He went above and beyond helping me out knowing that I am not buying anything from there. I am thankful and appreciate what he did.
5,"I've been going to Super-Cuts and Great Clips pretty much my whole life, and the experiences have been more or less variable. I wanted to find a place that had people that actually took time and some sort of passion in working with their customers instead of attempting to empty the chair in less than 10 minutes (like most chain places). I must say this place has won me over. Every piece of equipment that is used is top notch and done with precision and care. If you're looking for a place for quality cuts, check this place out! Ask for E-Z"
5,"Stayed here in June because of the central location, price & what they offer.  Would return to stay here again during future Montreal visits. Great for couples & families (if only because of the large rooms).\n\nHad no issues whatsoever, very clean & good service whenever needed. GREAT city rooftop with lounge chairs for a summer evening. BIG rooms with fully stocked kitchen. Free WI-FI. Fitness centre small (2 treadmills, couple of bikes, small weight room) but does the job. Indoor pool was smallish & usually full with kids. Complimentary continental breakfast spread was pretty decent (fruit, oatmeal, toast, bagels, etc). For a better breakfast, Eggspectations is a 10 minute or less walk away on St Catherine Street. Don't miss the Italian restaurant a few doors down, fantastic pizza!"
5,"Bday eat fest continued....boy, where to begin;  how about the \""nom nom wings\"".  O.M.G!!  They absolutely were the BOMB!  They tasted like cocheechong (you Koreans know what time it is when it come to that flavor, out of sight!!).  Then my wife took a bite of her Kalbi burger and her eyes rolled to the back of head; I thought oh know (wink wink) but I knew we had a winner, but wasn't expecting this\"" \""this is the BEST burger I've ever had\"". I took a bite and cried a little I think cause it was sooo good\""!  If you've not been you've got to try this joint!!"
5,A must stop for spring training fans. Always make it a point to come here on our yearly trip.  They're known for their ribs but i havent had anything on the menu i didt like. Love the ambiance with all the sports memorabilia everywhere.
5,"I was referred to this shop by my running group and I thought it was like any other store..and I was very wrong. The moment I stepped in, their service, approach and listening to my problems with foot was great. I have had lot of issues with blisters and they have been very helpful for giving solutions and trying different things to ease my pain.Joe, Flash and Karen have been very helpful and I highly recommend this store for any running/walking needs."
5,All I know is. The Hubs and I were hungry so I yelped a burger joint in PHX. I was all Bae this place has 254 reviews .. Let's go there ! We were in PHX from Prescott for the day. Got the Teriyaki Burger Rocket size and fries ! delishioursh ! Hit The Spot ! The owner even chased us to the parking lot to make sure we enjoyed our Food  Yay!!!!!
5,"Great school. ASU truly strives to be a world-class university, and they are really serious about being a leader in \""the technology of tomorrow,\"" especially in biotechnology. While not strictly a tech school, I wouldn't be surprised if ASU was directly involved in the transhumanism movement that is already upon us."
5,"The waitress was nice. It was very quiet as they just recently opened and it's in the back of the parking structure. The food came out quick. Portions are small so keep that in mind while ordering . Watch out for the spice !!! Woo it can be hot if you ask for it. I had the chicken curry, garlic naan and some samosas , samosas were the best"
5,"Keeping this short but (hopefully) sweet. The best show I've seen in Vegas - and I've been to many. This is more musical tribute than true Cirque experience as it's not as over the top in tumbling, acrobatics etc but it more than makes up for it in sheer nostalgia and entertainment value. \n\nYou don't have to be an ardent MJ fan to love this show. In fact, I'm inclined to believe that the more marginal the fan, the more overwhelming the show is. You simply forget the sheer number of hits he had. The catalog is astounding. \n\nOne tip, don't sit in the front, sit toward the back middle or better, row AA of section 2. So much going on all over you won't have to strain your neck turning around.\n\nSimply amazing."
5,"Still loving this place, nothing's changed there. I've become obsessed with their Hefewiezen, especially in the hot summer months. And still haven't touched a Kiltlifter in several years. And their menu has become one of my favorite bar menus in the entire Valley. Always delicious, quality eats that satisfy any hungry beer drinker.\nIn fact, I love their Hefewiezen and Carne Asada so much, that I served it at my wedding. Think I'm kidding? I am not. Well, actually, I couldn't get their Hefewiezen because they don't do small kegs, only college frat party size kegs and that would have been far too much beer. But we sure did serve that Carne Asada (they forgot the tortillas, dammit). and the guests raved about it all night. Nice work, Four Peaks!"
5,"There is nothing negative about this place. The food is delish! The presentation is too beautiful to eat. Service is amazing! Ambient is great! And best of all, it is affordable for the quality you get.\nThis gem is definitely my go-to place whenever I wanna take my friends out for brunch. We ordered a 2 breakfast burros: one regular and one with chorizo - delish'! Got some complimentary chipotle popcorn to try while waiting for our food. As we were finishing up our crepes, the server came out with a plate of rose marshmallows and a torch. He roasted the marshmallows right in front of our eyes and left after saying \""It's on the house. Enjoy guys! ;)\"" I also checked in on Yelp and got my delicious lemongrass tea for free. \nIt is my second time here and it's just getting better everytime. Love it!"
5,"Friday afternoon lunch time and the place was full.  We waited for a spot at the bar and soon discovered that we were one of the few in the place that were not regulars.  It was like Cheers, they knew what people wanted before they even sat down.  Soon we were made to feel like family.  We ordered frites, dh had the V burger and I had the Avocado BLT (we both had a few beers as well...peche lambic and dh has a few different ones).  When the food came the bartender remembered that DH ordered his burger medium (when the burger comes from a farm like Fountain Prairie Farms you can do that!) and saw that it was more med well and offered to take it back.  When he said he would eat it, the bartender went right to the window to tell them to make sure they watched the product.  \n\nWhat could be better...Belgian taps, amazing dry aged burger, Nueske bacon and organic greens.  Thank you Brasserie V!!!"
5,"I love Mac's!  I am there every Wednesday night for bike night with the other 100+ bikers!  Very fun environment, it is noisy but with as many fans are trying to pack into the place it is understandable.  The BBQ is great, the beer selection is unheard of, and the mac and cheese is to die for!  Nothing like hearing a big burly biker order a side of mac and cheese! ;)\n\n5 stars!!!!"
5,"I can't complain about Aloha Specialties..they serve down home delicious Hawaiian food at reasonable prices. Oh, and HUGE portions. I always seem to go during peak hours so the line to order is often out the door, but there's so many menu items that it takes a while to decide what you want. Even when its packed, the service is great and you'll get your food in no time. They are cash only, which is fine, just hit up one of the 10,000 ATMs in downtown. Some of the food may be a little questionable (Fried saimin, actually regular saimin that looks like it was fried for a few seconds & the poke which is drowned in shoyu) but I stick with what I know- Teri cheeseburger & a small saimin. I need my combo fix of that since Washington Saimin closed down in Honolulu.. :("
5,"The food is healthy, filling, and vegetarian/vegan friendly.  They can cater to gluten free as well.   I enjoy the vegetarian spins on popular sandwiches (e.g the Melvin instead of a Reuben).  The owner goes out of his way to introduce himself and offer samples of new menu items.  The staff are often very busy, but will smile and accommodate your concerns/questions/requests."
5,"Dr. Crow is a pro! I was so scared! I was in so much pain. I tried to just deal with it. I tried to pray it away. I tried warm water with salt. Nope, I need a root canal. I was literally sweating.\n\nI swear it didn't hurt at all. Lol. What a chicken I was. Dr Crow was nice. Patient. He had a couple corny jokes but they helped.\n\nI'm actually in the waiting room with my son. I'm kinda laughing because I know Erhart he's thinking."
5,"Excellent people to do business with. We were referred to them from another Boulder City business and they did everything they said they would!  We needed work on a boat trailer and they were very helpful and knew what they were talking about, which can be rare these days. Would have no problem going back to them."
5,"A few years back I moved into a flat that hadn't yet had a shower fitted, and since I tend to view a bath as effectively sitting in your own lukewarm, putrid filth for half an hour, a challenging dilemma arose. Either go back to my mum's every day for a scrub, or grow steadily more revolting and tramplike each day until our pot-smoking cowboy of a plumber decided to finally turn up for his shift.\n\nThankfully, Poundstretcher had the solution, for the princely sum of 3 notes. A shower head that plugged into the bath faucet. \""More powerful than an electric shower\"" it said on the box, and dreams of a cleansing like never before drifted into my thoughts. Maybe I wouldn't even need that drug ravaged plumber, it all seemed to good to be true.\n\nAnd it was. On the very rare occasion that the connector didn't immediatelty pop out from the tap, the pressure of the water was roughly equivalent to the trickle down Grandad's leg after his third sherry at Christmas. I was, quite literally trying to wash myself with a leaky tap.\n\nJust for those few days of excitement, when I thought a few quid had solved all my life's ills, I will always love Poundie's. The kings of worthless tat."
5,"Where do I begin this was so amazing. Things I highly recommend:\n-the hot crab legs \n-clam chowder with bacon\n-scallops in the shell with spinach & Panko crumbs! Mmmm\n-Alaskan cod served over some yummy mash something- so good\n\n-mushroom ricotta pizza \n-polenta with beef cheek & much room-sooo good\n\n-cream cheese wontons!\n-good sushi-pretty basic rolls but high quality & fresh \n\n-mexican style corn with mayo,chile & butter\n\nI had to stop to save room for dessert, but some things I wanted to try were stuffed baked potato & Mac n cheese\n\nDessert:\n-creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e- perfect!!!\n-made-to-order crepe, I topped mine with bananas in caramel sauce, nutella & whip cream- so delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n-flan\n\nOh & the atmosphere is beautiful!"
5,Mix is actually a restaurant that turns into a lounge/ club at 10pm. It's located on the top floor of TheHotel at Mandalay Bay. Since it's basically a roof top bar/restaurant the view is amazing. You have the option to either sit in our outside on huge comfy couches while taking in the view. The drinks are strong and delicious. They start off around $16 a piece. Try the Violet. The decor is sophisticated and trendy. The music is the latest and the club is always packed. Mix is a definite must see.
5,Taco Bell is amazing. The smothered burrito is the best thing they've ever had and it's only $3 for a beef one! I always get extra chipotle sauce in mine and just one fills me up. \nTheir other stuff is great too and the menu is always rotating. This location normally even asks if I want sauce in the drive thru. That's great because a lot of places don't which isn't fun. \nAnother awesome thing you'll find at Taco Bell is Mt Dew Baja Blast. It's probably the best Mt Dew out there. The mt dew AM is good too (it's OJ and Mt Dew).\nI eat here at least once a week because the food is awesome and cheap.
5,"Owner Mr.Kim is bomb!\nHe had mighty hand for fix any kind of cellphone.\nExcellent service and superfast work!\nAnd also lowest price in Las Vegas!\nI'm leave in LA but if i have problem w/ my cell phone?\nAlway go to Premier telecome, Even if in LV.\nThis is my best choice in my life!\nLOVE YOU MR. KIM!"
5,"I have been an avid movie goer for about 15 years. I have never looked forward to sitting for 2 hours in those tiny, uncomfortable chairs. When I heard about the galaxy theater opening I was stoked! What a concept!\n\nI have ONLY come to this theater since it opened anytime I go see a movie. The chairs! They are comfortable, roomy, and have a small mobile tray for food and drinks. They do serve alcohol (I'm not a big drinker) and most of my friends love getting a beer and relaxing while watching a movie. What else can be said? \n\nWell, Saturday my hubby and my family went to see Captain America and I didn't have a chance to eat dinner beforehand. I ordered a bratwurst, large soda, and small popcorn. Being the concession stand is how a theater actually makes their money, it wasn't cheap ($19). However, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the brat. They have 4 different types of dogs to choose from (cheese jalape\u00f1o, brat, beef dog, and one other), and actual toppings to put on it such as sauerkraut, lettuce, cheese, a pickle, etc. It was more than I expected when I ordered it for sure.\n\nGreat experience every time we come here. If you bring your ticket stub to the yogurt shop next door, they give you a little baby discount, fyi. Regular theaters pale in comparison."
5,"Dr Scafidi is an exceptional chiropractor. I went in for a visit 2 weeks ago. Having gone to so many chiropractors in my life, I know the difference when a chiro knows what he is doing and when he doesn't. I have a scoliosis that throws everything off on me. \nHe definitely understands the implications of what a scoliosis does to a person.\nAfter the adjustment, all the tissue work, and pressure points that he worked, I have less migraines, less aches now. I also noticed that I am sleeping a lot more at night, more than the usual 4 or 5 hours that I was doing before his work. I think that many of my aches and pains kept me up at night.\nI will be returning here because I am getting the help here."
5,"While on the way to Moab in my off road jeep, I noticed a serious steering malfunction.  TJ took me right in and fixed the problem.  Randy, one of Kincade's mechanics who worked on my jeep,  also lubricated all of the grease fittings on my highly modified vehicle.  He found a couple of fittings that required the rear drive shaft to be dropped and did those as well.  This level of diligence saved me from a mechanical failure while rock crawling.\n\nNot only are these guys great mechanics, they were very polite.  Also their office and shop facilities were very clean.\n\nIf I lived in Phoenix, I would take all my vehicles to Kincade's for maintenance and repair work.  Thx again, TJ and Randy!"
5,"Always great food service, omg the Beer menu is great they have it if you want pretty much. I love them.."
5,All the people here are super nice. I really enjoy to have meal here. The price is  also really reasonable. Every dollar you spent here worth more then it.\nI would like to go there with my friends next time.
5,"I am really excited about this place! Even better than Lotus of Siam. The pad thai and tom yum were delicious, there were tons of vegan and vegetartian options, and the service was fast, friendly and personal: the staff even remembered my friend that hadn't been in since January!  Hands down, best thai food in Vegas."
5,"Just so happened to be in the 'hood on Sunday afternoon, dropping my  oldest daughter off at a friend's house. \n\nWell, well, well, there's Poliberto's, and I have my partner in crime with me, my baby, closer to 11 now than 10 !  Here's my chance- I rarely order fries for myself unless I have \""someone\"" to share them with.  Let's pull on in, shall we, for, ummm... dinner ruining snack?  Early dinner?  You decide, but we're gettin' some Carne Asada fries today!\n\nO.M.G.\n\nAnd my friends, I have moved my rating up to a 5.\n\nMy daughter opened them in the car.  We picked at them a little.  We liked.  \n\nAt the base of this massive mound of food are fries, cooked 'til crunchy.  They are seasoned well.  They are topped with a big ol' pile of cheese and massive quantities of carne asada.  Adding to the party, they are doused with sour cream and guacamole.  \n\nShe found the forks.  We picked at them some more.  We joked about not having any when we got home.  We talked about going back for another container.\n\nI'd say we killed about 1/3 of these evil morsels by the time we got home."
5,"This place is so good!\n\nEverything we got was sooo fresh tasting and well-seasoned that I am day dreaming about eating the leftovers for lunch right now!\n\nWe started with the spring rolls and wonton egg drop soup, both of which were delightful!  For the main dishes we got basil tofu, Singapore noodles and eggplant tofu. I was really impressed by all, but especially the Singapore noodles, which were not greasy or dry and expertly seasoned. The shrimp in them were not over cooked or rubbery at all. \n\nSo surprised by the quality of the food from a Chinese takeout/delivery place!"
5,"This place is definitely one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. Whenever visitors come, i tell them they should stop by this place. In fact, we went this past Saturday and had the stuffed dates, the Machengo mac and cheese, the ceviche, 2 orders of the sliders, the chicken skewers, and the mussels. There was a pitcher of Sangria as well as several other desserts. Oh and somehow we fit in banana-nutella sandwiches, chocolate bread pudding and lemon berry tarts. Everyone loved everything. This is no joke. I do not lie about food lol. For 6 adults, this was sooo filling and our bill was about $120."
5,"My office just moved into Tivoli Village this weekend so I've eaten at this place 3 times in the last week. Each time the food had been great and my husband loved the cheap beer on tap after a long day of moving. \n\nWe've had the chicken club pizza a couple times and it is just awesome, the toppings were fresh and plentiful and the pizza was cooked perfectly. \n\nWe also tried the white pizza when we order for the office and it was good but I think it could have used more garlic (but I love garlic so it may just be me). \n\nWe also shared an order of chicken fingers and an order of the garlic parmesean chips one day for lunch. The fingers are really good, crunchy on the outside but moist and tender on the inside with a nice flavor to the breading and the honey mustard dipping sauce was really good. The garlic chips were sooooo good. A little greasy but since they are freshly fried I expected that but the flavor and the texture of the chips was just wonderful.\n\nThe prices were good for the amount of food, each time that hubby and I shared we were both full and the total with tip was under $25.\n\nNow that I work in Tivoli I think this will be a common lunch stop for me."
5,"I like the fresh and easy near me, well kinda near me on Dysart.\nBut after telling a few folks about the place they say they do not find it. So as I was driving bye today, I can see why. The sign is so small and from the street not really noticable. This is too bad."
5,The Art of Detail Auto Spa is incredible!!! Everyone on staff is knowledgeable and incredibly detailed in everything that they do. Art and his crew are out of the ordinary because they like to have fun. When these guys show up they handle their business and have fun the whole time. I highly recommend this business to anyone and everyone I know!
5,"I visited las Vegas for the first time and after 50 years of growing up in Irish Cathpolic New England family had the best Irish food of my life. But, moreso the service was exceptional and the most friendly of anywhere we went in the city. We were so disappointed other places we came back for a second dinner here. It made me proud of my heritage. The staff was as nice as any restaraunt I have ever been. The corned beef and cabbage and the fish and chips were spectacular! After, debacles at two other restaraunts due to poor service or lackluster food at high prices we found this place and would love to go to any of the ones located on the east coast especially the ones in Maine and New Hampshire. Thanks, for being a really bright light for us in a city of supposed bright lights.\nJohn E. Wood\nP.S. I read one of the other reviews and it referred to a gyro. I do not believe they serve them at the Ri Ra but, if they did why would ordera gyro at an Irish Pub. Also, I thought the Nine Fine Irishmen place at New York, New York was horrible so I am not just looking to promote Irish places!"
5,If you are coming for atmosphere then move along. When we visited on a Saturday night a few weeks back we were the only diners eating in the restaurant for the 1st 30 mins of our meal! \n\nBut frankly who cares. I am a nut for Chicken Tikka Masala and this place does the best in the Valley period. The Naan bread was maybe a little too dry but what did I care when I was dipping it in such deliciousness!\n\nI won't go anywhere else for Indian food now.
5,This place is one of my favorites. Everything is always so fresh and their soups in a bread bowl are to die for. The staff is always friendly and fast. They also deliver and do catering.
5,"I have been a big fan of Mercurio's since the first time I visited.  I'm surprised I didn't get to writing a review about it in the time I lived in PGH. Better later than never, I guess. Let's talk about Mercurio's in its latest location reincarnation. The quality of the gelato is superb, and I haven't disliked one flavour I've tried. Personally, I like the texture and the flavour punch of gelato better compared to its sister, ice cream. Some of my favourite flavours at Mercurio's are: lemon basil, chocolate hazelnut (Nutella), raspberry chocolate chip, and the dark stracciatella. Seriously, you can never go wrong with Mercurio's. The people that work there are super friendly too, and it's a family-run business. I'm glad they moved to this spot right on Walnut, but they have a lot of traffic during the hotter months no matter where they are located. Try it out if you're ever in the Eastside."
5,the rocking chairs in the middle is pretty neat. very southern... only airport/place in the tri-state area that has jamba juice.\n\nfree wifi if I remember correctly...
5,We eat lunch here at least once a week. This place is always crazy busy and that's because everything is delish! Take a friend and split a deluxe calzone and a spicy chicken salad. Everyone raves about pizza muffins and they are great too. I don't know anyone who has had anything they didn't like. Prices are really reasonable too.
5,"I hesitate to do this review because it can get busy in here, and let's face it, who wants to wait when you feel like crapola?\nThis urgent care I have made my \""primary care\"" because it is staffed with ER doctors and you don't get the typical \""physicians assistant\"" treatment. \nIn fact, when I first went on Labor Day of 2010, the doctor there sent me to the ER and correctly diagnosed me after a month of misdiagnosis by my now former Top Doctor! \nYesterday I went because I have a cold (no big deal) and an ear infection (big deal, I am a flight attendant and have to fly and that is a No-NO with an ear infection). There was a long wait (about an hour and a half) but once I got in to see the doctor, it was 15 minutes and I was out of there!\nVery clean, organized, and professional, and EVERYONE is very, very nice.\nHighly recommend this place, folks! Call in advance if you're concerned about the wait...and for God's sake, please cover your mouth when you cough and cover your nose when you sneeze!"
5,"I love this place.  Best Thai restaurant in Phoenix....even better than the Thai I have had since moving to the Bay Area a few years ago.  When we come back to the Valley...a trip to Siamese Kitchen is a must.\n\nI used to work close by and would eat lunch there frequently.  My wife would drive across town...I think she was more into the food than hanging out with me.  The food was always fresh, delicious and incredibly flavorful.  \n\nThe prices are great, the quality is great and the two ladies who run the place are great."
5,"Hands down five stars!! From the smiles and friendly greetings to the vet and assistants to the grooming staff downstairs - hats off. Great pricing too, I will be back for any of my pets' needs."
5,"Great selection, friendly staff, fantastic food! Can't say enough about this place. Make sure to check this place out. Carnegie coffee also carriers their donuts if you can't make it all the way to Crafton."
5,"This family-owned small chain of Pizza joints is my favorite place in Arizona to get a pie. I have never ventured to Pizza Bianchi, partly because I am told that there is an hour and a half wait, and really, who has an hour and a half to wait outside in Phoenix for pizza? I have been to Grimaldi's. Grimaldis was very adequate.\nNellos is extravagant pizza! They make their own sausage in house. Chicago style. They have Sicillian style too, but I avoid it and opt for a thin crust. I have had a few salads at Nellos and both were ample and delicious. This place seems like a good place to watch a game or have a pint as well, with plenty of good beer on tap. \nOne of the owners is a local artist so there are plenty of fun things to look at even if you aren't watching a D-Backs game.\nI like the atmosphere at the Gilbert restaurant the best. The outdoor patio is great, but the artist/owner runs the Scottsdale location."
5,"I have only been at lunchtime but I have been to Basil dozens of dozens of times. The basil rolls are amazing and I get them nearly every time I go. The Pad Kee Mow, Pad Thai and the Pad Woon See are my go to's if I want noodles. They will spice up any dish at your request so I always ask them to spice the noodles up and it is delish. But my favorite dish is the Pad Prik. The red curry sauce here is phenomenal and should not be missed out on if you enjoy curry. Hands down, my favorite Thai food in Charlotte."
5,Love love love all the sad flavors and this is the only place in town I can find Harry Potter candy and butterbeer :). My boyfriend loves the green river soda so we will back again and again. They are always friendly and now have a punch card for discounts! Awesome place for gifts and out of the ordinary stocking suffers and b day treats.
5,Long drive threw lines SOMETIMES but    worth the   wait (: people don't mind lines when it comes down too eating a burger from here.  Easy menu.
5,Marlene C. is awesome. Always asks me what I want on each visit. That is VERY important. Your stylist should NEVER assume they know what you want.
5,"We just came here today for the first time & we already love this place!!!  The owner checked us in & he is very friendly & helpful.   Everything is clean & well taken care of.  We have been here since right after they opened at 9:30 am & my 4 yr old little girl is still playing & very happy!!  There are kids of all ages here & there is something to do for all of them!   Moms,dads & a nanny or two have been here.  There are lots of toys, dress up outfits, ride on cars etc.  What a great place to take my little girl!!!"
5,"Chicken and Waffles:\n\nChicken is brined for 3 days, then pan-seared and finally roasted for 8 hours before being served with a light tangy mushroom/vegetable sauce next to 4 quarter waffles infused with bacon and chives with optional vanilla bean whipped butter and a sweet honey syrup.\n\nI would eat here again."
5,"I LOVE Hyvee it was the best thing to happen to the East Side .. They have healthy food, the staff is super friendly.. I am a vegetarian they have a long list of foods and healthy frozen entrees, they have an array of juices and smoothies and they carry my favorite fig and walnut yogurt (its in that healthy section) .. and there is always wine on sale!"
5,"I have had the pizza here twice now and can tell you that I will *definitely* return for more!  The boxes/packaging is very clever, the ingredients are very fresh, everything is made to order right in front of you.  \n\nIt is said that actions speak louder than words and this is so true!  The fact that they care about ensuring that each customer is satisfied definitely shows!  \n\nI haven't tried their gluten free however the fact that they offer gluten free gets two thumbs up from me!!!  \n\nI ordered the New Yorker both times I was there, the second time I tried their garlic knots. One word:  YUMMY!!!  Mouthgasm!  \n\nFor one like me who eats one or two slices and is full, their pizza provided four meals so a definite bonus!  Delicious cold too...  Generous with sauce, which was AMAZING by the way...  \n\nHaven't tried the ice cream cups yet, perhaps next time when I try a pizza other than the New Yorker.  Now to decide which friend to bring...  Hmmm...  Decisions, decisions...  \n\nSeriously, you have GOT to check them out!  Everyone is so friendly, courteous, outgoing, helpful, and NICE (they all really seem to truly enjoy their job and it shows).  \n\n\""Live long and prosper\"" --Spock ...........It applies here!"
5,"Two hispanic painters spent 3 days perfectly painting differenct shades throughout my condo, excellent preparation and prefessional in everyway! I highly recommend them in every way! Good price for perfection! Highly recommended"
5,I'm new to the area and picked this place from the other reviews. The price was very affordable. I had a pretty bad scratch on my car and it was fixed within 2 days. They also washed the outside and the inside of my car for no additional charge. The people who work there are generally friendly. They can sometimes drive you home or pick you up to and from the shop if you don't have any other means while they are working on your car. I will definitely return.
5,"Oh Royal... I love this place. This location is perfect - right off the light rail and on the way to campus. It's very accessible and the outdoor patio is going to be great for these cooler fall days. The coffee is premium and the baristas are always friendly. The general feel of the place is right up my alley. All of the wood and metal gives it both an urban and rustic feel.\n\nIt's a wonderful coffee shop, a great place to come with a book and read, or bring your computer and get some work done. Whatever you're looking for in a coffee shop, Royal is pretty much guaranteed to have it."
5,So there is nothing I can say but OH MY GOSH THIS PLACE IS HEAVEN ON EARTH! I ate here and felt likens was on an episode of good eats or a food network special! The combination of ingredients on the fatty menus is nostalgia mixed with sensory overload! Literally my taste buds exploded! The skinny menu was equally as delicious and made me feel like I was cheating even though I wasn't! \n\nThe atmosphere is amazing and the staff was friendly! They even had healthy items I could feed my 2 yr old that has a horrible dairy and gluten allergy! Hands down I was impressed!\n\nI recommend the chicken and waffles on the fatty menu! The chick with mango chuten and basil yogurt dip is amazing on the skinny menu! But seriously you can't go wrong!\n\nThe best part about this place is there is something for everyone. The patio was comfortable and was dog friendly! I will definitely go back and being friends!
5,I have been coming here since I was little.  Some people do not like the mom and pop restaurant because they are not that modern.  I think these are places are great. This is a great place to go.  They have a lot of good old fashioned comfort food.  This place is very simple so if you are looking for a grand place this is not it.  But good food and good people are always here. Very family freindly.
5,"I freaking LOVE this place! We used to live in the NW part of town, and were regulars here. The Almond Milk Tea with boba is one of the best things I have ever drank! Sadly, we have now moved to the SW side of town, and miss this place tremendously, as nothing down here even comes close. Whenever my fiance golfs at Painted Desert I make him bring me back tea from here. Please open another spot down here, or in Henderson!!! ASAP PLEASE!"
5,"BURGERS MADE IN HEAVEN, with cheese curds (which I've never heard of, maybe this is a Wisconsin thing? but they are gooooood) and onion rings (thin, crispy, couldn't stop eating those) on the side. \n\nI have never cared less about table manners and gobbled down a burger this fast in my life."
5,"If you want a great cut and a perfect color...... then ask for Michael!!\nI dont know about you but sometimes getting your hair done can be so time consuming.  Especially when you have kids, you basically want to get in and out of the salon.  Michael is amazing, quick, and reasonably priced!!\nI moved to vegas in 2006 and was actually commuting to LA to get my hair done, because I was afraid that a new stylist was going to screw up my color!    can you imagine I was actually driving 4 hours just to get my hair done??  Until my sister introduced me to Michael, I have to admit I was skeptical at first, but I decided to give him a shot!  I am SO glad I did!!  Best decision ever!!  Michael did an amazing job!!  He knew exactly what color to choose for me, and it came out even better than my stylist in LA .(who had been doing my hair for 15 years!!)  Normally I'd be sitting in a salon for 4-5 hours.  Not with Michael!!  Michael has such a great personality..... so along with being a awesome stylist and a quick stylist he makes getting your hair done a great experience!!  I love Michael.  SInce then I have moved back to LA and the one thing I miss is getting my hair done by Michael!!  I haven't been super happy with my stylist or my hair since leaving Las vegas.....Michael is on my agenda for my next visit!!"
5,"I don't think I give 5 stars often but on the items we ordered, they deserve 5 stars.\n\nOrdered the salmon which was pan seared crispy on one side, and rare plus on the inside.  It was seriously one of those unique times when a restaurant just cooked a piece of salmon perfectly.\n\nWe also had the green chile pork pot pie.  Crust was good, crispy and doughy and very comforting.  The green chile sauce was very flavorful and tasty as well.\n\nI had their house chardonnay which was pretty affordable.\n\nIt's a coffee house/hipster vibe so it's casual and also a place you can eat and just hang out as well.\n\nThey have a great drink selection (including craft cocktails), I didn't try the cocktails but they all looked good.  Also a full selection of coffee as well.\n\nConvenient to the downtown area and a great alternative to some of the more expensive and probably not good restaurants in downtown.\n\nAlso got a free cookie for yelp check-in!  Peanut butter was great but so is the smore cookie!"
5,I usually get on Yelp to gripe about things.  But I have been going to Sunchain for almost a year now and their level of customer service is great.  They are always friendly and greet you with a cheerful smile when you walk in.  Everything is always clean and the price can't be beat.
5,"If you want THE BEST in gel, glitter. etc...Look no further.  I've been a client of Lynn's since she first moved to Vegas and she is AWESOME.  You are not only paying for the \""designs/glitter\"", you're also paying for QUALITY.  In other words, you get what you pay for.  Although I'm in \""starving student\"" mode right now, I'll be back Lynn. =)  Dawn is great too (never had work done but she is awesome)..."
5,"When an experience is perfect, I've gotta give it five stars.  The hostess, waitress and chef we're friendly and helpful.\n\nI had a caprese sandwich.  They bake their own pannini rolls fresh every morning.  This is a winner"
5,"Another one of the budget afternoon shows in Vegas that suprises you. It is quite entertaining. Well worth the admission of ($20 to $30) for some laughs and good tricks. \n\nHe likes to mix the show with other performers in Vegas, so you will get a well rounded show (not just magic). \n\nGo to this show and use the ticket stub to get discount entrance to other vegas shows."
5,"One of my faves in Vegas.  My room was clean, and the view was amazing.  Check in was a breeze and I was able to upgrade at the desk.  Great location, amenities, and service."
5,"Chili Dogs \""All The Way\"" here are pretty quintessential \""carolina style\"" and not to be missed.  Add slaw for a twist.  The burgers are also perfect."
5,"After my airbrush tan upstairs at Bronze Beauty of Las Vegas, I was hungry and picked up a large tomato and basil pizza. It was incredible. Best pizza in town by far!"
5,"It was a Sunday morning at 11:30 am and my friends and I had miraculously left our room by check-out time and dragged ourselves down to the 2nd floor of the Imperial Palace where the Hash House lives.  There was a gigantic crowd waiting outside, but we ended up being called to our table within 10 minutes.\n\nWe tried to glance at some other tables on our way in to get an idea of the food...and holy crap the portions are huge.  I recommend splitting if you can...you'll definitely still be full even with half of a meal.  \n\nOur table of 3 ordered:  the tractor driver combo with the griddled french toast, the corned beef hash, and the original eggs benedict.  I sampled all of them and everything was amazing.  I supplemented my french toast breakfast with a much needed Bloody Maria.  This was my first time having the Bloody Maria, which uses tequila instead of vodka, and it was outstanding.  Settled my stomach and removed my hangover successfully!!\n\nI was not even close to finishing my french toast.  There were two inch and a half thick slices that were about 5 inches square.  It was flavorful and served with a grilled banana.  \n\nOur service was quick, friendly and attentive - no glasses were left empty and the coffee refills were plentiful.  \n\nOnly downside, aside from being in the Imperial Palace, is that the restaurant has no bathrooms of its own...and so you have to go wander through the casino and use the ones there."
5,"OMG!  This place just gets better and better.  We are having to make excuses to go to Urbana from rural Tolono.  Wish they would bring one to the Savoy area.  \n\nMy husband got the 3 meat, 2 sides platter.  He was sooo happy with his choices. sliced Beef Brisket,,(so tender!) sliced  Polish,, and a pile of sliced smoked ham.  The meat was pleantiful to say the least....he scarffed the whole platter down; smacking his lips after every bite.  I'm afraid I wasn't much different.  I got the smoked humongus baked potato with pulled pork and hot sauce and then proceeded to the potato topping bar for lots of butter, onions, shredded cheddar, halapeno's with a smidge of habenaro sauce on the side.  I have enough left over for lunch tomorrow and dinner tomorrow night and still share some with hubby. \n\nThis place is the best.  The employees are friendly, helpful and have great attitudes.  Probably because they're looking forward to their next break so they can partake of some of these lipsmacking great smoked delicasies!\n\nW and S \nTolono, IL"
5,"Absolutely delicious! If you're a foodie, you will absolutely LOVE this place. And if you're anything like my wife and me, you'll leave the antique store with a few goodies, too! We tried the burger the the chicken sandwich - both were phenomenal. The sweet potato chips and tater tots were to die for, as well."
5,"This has always been a great mall, is shows its age very well. This has to be an expensive location since stores are always closing or moving to a different location in the mall. \n\nThis has always had a great selection of different stores inside and around the mall along with lots of places to eat. Has a decent play area for the kids, and a snack shop right by the play area where they dont charge any taxes, why I have no idea. \n\nDouble decker merry go round is always hit with the kids 2 rides for $5 and adults ride free with kids. \n\nGreat place to escape the Summer heat but just remember when you go back to your car its going to be 200 degrees inside of it."
5,"I'm dreaming of being on a sandy beach near Kona, Hawaii and craving Da Poke Shack and so sad it's not real, but BAM, here come Poke Express with the exact same thing! Total Score & totally worth the drive anytime I'm craving poke. The only thing that made me sad was no rice when I came in (not sure if they ever have it). \n\nThe poke here is really good & can't wait to go back"
5,Salon Faith is a great place for all of your hair care. They are very friendly and helpful. My 14 year old daughter gets the best treatment ever at this place. She love the fact that she gets the full hair treatment every time she makes honor roll at school. She hasn't missed honor roll yet!
5,"I have been by this place several times now. Also now that I am far more aware of what I am eating, I pay attention.\nSo today I went in. I found out this place has been here for 10 years.\nIt is a bakery, as well as an Eat in or to go dinner.\nSo much to choose from in here as well.\nBread, cookies, bagels,Pizza dough,muffins, etc, etc, etc...\n\nI also really like that you can buy your own mixes on everything and make it your self if you so want to do it.\nMenu for meals is great and when you see all the food places they supply to you will be surprised as well.\nThe even sell all types of cakes. You can order them form the book complete with decorations.\nIt is not all too cheap in here. But, A little extra effort is worth the extra price ,I think.\nWhen we are all swelling up like Balloons changing your diet can do wonders.\nI will be happy to come back here. Yeah, for a great find!"
5,"This popped my first Vegas show cherry & it was everything that I expected it to be: dazzling, colorful, musical, surprising and massive audience participation full of laughs and unexpected touches. \n\nOpt in for the poncho section because they're cheaper, you really won't get that splashed with paint and being able to see the little tweaks in their facial expressions are absolutely priceless and add a whole new dynamic to their performances.\n\nWhat you might expect: percussion drums + paint, dance moves and a whole lot of toilet paper. \n\nThere is some English spoken by a disembodied announcer but overall, its perfect for non-English speakers too and kids of course!"
5,"5 stars is for the ambiance, the food, and the mood.  Had a great time here.  Ordered a simple rice and orange chicken dish.  They also have sushi here.  Very modern decor and lighting was dark, yet subtle.  Asked my girl to be my girlfriend here, so that may have biased my opinion just a bit.  But now this place will always be a special spot."
5,"Couldn't be happier! Great washers and dryers & such, but even better looking men (; Plus the boss has such nice skin, I wonder where he gets his facials?"
5,"First time at this place and it was awesome!! Jeff the chef was super nice and his stuff is amazing, can't wait until he starts serving dinner."
5,"After a day of travel, The Keg provided a delicious meal and wonderful service provided by Paul.  We arrived just before the rush of people, at about 6pm.  After ordering and informing Paul about my allergy to mushroom (which the menu contained a lot of mushrooms), the kitchen manager came out to reassure me that there were no mushrooms on my salad and the chicken to top my salad, would be cooked in a different part of the kitchen to prevent cross contamination.  Not one complaint.  Great restaurant, amazing food, great service.  Would go back in a heartbeat.  Location was a bonus too, right on St. Paul Street which is a famous, street quaint, and right in the heart of the historic section of Montreal. WIN!!"
5,"Delicious buffet:  looking forward to late lunch, before 3;pm.\nEaten here before, and will definetely keep going back.\nI never tire of their dishes...just yummy!"
5,"Yelp, I can always count on you!  As I will probably continue to note ad nauseum, I am looking for good sushi since moving to Pittsburgh.  I think I may have found another contender!  \n\nFirst of all, the service is spectacular.  The staff is attentive and so kind.  Everyone seems genuinely interested in providing a positive experience.  Secondly, they have a full bar.  This means a lot, since most BYOBs in the 'Burgh charge a corking fee (WTF?).  I was able to order a small house sake for $5 and it paired so nicely with my meal.\n\nWe started with the gyoza, which was fried crispy (I'm used to pan fried).  Good, but a bit greasier than what I'm used to since it was deep fried.  I went for one of the sushi dinners, which included miso soup and salad.  The miso was yummy!   Perfectly seasoned and not burn your face off hot.  The sushi was really great. Huge pieces of fish when it comes to the nigiri and my roll was quite tasty. \n\nI think most people wouldn't expect a good experience like this on Carson, but the ambiance was nice too.  I saw a couple having a delightful date in front of me, while I had a girl's night with a friend.  Did I mention that the price was right?!  \n\nIn short, my favorite  find so far.  I'd love to see more specialty rolls on their menu, but they do SUCH a great job with what they've got.  I'm a happy camper!"
5,Wow!!!!  This place is AMAZING!!!  As soon as you walk in the aroma tantalizes you.  The first bite was all it took.  The pulled pork melted in my mouth and the mac & cheese...mmmmm good.  This is as good as it gets.  I will definitely be back for more.
5,"From the very friendly greeting to....\n\n....many pieces of great advise this was a first class experience . \nMartini (Leech)was perfect.\nFood was excellent , wine was great (and not crazy expensive) and the service the best of what we experienced in Vegas.\nWill come back. Thank you for a great dinner.\nBy the way - very much consider sharing - as the food and portions invite one to do this."
5,My friend and I when here one day for lunch and we were both very impressed. Both of our dishes were beyond delish! We also had kiddos with us and though they didn't have a kids menu they still catered to them and had no problem they were with us (of course they were very well behaved). I took a look at their dinner menu and though it is a little pricy I really want to go back and give it a try. I love all of the seafood options! Service and atmosphere were both very nice as well.
5,"I went as a party of 6 for my parent's 40th wedding anniversary dinner.  When I made the reservation weeks before the date, via OpenTable, I mentioned in the \""comments\"" box that it was a special night for my parents.  When our server first approached the table he addressed my parents with a \""Happy Anniversary\"" and a \""Congratulations.\""  It made them feel special and set the tone for a wonderful evening.   I was a little worried about taking them to the Grand Concourse for a special event because I read the reviews on Yelp and other sites saying that the venue was beautiful, the food was so-so and the service was terrible.  I am 100% happy that we took a chance.  The evening was wonderful.  We were seated in the river view dining area and at first I was disappointed because everyone talked about how beautiful the main dining area was (it was reserved for a wedding).  The river dining room was cozy with a fabulous view of the night city skyline across the river.  Our waiter was friendly, he went above and beyond providing great service for the table.  The food was very good and portions nicely sized.  I will 100% go back and hopefully have a chance to check out the main dining room."
5,"Ingos has a great atmosphere and food is great.  They use grass fed meat for all burgers and there are incredibly important reasons why grass fed is so much better. Both nutritionally and in treatment of animals.  All the other items on the menu are great as well, they have great beers, apps and other menu items besides burgers. The only recommendation I would offer the restaurant has to do with their \""to go\"" burgers.  I'm not sure if it has to do with the bun and/or the way you request the burger to be cooked but only when I order to go I almost always get a soggy bun which I of course do not like. Eating at the restaurant this never happens.  Great place"
5,We get PeiWei at work a lot and they are awesome. \nI love their Viet. wraps & veggie pad thai!\nThey always have the take- out order fast and food is great!
5,"I'm a Los Angeles native that comes out to Phoenix a lot to visit my sisters. This place is a must on every trip out here. \n\nGreat bartenders, food and service.  There's not many places in the Metro Phoenix area to go to, but this is it. A must for anyone anywhere near Peoria and the 17 fwy."
5,"This club is top notch in all respects.  not only is it gorgeous and way out of my league, but it is a lot of fun.  I truly felt like Tiger (or his cousin Panther) off the tee because that thin air let that ball travel.  The greens play slower than what i'm used to in CA and NV, so put some oomph into your puts.  I have never seen so many streams, lakes, and waterfalls through 18 holes.  \n\nMore than anything, the staff is very friendly and accommodating.  I felt like a king - this isn't out of the ordinary for a place of this caliber.  What is is the food.  The food was excellent and priced similar to a cafe instead of a golf course.  I ate the buffet breakfast and was wowed - this was the best breakfast I've eaten under $10 (tax and tip included!) anywhere.   It even beat some more expensive breakfasts.  The buffet lunch after our golf tourney was also excellent all around.  Also, the wait staff was perfect.  \n\nCome here if you want to live the country club life.  After a day here i wanted to call myself Chaz and go yachting.  Everything is well priced compared to other courses except the course fee, but it is money well spent."
5,"Wow.  That was awesome!  We were walking down Fremont and noticed that this comedy show was starting soon and figured we'd check it out.  Well, thank God we did!  Hands down one of the funny people I have ever seen!  Absolutely brilliant!  From start to end, the entire theater was laughing hysterically!  I can't say enough!  This is a MUST see if you are on Fremont St. or really anywhere in Vegas.  Make the trip, you won't be disappointed.  You can't beat it, especially for the price.  I'd pay three times the amount to watch him again!"
5,"Tammy and Shelly are super sweet servers!theyre my favorite, I have usually done pick up orders in the past since I work near by, I dined in only once after work with coworkers. The steak fries are my favorite and their burgers are simple and taste homemade which is why I like them so much. I don't really eat this type of food but it's perfect for a delicious cheat meal splurge. If I'm gonna be bad it's gonna be with something this good!!"
5,"Honestly I was hesitant to try the cold toppings, but I was glad I had it.  I have had NY pizza, Chicago pizza and this was totally different.  No grease dripping off the pizza.  Nice change from the norm."
5,"Unreal. Wonderful family run establishment. I've dined here now 8-9 times. From the moment you walk in the friendly, courteous staff are there for you! ! The food, nothing short of phenomenal, from the veal dishes to the handmade pasta, all ridiculously good and prepared fresh to order. Unbelievable wine list for you wine lovers as well. I'm literally drooling just writing this review. Can't wait to return. Enjoy this off the strip gem."
5,"This place is amazing. A friend brought me here when I was visiting from out of town and I was really impressed. This may be my new favorite Thai food place. They have a ton of creative options on the menu that look delicious. When I told the waiter I was a vegetarian, he said that they could make 90% of things vegetarian. I asked whether that included using beef broth and fish sauce and he clarified that they use vegetarian broth and a veggie substitute for the fish sauce for all of the veggie dishes. Amazing! I got a delicious noodle dish that I'm now craving again. My friend got peanut chicken and sticky rice with mango, both of which looked delicious. I would definitely recommend this place."
5,"I spent my honeymoon in Edinburgh. We were introduced to Treacle on our first night in town by some local Yelpers. \n\nThe style of the place is anime meets modern romantic. It's a little over the top for me, but I can look past it because the drinks menu, oh the drinks menu, is WOW. During several trips to Treacle while we were in town, I tried the Pear and Violet Mule, The Silver Fern and the Elderflower Fix. They were all so delicious and the ingredients were so unique.\n\nWe didn't try the food, but it looked and smelled YUM-O!"
5,"Service was great! Really nice menu, with a lot of options. I had strawberry pancakes, which were very flavorful. Also had mexican omlette, which had carnitas, jalapenos and pico de gallo. Very good. We love the variety of dishes offered. You can choose to go simple, or can choose something with a little bit of a twist and not be sorry. We will definitely be coming back."
5,"On our long drive from Phoenix to Provo, we looked up restaurants as we were driving through vegas and wanted to stop somewhere and grab some lunch.  We looked on our phones and found Old School in north vegas.  not sure what we were getting ourselves into we decided to stop in and have a bite.  We got the vegas meets Italy pizza and we were absolutely impressed.  The blend of cheeses, tomatoes and date sauce was a great change of pace.  We liked it so much we will surely stop by on our way home."
5,"My one student wrote her review for YELP! Club about Cheesecake Factory, so this is actually Fiorella's review (6th grade student):\n\nMy experience at Cheesecake Factory was very delightful. The service was excellent because our server Angelo was kind and patient when we were ordering. The cleanliness was very good considering the amount of time the servers have to clean the table, since there are so many customers. The time we had to wait to be seated was understandable because Cheesecake Factory is always crowded. Overall my experience was very good. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to friends."
5,I went to Tipton Orthodontics in preparation for a major jaw surgery. The surgery consisted of cutting through the top and bottom jaw and slipping the top jaw forward while sliding the bottom jaw back. The Tipton team were very nice and friendly and made sure I was ready to go by the time the surgery came around. Thanks Tipton Orthodontics!\n-Stephanie Lauk
5,"We came here tonight after seeing a few glowing recommendations from Facebook friends.  I am from the east coast and therefore very skeptical of any local 'seafood'.  I am SO GLAD I tried this place!!!  Everything was amazing,  including the service from Will.  He went way above and beyond his duty and made our experience even more amazing than the shrimp!  We will DEFINITELY be back!  \n\nI just wish they were open on Sundays..."
5,"The cocktails are the absolute best in the city. Try the Aviation and the Citizen.\n\nThey keep all the best dishes on the menu while also adding other creative dishes. I hope they keep the pastrami pork belly for ever.\n\nThe service is always exceptional. Sit at the bar if you don't like to wait even a minute for another cocktail.\n\nI have been there about thirty times, and I have never had a less than stellar experience."
5,"I love Community Florist!  I use them to get bimonthly flowers to decorate my salon and I also used them for my wedding.  They worked with my budget and I couldn't believe how many flower arrangements I got for what I spent. I was also able to make payments which really helped.  My bridal bouquet was absolutely stunning and matched my personality and accented my dress.  Their prices are amazing as well and they can work with any budget.  Over the last year I have purchased arrangements to celebrate birthdays, love, accidents and even death.  I can go in there and give them a bit of history of why I need an arrangement and tell them a bit about the person and they create the most perfectly beautiful personalized one.  You can also get amazing terrariums created here as well.  They also have classes on floral arranging.  Thank you Community Florist for bringing such wonderful flowers into my life!"
5,"I don't write about every restaurant I eat at, just the ones that show something special. This is truly a five star old school Italian restaurant. Anyone who gives it less is just screwing with the ratings (and I've been to most of the north beach restaurants). Got recommended by the concierge at the Marriott. I applaud anyone who could find it without a taxi. It is less than nondescript from the outside. Once you go down the stairs and through the industrial door you come upon a busy place. People will find good food. The menu is in Italian. It is extensive and the staff is happy to translate. The wine lists also extensive and all Italian. The sugar packs are from Italy. Getting the pattern here. They are not afraid to scream old Italy because they can do it first class. Soup of the day was stingray soup. I was thinking Asian, but noodles in seafood broth  with shredded stingray fin was right off the coast of Italy. There were so many great things on the menu. I chose the Osso bucco, great. My wife had the fettuccine with mushrooms, fantastic. Would I go again. You bet. I will say I asked them to call me a cab to get back to the hotel, after all it is near old town but a little of the beaten track."
5,"I went in for a Brazilian wax so I was a little nervous. Immediately, she made me feel comfortable. You can tell she has a lot of experience because she was thorough & quick. I can't wait to schedule a facial & massage with her. Thanks for the awesome experience!"
5,"This restaurant worthes a WOW (and there is not so many chinese restaurants in Mtl worth that)! It serves real authentic Chinese plats such as Porc enrob\u00e9 de farine de riz cuit \u00e0 la vapeur(\u7c89\u84b8\u8089)--the best I had in Mtl, which are as delicious as their \""American Chinese\"" plats such as the classic General Tao chicken.\n\nThe owner is so nice and staff is very helpful. They said that as the opposite of most of chinese restaurants, they will focus not only on the cuisine, but also on the service. I asked for a take out, and everything was so well packed to keep their original flavour.\n\nAnd finally a great BYOW restaurant in CDN! Bravo! Keep going on!"
5,"Amazing facility and friendly staff. This place is huge! Indoor track, basketball court, tennis courts, pool, racquetball... the works! Great place to take the kids too with their famous Kids World. Check it out.\n\nFollow me on twitter! www.twitter.com/edsonhong"
5,"I totally agree with \""Stephanie B\"".  I've raised two kids and have been in plenty of urgent cares over the past 30 years but this one was, by far, the best.  The staff was incredibly friendly - front desk, nurses and physician.  My husband got treated incredibly fast (as did all the others that needed care).  There were four other people who needed to be seen and by the time my husband was done (only a 30 minute total visit time) everyone else had already been treated.  I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND that if you're in the NE Phoenix/Scottsdale area and need an Urgent Care - definitely don't hesitate to go to this one."
5,Look for Charlie. This guy really knows his stuff! He was able to diagnose the problem with our car quickly and fix it. Excellent customer service. I highly recommend using them. Charlie is like a car detective!
5,"The best view in the valley! The patio overlooks the valley,  what a great place to relax and sip on some wonderfully prepared cocktails with your significant other.  The food is always something special,  artfully prepared.  The staff is always on point and ready to please."
5,"L'Atelier - does that mean \""the best butter\"". Call me ghetto if you want, but one of the best things we had here was the french  Echir  butter. I could put this butter on anything and it would shine with pride. \n\nWe went with one Prix Fix and many carte items to accompany. This wound up working really well for us and I'd recommend the strategy to others. \n\nEssentially every ting was great - langoustine fritter, tuna belly, gelee, suckling pig (oui oui), mashed potatoes (they are known for them and BTW they are like 35% \""butter\"") and more. The beef rib eye was good, but the Poached baby Kussi oysters with French butter we the highlight for me - two orders please.\n\nA more entertaining way to have a phenomenal meal..."
5,"Great tea store!  The owner is always on site and is the most knowledgeable tea person that I have ever met.  They have samples of all of their teas to smell before purchasing, such a great idea.   They also have a nice store with plenty of neat items to purchase."
5,I love this little boutique candy shop! Treat your sweet tooth here! Milk chocolate gummy bears are my fave! Service is amazing! They also have glittered cotton candy!...whaaaat! :) so happy I work nearby!
5,"This place hit the spot. \n\nStopped here before a movie and ate at the bar. We got just what we wanted: quick service and some good eats. \n\nI recommend the fried green beans with aioli  -- soooo good! Who knew I liked green beans?! And this trip I tried some sushi and got the spicy tuna roll. Although it was clearly not pieced together by an expert sushi chef, it was extremely fresh and delish (so who cares if it's not beautiful?!)"
5,"Fantastic. \n\nExcellent items:\n- Kobe Skirt Steak: Our waiter assured me that I would not be disappointed - and he was right. It melted in my mouth it was so good. \n- Buffalo Mozzarella: Topped with a roasted red pepper. So, so wonderful. \n\nGreat items:\n- Ribeye: The rib eye was great - but the Kobe Skirt Steak was better!\n- Brussels Sprouts: I love Sprouts - I think mine are better - but Colicchio's were great!\n\nGood items:\n-Potato Puree: It was really good - but I could have done with out. \n\nThe food was awesome. The restaurant was really warm - it took us a while to cool down. \n\nThere was a lady walking around offering to take pictures - we went along and got our photo taken - it was outrageously priced and I think it cheapened the dining experience. Other than that, no complaints!"
5,"Danielle was recommended by a friend, when I complained about a bda cut I got elsewhere in town.  I am so glad I took her advice!  Danielle did an excellent job with my color and cut.  Like other Yelpers mentioned, she took the time to ask about my styling routine, how I like for it to look and what I wanted to do differently.  The color is AMAZING.  It looks exactly how I wanted it to turn out - -like nothing happened! AND talk about shine!  I have definitely gotten my fair share of compliments.  Danielle did such a great job, I even treated my Mom to a cut/color when she came to visit!!  If you are looking for a great stylist in Vegas (and trust me I have tried MANY without any luck), Danielle is a safe bet!"
5,"I came here to get a tan before heading off to Mexico for vacation. Let me just say, my tan was PERFECT. I would get one every other week if I could afford it! Erika was fantastic. She made me feel super comfortable and explained the process well. She is truly an artist. I will never go back to booth spray tans. I can't wait for my next special occasion, just so I have an excuse to come back!"
5,"We LOVE us some Yardhouse!!  They always have great service, great food...never disappoints!  I took a picture of my favorite dessert-chocolate souffle'.  It's a tiny little morsel, and just enough to top off a fantastic meal.  It's only around $3, and it's pure heaven.  If you are a chocolate lover,  but are sick of restaurants slaying the \""chocolate cake\"" with a mediocre knock off of a good ol' Duncan's Hines box cake--then this is your chance to indulge in a decadent, warm, rich chocolate treat!\n\nAs far as dinner goes, I'm a huge fan of the Southern Fried chicken, and my hubby loves the Enchilada Stack.  We've never been unhappy with anything we order, they really know how to make a meal...even if it doesn't look at all like it sounds!  For example, their Mac & Cheese is so much more than \""Mac\"" & \""Cheese\"".  It's several kinds of cheeses, mushrooms, chicken, oh my!!\n\nWe recently ate at a Denver Yardhouse location, and it's consistent with our Las Vegas locations! \n\nOh, and I totally forgot about their vast array of beer choices--can't miss with this restaurant!"
5,"I am completely new to this painting party night out, but as someone who is less than artistic, Erica helped me to paint something I was very proud to share with others!  I really had fun while painting the medium difficulty patriotic flip flop piece.  The atmosphere was relaxing and I thoroughly enjoyed painting alongside my friend and other very friendly people nearby!  Erica was thorough in communicating the directions, painted so I could not only hear the  instructions, but see her technique as she painted the same project according to her verbal instructions.  With approximately thirty other painters in the private room at Nacho Daddy,  I appreciated having a second artist helping Erica on the floor and both of them answered the couple questions I had about technique and how to improve a particular area on my painting.  Both of them were extremely helpful and came around often to refill paints and provide positive feedback and encouragement.  Erica encouraged creativity for those more adventurous folks and really seemed to enjoy teaching all of us the techniques required for everyone to go home with a one of a kind painting in just a couple short hours. For anyone looking to attend a paint party, I would strongly encourage you to check out Vegas Painting Parties!  I will definitely be going back sometime soon!"
5,"classy. dim. convenient. tons of LCD tvs. great food.\n\ni recommend the 25$ teriyaki chicken. the way sushisamba prepares chicken teriyaki is unlike any restaurant that ive ever been to. i was expecting some cookie cutter skimpy chicken teriyaki. but to my surprise the chicken teriyaki came on top of a pile of purple mash potatoes and tasted AMAZING. the chicken was flavored perfectly and.. it melted in my mouth. moist, juicy, tender, man did i enjoy chewing that day. in combination with the mash potatoes makes for a most savory dish. \n\nsushi is also a good option here. sushisamba sushi comes lightly wrapped in rice rather than how sushi restaurants ordinarily fill their rolls with rice. i liked that. it accentuated the other ingredients such as kobe beef, caviar etc. we pretty much ordered all the rolls and each one was different from the next. although i cant say i enjoyed the kobe beef one as it was kind of bland. also, i wouldnt recommend the oysters because its quite ordinary."
5,"My son had his 8th birthday party here this past weekend.  When we left he said it was the \""Best Birthday Party EVER!\""  That alone deserves 5 stars.\n\nThis is place is very well run.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  They constantly came up to us to make sure everything was ok and if we needed anything.  The Place has 3 separate rooms that can also be opened up to make 1 or 2 larger rooms depending on the party size.  They were on schedule and had us in and out right on time.  No outside food is allowed except for fruit or veggie trays and adult food. You can also bring your own cake if you want.  Their pizza and wings were very good.  We brought our own sandwiches from Panera Bread and the parents were happy.\n\nThe kids as well as some of the dad's played laser tag. It was surprisingly more fun than I expected.  The playing field was fairly large with separate rooms and two levels.  Very well designed!  You had bases to destroy and you could get hits on the chest, back, shoulders, or gun.  The lasers were very accurate which is what made the game fun.  \n\nI had so much fun myself that I can't wait to take my son back there again."
5,"I love the Marquee. Had so much fun here and I didn't have a drop of alcohol I just danced the night away holding my water glass( was recovering from previous antics but still gotta look social). \n\nCame here on a Monday night. Guestlist ladies in free and everyone the doorman the security guards the bartenders were super nice. \n\nDJ Dirty South was fun. The dance floor was crowded with people. I love Vegas cause the guys look so nice dancing in their suit jackets and slacks. Classy is good. The light show, the confetti the, glow sticks and marquee glow tubes they were handing out were fun to swing around. Everything screamed party and fun but classy. Dance! Dance! Dance! \n\nWoot! Woot! Can't wait to come back."
5,"We kinda hung out here, they were having an Elvis competition night.  We were hanging out by the bar.  We decided to get a couple of drinks, I was going to just stick to something simple, like a margarita!  Well someone pointed out there special drinks, there in huge cups.  I can't remember what we got, but they sure were good. \n\n You can keep the cup, and your refills are only $13.00.  The initial drink is $16.00  Usually we get our drinks at one of the other outside bars, and they just weren't worth it!  From here on out, I know where I'm getting my drinks on Fremont street"
5,"Love Zinc!  I get my Parisian fix here.  The French cuisine is top of the line, and the waiters are on their game.  The ambiance evokes a true bistro in Paris, complete with the bar in the front of the house.  The soups, salads, and entrees are all wonderfully prepared and presented.  I have had only the best at Zinc Bistro!"
5,"I go to D's almost every Wednesday night for a beer and a veggie dog after an hour of bouldering at the Wall.\n\nTheir beer selection changes often, and I've never been disappointed.  If I don't know what the beer is, they'll often bring over a sample to try to make sure I like it.\n\nThe veggie dogs are great, the cheese fries are great, and I've never had a problem with the service.   It can get crowded when a game is on, but just grab a beer and wait for a table.\n\nPros: Fun menu, great draft beer selection, beer cave!\nCons: Sometimes crowded and loud"
5,"This restaurant was absolutely delicious.  My friend Eric recommended we try it and I am glad we did. The pork tenderloin was perfectly cooked, tender and so tasty.  The brussel sprouts were a delicious complement and then to have the banana creme pie dessert was just perfect.  And the signature cocktail was tasty.  I liked the decor and has a very cool trendy vibe.  This restaurant is a must try if you're in Vegas."
5,"These folks used to get knocked for being a bit unfriendly, but in the last year they genuinely seem to like their customers coming in the door. Much more pleasant to shop there now. Very good selection, and fast service. It is a true blessing that they have a store in the middle of nowhere, where I happen to live."
5,"We have visited both the location in Surprise and the location in Arrowhead on several occassions and have never been disappointed. As others have mentioned, the complimentary bread and dipping oil is wonderful. I could make a meal of that alone with a bottle of wine. ;-) \n\nSome of the things we have had....Bruschetta Romana = good, Firecracker Rolls = husband likes, not my favorite, Roasted Brussels Sprout Beet Salad = LOVE, Calzone = Husband loves, Kid's calzone = son orders every time, Italiano Sandwich and Buffalo Chicken Ceasar Sandwich = my adult daughters love. \n\nMy personal favorite meal would be the bread followed by the Roasted Brussels Sprout Beet Salad and The Amalfi Thin & Crusty pizza served with a nice bottle of red wine. I have had some of their pasta dishes as well and they were all very good.\n\nI have never tried their spaghetti and meatballs. I make those at home and can't see paying someone else to make them for me. :)\n\nThe Italian Sodas are a hit with the kids!"
5,"You have to try the velvet!!! Lux is so to die for, we actually had a meeting at my office that it is ok to go during work hours without counting it as a break as long as you bring some back for everyone. (no joke)"
5,"Great place to have dessert after a heavy meal. My friend and I come here quite a bit and each time we leave happy and smiling. We always get the thai tea, it's the perfect balance of robust tea and sweet cream without being so sweet that you're thirsty for water. \nThe decor is very modern, with art work all over the wall mixed in with two hd TVs, the place itself has great lighting and isn't dark at all, gives it that perfect weather hangout atmosphere and the best part is that everyone is welcomed here from kids to adults and hippies to hipsters LOL. \nNew favorite flavor is the the regular cream milk tea accompanied by the red velvet(limited time flavor) with strawberries all over, perfect for valentines. Check the photo :)"
5,I eat lunch here at least once a week. The staff is always friendly and the food is always great. I have not been able to find a better value than their lunch special.
5,"We love Paul Martin's American Grill. The salmon grilled on a cedar plank is fabulous, and the short ribs are killer. \nThey have a wonderful deal on Monday nights (called Monday night wine dinner) and you get two organic salads, two entrees (any entree on the menu) and a bottle of wine (good selection) for $49!! \nIn addition, their Happy Hour is wonderful! \nThe staff is cordial and friendly (we like that in Scottsdale) AND they use local ingredients where they can. \nWhat's not to love?"
5,I've been going to the Thai House about once a month for over a year now. I love it! I've tried a number of other Thai restaurants in the area and this is my favorite.\n\nI often bring friends and no one has ever disliked their meal here. My favorite things to get are the Pho and the Green Curry (which is really spicy). The food is always great. \n\nThe service is even better than the food. They are always prompt and friendly. Most times I am surprised at how fast the food comes out. After going here a while they treat you like family. I would definitely recommend it to others!
5,"Another excellent Rue Duluth restaurant.  On the night we were there, they seemed a little understaffed, but the wait staff were working hard and were well trained. Mushroom appetizer was excellent, as was guinea hen/mushroom entree special.  All in all a great experience.  Pro tip: the depanneur down the block has a few decent bottles of red wine. (This is BYO.)"
5,I was fortunate to stay there for an evening and found good food great accommodations friendly helpful people. Met a pit boss named Steve and a clerk named Grace. Really enjoyed this. A must place to see play and stay.
5,"gorgeous shopping palace. walked in and felt like a princess. too bad I didn't carry enough money to buy anything! The statues and the little waters were just beautiful. It brought back fond memories of my first time stepping into this palace when I was a child. It hasn't changed a bit! Lots of variety of shops, eateries, clubs..etc. \n\nLIKE IT."
5,"First off, know that I'm a skeptical guy by nature.  I sort out attorneys for a living as a lawsuit funder so have developed a keen sense of when someone is trying to pull the wool over my eyes .  I met Andre (the owner of Toyoworks) in 2006 when I brought him my 2002 Land Cruiser after getting two separate quotes both over $2,000 to fix stripped spark plugs stuck in my engine.  The others said they'd need to replace part of my engine when Andre took the time to problem solve and removed all my spark plugs damage free for just over $200.  Since then I've exclusively taken my car to Andre countless times.  Not too long ago. Andre said that my car needed some expensive repairs.  I trust Andre, but know he knows that... so I decided to play it safe and get an opinion from another mechanic.  He diagnosed my car with the same issues that Andre did and was going to charge me more for the same repair.   Andre has come though for me every time throughout the years.  His integrity and moral code are rare to find in a mechanic and any man in general."
5,Dr. Chawla has a very keen eye for detail.  Which is great cause I am a picky patient.   I needed to have some work done and Dr. Chawla understood all my concerns and got the dental work done perfect the first time!  Really enjoyed my time there - The office manager is a hoot too.
5,"First to review?! This place is a freaking GEM. Want cheap DELICIOUS bar food ? Screw going to PT's, this is the spot. My coworkers have been coming here for years (the insanely cheap \""taco tuesday\"" special is a staff favorite) and finally dragged me to this hole in the wall one day. I didn't expect much from the humble surroundings, but I was blown away by the food!\n\nOk ignore anything I've said about Philly steaks in other reviews. THIS my friends is the best Philly steak I've had in Las Vegas. \n\nPHILLY'S FINEST OUR SPECIALTY \nOur Famous Philly Steak Sandwich \nYour Choice of Beef: Tender Sirloin Tip, or \nChicken: Thinly Sliced Breast and Thigh \nIncludes Choice of Steak or Curly Fries or Cole Slaw \nPhilly $7.95 \nwith Cheese $8.75 \nwith Bacon $8.75 \nwith Bacon & Cheese $9.25 \nYour Choice of Toppings: Fried or Raw Onions, \nMarinara Sauce, Mushrooms, Green Peppers Extra Cheese .50\u00a2 \n\nSo I've had the steak, I've had the chicken. Both are HUGE insanely filling and really really tasty. For the chicken one I did marinara and green peppers.. MMM heavenly. PS - you want it with the CURLY FRIES. \n\nArtery clogging goodness at its' best. Awesome cheap ( under $5) lunch specials and crazy good Philly steaks. My official favorite bar food spot in Vegas !"
5,"Heaven, pure heaven.  I LOVE crepes, and their berry crepe was sweet, light, flavorful, just delicious!  The chocolate fountain was a cute novelty, and I'm still trying it decide if it truly is the largest chocolate waterfall in the world.  (Alaska's Wild Berry Products in Anchorage makes the same claim about their waterfall, btw).\n\nThe desserts look absolutely decadent; I knew I couldn't take that calorie bunch, so I satisfied my curiosity by taking lots of photos. (Cheaper and longer-lasting, I'm telling myself.)\n\nTheir mochas are delicious, better than your Starbucks variety.  I wished I lived in the Bellagio just so I could come here every day!"
5,"A great production and an even more amazing set.  I'll avoid all the nitty-gritty details since everyone else has written a very thorough review.\n\nIt was explained to me that the theater was built specifically for this show, which makes sense for why it just works so well!  With that in mind, they could focus on specific details, extra mechanics, etc... just for the show, and it definitely makes a difference.\n\nThe seats... I sat in row three, but I wished I sat a few rows back.  With all those \""extra\"" details in mind, a lot of action can happen around the theater that I couldn't always focus on.  Being a few more rows back would have assisted.\n\nThe show... 90 minutes, a compact and action packed show.  It did feel rushed in some areas, but it's still very good.  A quick critique of the performers, they were all amazing, but I did feel that the Phantom's voice was a bit weaker than I would have expected.  I don't know if it was an off day (or I should check if it was an under study), but it was just a bit below expectations in this one area.\n\nOverall... go see it if you can, it's an experience worth paying for."
5,"Mundo is a wonderful, modern take on Mexican food. The decor, dishes, and service (and price) are all a step-up in quality from a normal Mexican joint, yet it is still approachable. Yeah, you might feel a little out of place in a raggy t-shirt and jeans that a mom-n-pop joint would gladly welcome, but it is not overly stylish and cold, it just has a bit of modern flare. I have been to this place about a dozen times and have been satisfied each time. However, it should be noted that about a third of those times I have ordered the sea bass tacos, so menu diversification is not a strong point. But let that be a merit on the side of those lovely tacos that are just oh so hard to say no to. I am a sucker for fish tacos and have tried many. Being a connoisseur, it should be taken with some weight that I throw my vote for these tasty, over-loaded tortillas as the best fish tacos in the Valley. They are brimming with different flavors and a touch of spice. Do up the sea bass tacos and your good belly will thank you!"
5,"OMG!  Love Chelsea's Kitchen!  Love it.  First, you MUST have the Chicken Nachitos!  The Roasted Chicken Spinach Salad is awesome. This is what I order most of the time because I think it balances the Chicken Nachito pig out that prefaces the main course.  However, the Fish Tacos are great too!  I love hanging out on the Patio.  It's so lovely and the weather is getting nice now to sit outside.  Perfection.  The staff is great and the service is fast but not rushed.  I wish the owners would open up a  place in South Phoenix -- we are \""hungry\"" for  non-chain restaurants!"
5,"We had a hot water leak in a pipe underneath our house. There was no sign of water in the walls or on the floor, only a large area of hot tiles in the laundry room floor. Dave from \""West Coast\"" came over with some hi-tech sounding  equipment and pinpointed the location right away. After the tile and slab were removed, he promptly installed a new pipe. The service and experience couldn't have been better. My wife will be happy to have hot showers again! Thanks West Coast!"
5,"The staff is very friendly. I brought my car in for some breaks work. There was no up-selling and they were done about a half hour earlier than the estimate they initially provided. I cannot remember the last time that happened. They did a full inspection, and there were some suggestions about other work that should be done, but there was no pressure from them to have it done then. The price was far below what I was expecting considering how bad my car was sounding at the time."
5,"One of the best sandwich places in the surrounding 100 miles, hands down. Literally everything is fresh, delicious, and has a wonderful homemade feeling to it.\n\nThe atmosphere is fantastic. Its owned and operated by one of the most vibrant and excited individuals I've met. Highly recommended!"
5,"15 minute wait.  BAM.\n\nWe started off with the spiedini, which was delicious.  We did a half-and-half Rosa and Wiseguy, and let me just say, it was amazing.  New York pizza was screaming at me, bitter and betrayed, and I ignored it because I was busy having a freaking love affair with that pizza.  I'm still thinking about it right now...\n\nNot in a creepy way.  In a foodie way.\n\nWe ended our charming meal with some really amazing cappuccinos.  And did I mention the 15 minute wait?\n\nOh, I did.  Twice."
5,"Holy large portions, Batman!  I got the Big Gooey Scrambled Mess, a mix of eggs and various other breakfast meats/veggies and I was bust-a-gut full after only eating about 1/4th of it.  The preserves they serve with toast had to have been homemade because you can't get anything that good out of a jar.  The pinnacle of the breakfast was by far the fresh squeezed OJ.  I am a self proclaimed OJ snob, and I was about ready to do backflips over the deliciousness of OBH's OJ.  You get a refill with each OJ order, so you don't have to ration it to make it last throughout the meal."
5,"Love the name.  Love the place.   In my head, I call them Little Miss Sunshine.  They are a bright spot in a really industrial part of town.   They are a shining star for BBQ, in Arizona and Texas.\n\nYelp fans raved about the brisket.  I tried the brisket and was not especially pleased.  But I'm not really a brisket kind of a guy.  Give me the pork ribs.   Those ribs are delicious with the right amount of peppery taste.  Didn't require sauce but I tried it any way.  I think that if we poured the sauce on eggplant (I hate eggplant), eggplant would be my favorite food.\n\nThis is a Coke establishment  (yay!) with limited seating (just a handful of tables).   I really wish they would add a mac & cheese option for a side.\n\nI'm definitely bringing my Texas in-laws here to try it out.   Last December we went on a small tour of Texas BBQs and Little Miss BBQ can stand toe to toe against any of them.   \n\nSo really this is more of a 4.5 star place but I'm going to round up for the super friendly service."
5,"Surprise!  A martini bar!  Wandering around and looking for a place where my feet wouldn't stick to the floor and where I could enjoy the company of my friends, we walked into this unheard of establishment and enjoyed each other's company over numerous martinis.  I must admit that the dirty martini is the BEST vodka martini that I've ever had.  Basic martinis are strong drinks and for me, and are often difficult to enjoy without something to sweeten them up.  However, the bartender in this lounge made the BEST vodka martini (with olives) that I've ever had.  And she proudly commented that it wasn't the first time someone told her that.  She was right and she earned her bragging rights.  We enjoyed several rounds and will definitely return.  \n\nNow, if they'd only get rid of smoking in the 'burgh........"
5,"Teddy treats everyone who comes in the door like a best friend and he does not want his friends going away disappointed, so tell him what you want and he will do his best to see you leave happy.\n\nI've been a Teddy's customer for 10+ years ever since I first noticed his original location on The Plaza while driving home when working downtown.  When that location close to my delight they moved even closer to my house.  My wife and I get carryout at least 3-4 times a month.   Pizza, hot dogs; pasta dinners; subs, wings are all good..\n\nDon't go in looking for a gourmet pizza with goat cheese, pesto or sun dried tomatoes.  However, for what he does Teddy is the best in the neighborhood.  Thin crust with extra pepperoni and cheese is my normal order. :)"
5,"It's been a while...but \""I'm B-A-C-K\""!!!  Never in a million years would I ever crave a beet salad...yes you heard correctly!  Jasper's has an amazing beet salad, these amazing beets are accompanied by fresh mango, orange wedges, candied pecans, with the tastiest pear vinaigrette you'll ever find.  This salad is really more like a dessert :-)\n\nI finally tried the shrimp & ancho tacos, and I'm hooked!!!!  The right amount of remoulade, marries the corn tortilla, topped with cabbage, gulf shrimp, & ancho chili sauce...a squeeze of lime & it's just right!  My mouth is watering as I write...yummy!\n\nI only have 2 more, I promise...but everything is soooo good, I have to share!\n\nThey've got the seared AHI tuna...yeah, that's right.  I was like WOW...no way!  Amazing!  Prepared just perfect and so fresh.  I took my out of town healthy eating friends here and they just loved this dish.  Honestly, I'd put it at the top 2 of the choices that I love.  \n\nWhat I realllly like about Jasper's is that they have something for everyone on the menu.  If you're in the mood for a good steak, they've got the crab stuff filet.   A petite filet, crab and herb stuffed crosscut center, with a cabernet reduction bordelaise sauce, garlic roasted mash potatoes & broccoli...heavenly!\n\nAlright, I'm done...I'm heading to Jasper's!  \n\nWhy not...Tuesday's is HALF OFF bottle wine night..:-)"
5,Great customer service. Very attentive. No frills. No pressure. I had a tune up on my bike. They hit the splash guard with something whole adjusting it which banged it up a little bit. That was the only bummer from the whole experience. I will definitely go back.
5,Wife and I were glad they opened up here on this side of town. We immediately became members. \nThe facility is impeccable! The staff is extremely courteous and helpful!! We had a excellent time on the range and a great experience here! \nKeep up the good work!!!!
5,"Want to give a shout out to My T. on this one, because him and his wife Thao T. brought me here for the first time.  But Alcatraz is for locals too, so don't hate plaYa!!\n\nOne of my favorite brunch spots on the strip.  Actually I've been in Vegas for a little less than a month now, so I don't have too many brunch spots on the strip, but I still love this place.\n\nNice tip:  Also learned this from My T, when you're waiting for your table, there is a bar in the back in the outside area where you can hang out and people watch and enjoy a drink.  This is actually a crucial part of the experience here for me.  \n\nTip #2, you want a table outside.  Inside is a bit boring and I always see the younger crowds outside.\n\nGood food (a bit pricey, but that's how the strip rolls) good people watching and other views like the fountains, this place is cool.  I still would give it 5 stars even though I feel the food is a bit pricey.\n\nRecommendations on food are the salmon salad if you are gonna be a weenie and not want something greasy like me sometimes, or I would go steak frites if you wanna go big.  The fries are crispy which is too annoying.\n\nI have yet to try the onion soup, everyone seems to be raving about it!"
5,Just got back from Vegas. Was told about this place did not believe it until tried it for myself. What a  unbelievable experience!!!!' \n OMG!!! Going back in March to Vegas that will be our  first  stop from the airport.
5,"I've been to the location by UNLV, but this was the first time I had been to this location. The pizza here is very good. I got the pepperoni and the spinach, tomato and ricotta slice. They were both really good. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the prices are very reasonable. I really love places that do pizza by the slice, and this is definitely some of the better places I've been. I'll be back for sure!"
5,"As newcomers to the valley, we have been in search of good healthcare professionals. Well, we have to look no further for our dental care. Cheyenne Dental Group is terrific. From the time you walk in and are greeted by the friendly staff to the immaculate office and friendly low key dentist and hygienist. It's all good. Dr. Tran has been taking care of us and we appreciate his gentle \""chair side\"" demeanor. The appointment times are on time and they are always willing to see us in a dental emergency.  Thanks Dr. Tran and staff. It's great to have a new family dentist."
5,"I don't know what these Las Vegas folks are talking about, perhaps they need to travel out of the desert and cleanse their palate with soft water.Sorry to hate..but it's true.\nThis sushi restaurant is off the HOOK!!! I'm from San Francisco and I have tried many sushi places throughout California. NAKED FISH has a modern yet Authentic Asian atmosphere. They are open late for those who want to get a late night snack in addition to the fact that the prices are very reasonable. My friend from Las Vegas brought me here last year.. every time I visit Vegas to check on my house which I just bought and is close by, I am sure to pay NAKED FISH a visit. The last couple of times I've been here I ordered the Japanese Lasagna roll--- which my friend's and I call \""the cheeseburger roll\"". As weird as it may sound for a \""Sushi roll\""..it's extremely delicious! I'm taking my friends from San Francisco again when we visit later this week...and for sure we look forward to making NAKED FISH one of the places to dine at!!"
5,"Vintage, re-purposed, recycled and new.  COLAB is a shock as soon as you walk in the door - as you can BARELY walk in the door because there is so much stuff!  It's amazing!   From Gerber Onsies that have been silk-screened to older clothing that has been re-sewn into something a bit more \""today\"" while retaining it's retro feel - this place IS your place.  \n\nC.O.L.A.B. stands for Collectively Operated Local Artist Boutique.  Why has no one done this before?  Maybe it was a matter of rent, but hopefully with their tiny spot at .anti-space they'll be able to keep it going for quite some time.  \n\nAs of today their hours are W-Sunday 6pm-10pm and Saturday 2pm-10pm.  Go.  Shop.  Support.  We need more spots like this for our current and future fashion artists in Phoenix."
5,"This is a \""flagship\"" Apple store, as opposed to a standard one. It is singularly unique with bold architectural flare. It looks like no other Apple store you have seen.\n\nOf course this also means the narrow minded among us will no doubt complain about something - and perhaps not even come. This might be an additional reason to visit!\n\nPragmatically, it's a good store. Everything I've ever needed has been in stock. It's well staffed and I have always found someone eager to help (unlike some Apple stores where it's impossible to make eye contact with anyone).\n\nThey have a Genius bar as well as on staff \""creatives\"" who will help with projects and ideas."
5,Steve and Justin always do a great job.  Red Truck is the only company that I feel that I can trust to get the job done right.
5,"Great place for all alterations!  I relocated to Madison from Chicago and needed a place to help me with a bridesmaid's dress fitting.  The dress had a lot of lace, making the alterations slightly more complicated than meets the eye.  \n\nDarlene did a GREAT job.  The dress fits like a glove.  Woo hoo!  I will definitely be back with any future alteration needs."
5,"I'm not originally from Pittsburgh so I didn't see what the Manor was like before the renovation but all I know now is that it's my favorite place to see a movie. The location is much safer than the Waterfront, the tickets are affordable and so is the food! The staff is really friendly and one of the major points for me is the quality of the movies, the picture quality is amazing as is the sound. I will always avoid going to big box movie theaters unless I have to."
5,"We couldn't be happier with the service we received from Dr. Bennett and her staff.  We had found a stray dog at work and took the little puppy in for a check up.  It was late in the day and not only did Dr. Bennett see our puppy but did so in a kind, gentle, professional manner.  We couldn't have been happier!  \n\nOn top of the excellent service we received we also were not charged for our little puppies check up.  Unbelievable!  Great service all around.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough about a month later we come home to a surprised package.  It was a note from Apollo North thanking us for stopping by.  But the real thank you should go to Dr. Bennett and her staff.  Not only was there a note but also a chew toy for our beautiful healthy little girl.  \n\nApollo North went well beyond what was expected.  We are simply stunned by the amazing, caring, personal, professional treatment we received.  The staff took a personal interest in us and our puppy.\n\nThank you!"
5,"Dr. Archambault provides very professional, thorough, and personalized patient care. His approach is holistic. He is knowledgeable when to utilize other forms of medicine. I have been a patient for close to two years and I have referred several friends and family members here.  I have also begun to find out that many of my friends already are members of what I like to call the West Valley Naturopathic Family. \n\nIf you are looking for comprehensive,  preventative or care for an auto - immune disease West Valley Naturopathic is the place to be.  I have never had such control over my allergies and homeopathic remedies thay actually work to keep away my re-occurant sinus infections. I have also had the pleasure of seeing Dr. Jennifer Elton who took excellent care of me as well. \n\nIf you seek a family atmosphere with top notch patient care, look no further!"
5,"I have to say I don't know too much about computers. I actually brought my old computer in to Michael at Red7 and before even looking at it, he told me it was junk. I have had others look at it and they have wanted to dump tons of money to fix it. Thanks for being honest Michael. Oh, yeah I also got a new computer there, folks if you haven't dumped windows and got on UBUNTU, free software, you have got to check it out. My girlfriend is the ultimate cheap ass and to have to never pay for another $300 to $500 program, what a relief. Thanks Michael and Red7!!!! Awesome work!!!!"
5,"This little place adjoins the main restaurant, Vincent's on Camelback, by Chef Vincent Gerithault (sp?).  All simple and astonishingly delicious dishes.  I've had their salads, coq au vin, burgundy beef, salmon, specials, desserts, and not a dog in the bunch.  Service has been spot on.  Every time.  The atmosphere is \""French country\"" and very comfortable.   When the bill comes, it almost appears to missing a digit - it's very affordable.  The whole place exists for the sheer purpose of sharing the chef's delicious, beautifully-presented meals.    \n\nThe main restaurant is there to really showcase the Chef's true talent and should not be missed.  It's a great value as well, but expect to pay for a real meal.\n\nOne last thing, during the cooler months, the parking lot at Vincent's (Cmbk, West of 40th St) is turned into something like a farmer's market with a lot of delicious food served up.  It's very comfortable with a European feel and usually well-attended.  It's a great way to taste some great food."
5,I searched vegan restaurant in las Vegas and up comes everything in the search. Like Prime Rib Loft.... This place is an actual vegetarian and vegan place.  The food is good here. If that kind of food is what you like.  I have eaten at the west restaurant and every here has been good.  Some are for more extreme eaters but if you just want a good house said theirs is fine for normal eaters too. My wife and I have had about 8 different things and all were ok.  Several were great. Two were not my preference. But I tried and ate them ok and would try something else next time. I see some complaints about some of the more extreme meals on this site. All I can say is talk to the waiters.  The first time I went in the manager awaited on us and told me that the juice that I was thinking about was not what I wanted.  It's an old-time hippy interior design inside.  I will be back.
5,"For a lunch buffet priced at $10.00 with killer garlic naan and the best service I have seen at an Indian place, this place gets 4 stars automatically.  The food?  Well, it was simply wonderful and amazing and delish and oh so perfect.  I came here solo for lunch two days ago for the first time and found the place to be a hidden gem (to me, maybe not to others).  I'm sure the options might change daily for the buffet, but the first two things I tried were the only two things I ate - because they were that good.  The lentils with rice and the chicken tikka masala - can't go wrong.  For some reason I just wasn't in the mood for lamb, but it looked very good.  This place is good and you can't beat the lunch buffet price and food!"
5,Don't go anywhere else for cupcakes... These are the best. They truly are! -- I highly recommend the Drumstick! -- Even if you don't live in this area they are worth the drive!! DELICIOUS!!
5,"Honest and Profesional are just a few words to describe Dr. Boothe. I am 30 weeks pregnant with my second child and came to Dr. Boothe for hip discomfort. It has been so bad that it keeps me up all night. Since I started treatment, we have experimented with different treatment options and found the one that worked best for me. Because of his wonderful care, I have been able to sleep better at night and have found relief. From the moment you walk in he makes you feel welcome. He is very passionate and knowledge about what he does. If you are looking for a wonderful chiropractor call PROCARE.  Thank you Dr. Boothe!"
5,Love it!  The dipped Italian Beef with peppers is so good!  The onion rings have a nice light batter...get cheese sauce to dunk.   Get the strawberry shortcake to take home for later.   Busy place but very efficient and friendly staff.
5,"The Pinball Hall of Fame is one of the defining Las Vegas landmarks, providing some of the best entertainment and value in town. With so many different machines from different eras, there is something for everyone at this place.\n\nAisles and aisles of pinball machines, old school video games and all things coin operated can be found here. This place is literally like taking a walk down memory lane, bringing back memories of classic arcades and game rooms. If you are a fan of video games, it will be difficult to wipe the grin off your face as you peruse the selection of vintage and current pinball and arcade machines.\n\nThis is a perfect place to kill an hour or two and is a cool history lesson for kids who didn't get to experience the awesome arcades of yesteryear."
5,"Everything from the service to the food is spectacular!!! The wait staff make you feel like family and the food is like mom cooked it with love, but even better. Seriously THE BEST Biscuts and cinnamon roll I've EVER had. I'm a super picky eater and breakfast is my favorite meal so the fact that I love this place says a lot. Don't miss out on this place and if you get the cinnamon roll top it with nuts and raisins... you will not be disappointed! Don't let the decor and simple building fool you! It not be as fancy as Over Easy or decorated like Hen House, but it's soooo much better than both! So what are you waiting for? Get your Iowa Cafe on people!\n\nBTW, for those that can't stand public bathrooms, like me, you will be impressed with this one. The sink in the bathroom is beautiful and everything is very clean! :)"
5,"Emily's is actually in the complex I work at so it's very handy. The food is always so good and fresh. If you need anything special they can most likely make it for you. I've had many different items on the menu from the Salmon BLT, Grilled Cheese to the Ahi Tuna salad. You cannot go wrong with anything here!!!"
5,One of THE best poutines Montreal has to offer! I ordered the traditional with bacon & onions. DELICIOUS!! Fries are perfect (not soggy) the gravy ain't heavy or over salty and the cheese curds pieces are huge and tasty! Caramelized onions are the best I've ever had and the chunks of bacon was amazing! All this for under $10! I recommend to all!
5,"LOVED this place! Went here for dinner on a recent Friday evening. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Great wine selection and menu choices. The ambiance was very relaxing and comfortable. \n\nThe food was awesome. We shared the Cheese fondue and a deli meats platter. The cheese fondue was DELICIOUS!  Better than melting pot by a long shot.  For dinner I had one of the crepes, the presentation was beautiful and the flavors were amazing. My husband had the filet that that cooked right at the table - it was fun and delicious. \n\nMy only wish is that this little hot-spot was closer to where I live!  We will be back for more."
5,"Best bagels I've ever had. The end.\n\nBut actually. Bagels are such a simple thing that're sold everywhere, but no one really does them quite as well as St. Viateur. Also the place is open 24 hrs. That's freaking fantastic. High quality bagels at any hour of the night!!\n\nThey've got quite a number of flavors and options, but I honestly think the plain bagel is the best bagel. The thing about this bagel that differentiates it from other bagels out there is in the dough itself. While normal bagels need cream cheese to accentuate and even flavor the bagel, even the plain bagel can stand alone when it's being eaten here. It's got its own unique taste and god it is fantastic. St. Viateur also has quite the extensive collection of cream cheese, toppings, drinks, etc and yeah it's pretty awesome.\n\nBut actually. Best bagels I've ever had. I was struggling when I was reading the reviews between this place and the other place, but I honestly have to say that I have probably not ever had a bagel better than the ones that I've had here. This is no exaggeration. Friends got the cinnamon and sesame ones which I think were fine, but you gotta go plain.\n\ntldr; best bagels ever, go plain."
5,We had the wild mushroom carpaccio which was exquisitly delicate.  Just the right amount of sweet and vinegar.  The sushi was quite fresh and the decor was wonderful with a nice view of the strip.  Service was also excellent.  Plus the people watching in the mall was an added bonus.
5,"This library has recently been renovated. The mural outside has been repainted too. There is a large Libraries 4 youth section with plasma screen and games consols. At the back is a really nice kids section. there are of course, books, magazines and public acess computers. The library staff are great and they run books for babies, library link snd other events on a regular basis. Its a great pity that they are only open part-time."
5,"This is the most amazing toffee I've ever tasted.  It's not hard or sticky, rather soft and crumbly.  It melts in your mouth and that sweet taste is like a hug on the inside.  I serve it at every special occasion and it's always a hit."
5,"One of my homes away from home, this is one of the few bookstores that seems more like a library than a store. Quiet atmosphere to read a couple pages of your favorite topics."
5,"It seems every single time I walk into this store, I get the best service.  It could possibly be because the employees see this teeny Asian girl struggling with a gargantuan 20 pound pile of clothing.  Anywho, the employees of the Las Vegas Topshop store approach me quickly and take all of my clothing to the personal shopping section of the store.  This section is separated from the other (normal) fitting rooms and it comes with its own private cashier.  Very awesome!  I take my time in the store, and constantly add to my already gigantic pile of things to try on.  They also never provide a limit to how many things I can bring into the fitting room, unlike most stores who have a meager limit of 4 or 5 things allowed.  I do tend to blow my load in this store, so the employees are always friendly and helpful.  :-)  One of my all-time favorite stores to shop in!"
5,"My company uses reliable banner for a majority of its printing needs. I have had large banners made, flip signs, mission statement boards etc done by them. I love their work always high quality and fast service, I can reach them by e-mail or phone the majority of the time and I get a quick response.  prices are comparable depending on what you want done. I made a mistake and did not proof read once and ended up with some spelling errors but that was my own fault. The location is central very easy to get to. Its a small business not a chain so I get that added care touch. I recommend them to all my family, customers and friends."
5,"This is a place that really helps a lot of women across the valley find direction and help during transitions in life. Whether you are new to the valley as I am or a long time resident they openly receive you and assist you. \nThey offer short term programs to assist with finding resources for counseling, education, car repairs & transportation, interviewing, networking, resume writing, self esteem & empowerment, divorce workshops, housing, entering & returning to the workplace, the list goes on. \nThey provide a clean, quiet & safe environment with some free daycare while using the resources at the location for all women, so as to minimize their worries and assist with getting them stabilized in the communities. \nIt is the best such program, I have seen in any city and a beautiful environment as well."
5,"First time trying Fix, not gonna lie it was great. The finger licking wings, adult mac & cheese, & the filet were on point! Any time I have friends or family in town I will definitely recommend."
5,"I have a big company moving so they arranged 3 people larry john b and Adrian.  These guys really come on time. And they did a good package job. The only thing I want to share with other people who looking for moving company is that we really need to plan before moving. Otherwise when I unload the stuff. I do not even know where to unload. But luckily, these guys are friendly and patient. :)"
5,"This place is the real deal and worth going out to downtown henderson just to go to. I've only been once, but everything I ordered was delicious and exactly like the bakeries back home in New York. \n\nThe woman working the counter was really knowledgeable and helpful as well, which is a huge plus for me at any business. I will definitely be back."
5,"The only reason to drink coffee is if I'm all stopped-up from my wife's pot roast. Otherwise I steer clear of coffee and caffeine related products.\n\nFortuitously however, I discovered another reason to like coffee, and did so at Starbucks yesterday.\nTheir trenta sized cup.\n\nIt was a great Sunday dinner...pot roast as usual but now it was Monday morning and time to 'pay the piper'. I stopped at Starbucks on the way to work.\n\nAs bad luck sometimes has it, traffic was running slow that day...much slower than usual. I suspected something was wrong. \nIt was...the overhead freeway sign indicating a severe crash on the 51.\n\nGreat.\nI just drank thirty ounces of coffee and was now in the throes of a face-grimacing, bladder-busting event.\nThis is where the thirty ounce cup came in handy. \nOnce filled with warm, steaming coffee, it was now filled with something equally warm and steaming.\n\nWhether you like coffee or not, you'll enjoy the wide rimmed opening and the large capacity of the trenta sized cup. \nIt's able to contain even the most hearty of uncontrollable pissing events. \n\nWay to go Starbucks trenta!"
5,Not sure what's going on with the average rating here. I want to support all the veterinary clinics in Arcadia (I have an accident prone boxer so I have been to many of them at one time or another!) but...as spay & neuter clinic does just as good of a job at much much lower prices! Everything from shots to teeth cleaning to obviously spay & neuter. The staff is great the doctor is great. My dog is very sweet but she has a huge beef with vets and literally gets a little aggressive and they are so patient and understanding and still so sweet to my hazel even when she is pretty intimidating. They are completely honest too...not like a lot of vets or businesses in general who just want your money. I called about having hazels teeth cleaned bc get breath got rank all of a sudden lol and when I called the girl told me honestly a 2 yr old large breed dog...I highly doubt she needs her teeth cleaned. Small dogs & old dogs yes but you really don't need to spend the cash on her just get her some breath stuff from anywhere and some rawhides. So if you need anything for your cat or dog outside of an emergency visit take them to as spay & neuter (unless you have a bottomless wallet of course!).
5,Thank you again Yelp! Would never have found this place otherwise. We loved our Sunday Breakfast here. It is a very cozy little cafe that has a nice European feel to it. \n\nI believe they have the best scrambled eggs I have ever had in Arizona. The coffee is hot and tasty AND refilled frequently : )\n\nAnd can't forget to say that the staff are wonderful. Could not ask for better service....and they were all so happy!
5,"I just have two words... Pho Phriday\n\nThe boys from the office and I have been coming here for a couple years now... every Phriday... we get a diet Pepsi and the chicken pho with extra noodles (add $1). \n\nIf they didn't have Scottsdale rent, the pho might be a dollar or two less, but gall-dangit I can get good pho in Scottsdale and I don't give a shank about the price!!!\n\nI don't even need a menu any more. You might want to try something else, but if you need a pho phix - and you know who you are - stop in, seat yourself, and get into some love... \n\n\""I'll take the pho, extra noodles, diet pepsi.\"" \n\nSnap.\n\nPS have a pressed coffee if you feel sassy."
5,"I mean, it's sort of beating a dead horse at this point to talk about how amazing Pamela's is, but I cannot help myself. Breakfast has long been my favorite meal of the day--I can't live without it and I'm cranky when I don't eat something more substantial than cereal or a muffin. That being said, I demand a lot from my breakfast restaurants, and I'd be willing to say that Pamela's is my current favorite for BEST BREAKFAST EVER! Strong statement, but a very strong contender. \n\nI went here with a group of 3 at 9:30am on a weekday, so it was easy to get seated and the staff was efficient. We immediately asked our waiter for recommendations so that we could all share the best stuff on the menu, and he was dead-on with all of the items. We got:\n\nStrawberry Crepe Hotcakes--hands down the best pancakes I've ever had.\n\nTex Mex Omelet with Chorizo--delicious!\n\nEgg White with a side of Ham and Lyonnaise potatoes--perfectly cooked eggs, amazing homemade ham, and the Lyonnaise potatoes were exactly what breakfast potatoes should be: well-seasoned, a balance of moist and crunchy, and not just an afterthought.\n\nI wish that Pittsburgh was not so far away so I could enjoy Pamela's more often, but rest assured I'll be stopping by any time I'm back!"
5,Amazing food. I got the Beef Noodle Soup and it was delicious. I would definitely come back to this place and my gf is thai and she also liked it.
5,"There's something abut this location that I love.  The food is always tastier.  The portions are always larger.  The staff are always friendlier.  The architecture is more unique than other locations.    \n\nMaybe it's more appealing because I typically stop by this Chipotle after hitting the gym, when I'm absolutely famished.  Yet again, maybe the food's just made with more love.  (Not that I've ever had a bad meal at Chipotle...)  I'll gladly drive a little out of the way to dine at this location.\n\nRight now I'm hooked on the chicken salad.  I'm very picky about my toppings and  they're always very accommodating.  Side of brown rice?  Check.  Separate containers of two salsas?  No problem.  A teensy bit of cheese?  You got it!  True Chipotle consistency, with a little bit more pizzazz."
5,"This place is awesome! Great prices, great food. They always remember me and set a plate of spring rolls in front of me as soon as I sit down. Great pad-thai and seafood soup."
5,"Awesome as usual. This was my 5th time back and every single time it was amazing! Service was great! We came for a bachelor party and had a party of 23 guys, which you can imagine could get out of hand. They put us in a private room and took the best care of us! We got there late around 10pm and the kitchen closed at 10:30 but that didn't stop them from taking care of us and we never felt rushed. We left around midnight and there was no one left in the place except for us. If your looking for a great dinner this is the spot of the strip!"
5,"Favorite Pho in the phoenix area so far.  \nGreat, tender meat in my pho chin nam (#8).\nI see they also have bun bo hue on the menu so I'll have to try that sometime soon.    \nNom nom.\n\nFriendly staff.\n\nSee ya there!"
5,"Go here all the time for dates. The service is nice. The inside dinning area is also very nice. The outside is great, right on mill! The calzones are my favorite as you can build your own putting your own ingredients inside and they're also pretty big so you can have leftovers the next day!"
5,"One of my all-time favorite aquariums...second only to Monterey Bay.  Plenty of sharks and predatory fish too.  Steinhart Aquarium at the Academy of Sciences in SF should be ashamed.  They went from one of the best to one of the worst.  Anyone who says Shark Reef is a small aquarium should go see that one in SF to see what small really is.\n\nI think it's fantastic that with all the glitz and glamour of Vegas, Mandalay Bay saw the bigger picture and equipped their hotel with a killer aquarium.  A nice and refreshing change of pace when visiting Vegas.  Sunken pirate galleon tank is my favorite with the ominous looking sand sharks swimming about in dimly lit waters.  \n\nPlenty of sharks and pirahnas...I smile when I think of some people I've love to drop into those tanks.  This place rocks!"
5,"I have had thai basil both in house and as take out. since i live right next to it, i am not sure how it stands up to long distance travel, but, i have always been happy with it when i got it home. \n\nfor appetizers, try the fresh rolls, they are one of the better ones i have had in tempe. the spring rolls are also yummy, crisp and fresh tasting. \n\nif you ever have a craving for a strange soup that will clear anything out of your head, be it hangover or sinus infection, try the tom yum. its a spicy lemongrass broth soup with huge chunks of onion, mushrooms, and choice of meat or tofu. I love it with the beef. It is more than a full portion of soup, even if you share it, so come hungry. \n\nthe pad thai, another classic choice, is tangy, sweet, and has a kick of spice that is just right. most places seem to use a peanut butter based sauce, but thai basil uses a nice tamarind based sauce and only garnish with peanuts, which are nice and roasted. tofu comes standard, but you can up the amount of tofu or add a meat of choice. \n\nthe prices are fair, good sized portions, and great atmosphere when dining in. the service was great, and was always friendly. \n\nand for the adventurous drinker (non alcoholic) try the green tea chai. its bold, refreshing, and makes you just say \""..hmmmmm...\"" but in a great way!"
5,"Yum yum yum! Mexican food has to me my favorite type of food and Arriba is for sure at the top of my list for Mexican restaurants! This is a New Mexican style restaurant with lots of hatch green chilies in their dishes. You can also buy them fresh from here by the pound during the month of August. \n\nI have eaten here probably 30+ times and they are always consistent. The chips are always fresh and warm  they serve two different salsas as well as bean dip. All three are the bomb! My favorite item on the menu is the whitesands chimichanga. Do not order this though if you can't handle spicy stuff. but if you are like me, the spicier the better, then go with this! \n\nEveryday they have good lunch specials. I like to go on Thurs because they have chimis for $1.99. For an extra dollar they will smother it with the white sands sauce. What a deal! And on Sunday they have kids day with a clown that makes animal balloons. And best of all, kids eat free! \n\nAnd if your a beer drinker they have a microbrewery too. I'm not a beer drinker though so I can't tell you how good it is. But the margaritas are on point!"
5,Ago is a great place for amazing food and classy atmosphere! \n\n Went with a party of 6 and had $200 in coupons. Waited a while for dinner but was given free shots because of the wait. Overall great food and service.... Not cheap have coupons!
5,"They are worth the wait!!!!! During the week the wait isn't too bad, but I definitely love that they text you when your table is ready! The location is nice you can shop around until your table is set, free coffee to drink while you wait. The food has always been amazing! And you wanna mix anything up always ask! They can basically put a plate together for you! The hashbrowns are to die for! And beer drinking friends... I recommend the brewmosa! So good!!!! Love this place and excited to see it expand in AZ!"
5,"I felt a great sense of welcoming in this store, they gave me tips w/o having to feel like making a purchase. Very knowledgable individuals"
5,"I can't believe it !!!  Just what I was Praying for , A Vegan house near me that actually taste good WAAASS UP !!  Nami just started new breakfast Items that are wicked good . If your close to me When I say lets go to the SPOT you know I mean Nami - Or it's sister  \""Greens\"" next door ....."
5,"Keeping it short and sweet because it is a Place to get wings. They are delicious. If you're in the mood for wings, highly recommend!! They have a variety of flavored wings & Beer on Tap. Definitely family friendly. A little on the pricy side for wings but definitely worth it!"
5,"My boyfriend and I stopped here for lunch.  Figured we would get something quick and then splurge later on that night.  We both weren't expecting it to be fabulous, however it was amazing.  They make the sandwich in front of you.  You create whatever topics you want on it.  It was the best sandwich I have ever eaten at a BK.  Even the french fries were fresh and crispy with the perfect amount of salt.  We both were amazed and would definitely eat there again."
5,"This show was my first Cirque Du Soleil show about 10 years ago. So this review is way over due.\n\nSince then I have been hooked on watching most Cirque Du Soleil shows.\n\nThis past weekend I saw \""O\"" but this show and KA by far have been my favorite.\n\nI truly never attend a show thinking of the story or plot, I just enjoy great entertainment.\n\nCheck this show out if you're in Vegas. Sign up for their fan club to get good offers.\n\nEnjoy."
5,"I cannot say enough nice things about Eye Candy. I started my work on a half sleeve here back in ... oh, 2004? Jason is the best! He's hilarious, and super nice. And really loves what he's doing. He sat with me for a good while showing me reference books and discussing what I wanted. \n\nAfter we talked he sketched up my piece, and it was fantastic!  Unfortunately, I'm not living on my parents dime anymore and I haven't been able to finish the colorwork. But as soon as I have the funds I'll be right back.\n\noops- i just found out they changed their name to black cat! \n\nSo if you want tattoos go to black cat :D"
5,Mike is a great guy and an even better Attorney!  He truly cared about my case and me and kept me up to date on everything that was going on.  There was no smoke being blown and was honest from the beginning.  The resolution to my case was much better than I was expecting and Mike has continued to help with the very convoluted steps at the MVD.
5,"Our first time here. We used a groupon. Everything was superb. My husband is very particular, and he said \""The best meal I've had in a while.\"" We had the Steve's shrimp cocktail as an appetizer. They were large in size and very tasty. A wood flavor. Flavorful and good texture. He ordered the rib eye. I ordered the filet tips and lobster tail. Both steaks were cooked perfectly and were exactly what they should be - tender, juicy and delicious. The lobster tail was succulent. Probably the best I've had. (I've not been to the east coast.) The salad is good. The bread is brought in from a local bakery - baked fresh every day. Great place! We'll be back!!\nThis will be a special occasion place though, as the prices are a little higher than what we typically pay on a night out. 4 large shrimp = $16. Filet tips and lobster tail = $35. 14 oz Ribeye = $28. The entrees include salad and a side of either fries, sweet potato fries or a baked potato. Bread and butter are also provided. It's a great place, and very enjoyable, we're just typically more frugal - unless we're celebrating a special occasion."
5,"Happy I decided to stop in. I was greeted and taken care of like they really appreciated my business. These days when you see a business who cares about their customers, knows what they are doing and does the job with a smile, you keep going back, I will. Thank you Jiffy Lube, Scottsdale for being there."
5,"I've seen many chiropractors all across the west coast. Dr. Infantino is hands down the best care I have received. I Highly recommend Platinum Wellness. He is just an honest doctor that truly wants to help people. I even called in on some symptoms and asked if he thought an adjustment would help. Instead of capitalizing on the opportunity to push an appointment and collect, he advised the opposite and gave me advice for things to do at home. FOR FREE."
5,Steak frites. Seriously to die for. I could live with not having the steak again but the fries were mind blowing. Friendly staff and tasty cocktails.
5,"Thanks to the Queen of Pittsburgh, Rachel C, for introducing me to this uber-cool coffee shop in the Strip District. First off, I would love to have a coffee shop in my city that has the open air/garage door concept. The beauty of fresh air yet ability to see your screen all rolled into one? I could work for days on end at this place. \n\nHighlights:\n\n*Tea Party: An order of the caffeine loaded Jasmine (delicious) tea comes with three cups - ensuring hours of fresh and warm tea. Plus in the adorable small cup it's served in you can feel like you're having a tea party in an industrial setting. If that's your kinda thang. It's T-totally mine. \n\n*Second floor/atmosphere: There is a space tucked away upstairs that can be used for meetings and the downstairs has an open and airy feel with tables that are spaced out more than most shops. What I'm trying to say is, can I please load up this building and business and bring it to Indy?\n\n*Location: I can't seem to get enough of the Strip District. It's refreshing in a rough and authentic way. Zero bullshit, zero putting on a show. From coffee shops like 21st Street to eateries boasting piled-high sandwiches and Polish borscht, it's all walkable and charmingly tucked away in this downtown neighborhood. \n\n*Parking: easy peasy across the street for only $5 or in one of the several lots in the area."
5,"Shanna was recommended to us by our accountant, and we weren't disappointed. From the very first moment we met with Shanna, we were impressed by her humility, ease to work with, and her attentiveness to our needs. She definitely grasped our wants and desires, and had a firm understanding of our life goals, which is primarily to travel the world. We're looking forward to working with her more, and fostering a professional relationship with her. Just like your doctor or lawyer or accountant, a financial advisor is not one you can just pick overnight, so we're excited to have found someone who gets us. I'll update this review as things move along."
5,Just had my hot water heater replaced by Aspen Plumbing.  Scott the owner did a great job.  Very personal and was honest.  Would recommend him to anyone.
5,"You can probably drive past 100 bars from the other side of Capitol Square to get to the Malt House -- and you should.\n\nJust \""Like\"" them on Facebook and watch every week as they update their tap selection.  If you're a connoisseur, you'll find something you love or at least want to try every single week.  I think they have 18 taps and something like 200-300 other beers in bottles.  Whiskeys, too, if you're into that.  Plus, Saturdays are $5 off 750 ml bottles, so you and a friend can split that exotic brew you've been eying for a reasonable price.\n\nThere are no TVs and no jukebox here, and when night falls, the place gets dark.  A few friends, no visual distractions, the best beers ever and only your conversations in your ears? It really doesn't get any better than that."
5,"Whatever you think about Pottery Barn, you have to admit, they have the darned cutest stuff for kids. Toddlers, little girls, little boys, big kids, 'tweens, and teenagers -- all could find the ultimate room-of-their-dreams here (And I know, 'cuz I've got one of each of them).\n\nNot that I could actually AFFORD anything here...\n\nBut it's fun to go in and dream."
5,"I have a rule when it comes to Mexican food: if the menus are in English, it's probably no good. I am happy to report that Mundo breaks that rule ... really, REALLY breaks it. \n\nMundo takes excellent (and fairly authentic) Mexican food and kicks it up just enough to truly make it a dining experience. \n\nThe skirt steak appetizer was served with marinated avocados... I was skeptical, but they were fantastic. My Shrimp Diablo was very well prepared and just spicy enough to enrich the flavor without overpowering it. In fact, everything we tried was excellent, but to be honest, it wasn't the entrees or appetizers that sold us. As authentic Mexican food lovers, it was the Mexican street corn (or Elotes, as we called it when I lived on the border) that really put us over the top. I would order them again with every meal, and on every visit -- and believe me, there will be plenty more visits to come!"
5,I love the mocha frap... the chocolate they use is so superior to Starbucks and the coffee itself is much more flavorful.
5,Best dealership hands down. Service department is awesome. Love dealing with the people here and they are all very helpful
5,"All of the employees at my work depend on JJ's for a quick and tasty meal....and when I say quick, I mean that they literally deliver about 10 minutes after ordering! The staff are always friendly & they have yet to make a mistake with the food. NO MUSS, NO FUSS!"
5,"My family and I stayed at the Alexis Park Resort's 2 story, 2 bedroom Regal Suite this holiday season. The suite we stayed in exceeded our expectations. It was very clean, updated and well maintained. Our suite was located in a very quiet area of the property. There was plenty of parking available with easy access to the suite. The hotel is located across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel and a short five minute drive to the strip. My family was happy because we did not have to deal with the crazy slot machines or hustle and bustle of the Las Vegas Strip.  The manager Casey Meyers did an excellent job at accommodating all of my requests. She was so welcoming and took great care of us. The customer service my family received from Casey along with the rest of the staff was wonderful and made us feel right at home. Thanks Casey for everything!"
5,Great theme ! Awesome singing ! good Italian food ! Worth the drive off the strip ! The food and the service is great !
5,"Out of this world.  I've had many a meal here, but never a bad one.  So what if it's slow sometimes? Relax.  \n\nExtra green sauce, every time.\\\\"
5,"Red Rock Running is the best! Josh was sooooo helpful in helping me find the perfect shoe. Mabel was also amazing -so courteous, polite, and helpful! You really get a sense that  these people care about you and the business. Its so nice to get real help from professionals who care instead of the typical shoe buying experience at a major store like big 5.I love the videoed treadmill - seeing how I run was great because now I know how much I needed a good pair of shoes. Ill be a customer for life! Thanks so much!"
5,They met my tight time line for two dresses i needed on the weekend. even called and gave me the time i could pick them up. very efficient and friendly bunch.
5,I went to many bridal stores before I was referred here and I am so grateful as they have by far the best selection for that special day!! This is truly the place to go for your bridal gown as well as accessories! Both Dawn & Annette were super knowledgable and put me at ease.  The customer service you get and attention to detail is far beyond anything else and I feel so lucky to have this beautiful boutique in LV!! Thank you Couture Bride!!!!
5,"Awesome place ! I use to drink regular boba tea but ever since I found out about this place. I fell in love. I usually get the STRAWBERRY EGG PUDDING & HONEY BOBA ice milk drink. It's icey, sweet & milky. The cups are super big depending on the size. You can always ask the guy there whether you like it sweeter or less sweet. \n\nCustomer service is on point ! The guy there is always super friendly & tells us little things about each certain drinks. He always makes conversation with us which is nice. \n\nI would say best boba place I've been to so far. :)"
5,"Fantastic food. Great prices. Nice locale.  Every time I go in, I always feel like they're making food special for me. Oh wait, they are !  I'm a picky eater, so I always deviate a little from the regular menu ingredients. I love that they can cook to suit my needs.  It proves difficult sometimes at other restaurants. But not at Asian Cafe."
5,"I am a huge pizza fan. Easily one of my favorite foods (to the detriment of my waistline). But I'm usually just your standard cheese pizza type of girl, so imagine my surprise when I found that I absolutely love all the different, crafty combos at Grampa's. The Goomba is absolutely amazing; the cheese, garlic cream sauce and fresh herbs are heaven in my mouth (it comes with mushrooms too, if you're into that, but I always leave them off). The Brassacre is also great; these two would definitely be the ones to try on your first visit. \n\nThe ambiance is also fantastic; a very urban feel to it, perfect for date nights or dinner with friends. \n\nTry it out; you will not be disappointed!!"
5,"Love this place for food and/or drinks.  The soup, salad, baguette combo is a definite winner, boasting a baguette that takes me back to Paris.  I never pass up a chance to eat here.  The kitchen staff doesn't always speak English, and I love an opportunity to practice my restaurant sspanish that I learned back in my waitressing days.  Always a fun crowd in the bar with cute bartenders, I spent most of Halloween weekend here.  5 stars."
5,"I was placing Line Thai as my second choice for a while, but they are starting to tie for my first.  We went on a whim the other night and had their phad Thai for the first time, it is the best I have had.  We also ordered our usual Thai fried rice, and it was as AMAZING as ever!!  I have also had the yellow curry many times and it is great, as well as the pork dumpling soup and it is great also.  Their Thai tea is wonderful! Also the service is always wonderful!"
5,"Bi\u00e8res - L'une des meilleurs en ville! Dans la cat\u00e9gorie des micro-brasseries, dieu du ciel est l'un des meilleurs dans la r\u00e9gion. Innovatrices, leurs bi\u00e8res refl\u00e8tent merveilleusement les tendances saisonni\u00e8res et sont pour tous les go\u00fbts. Les meilleurs moments, quant \u00e0 moi, sont au printemps et \u00e0 l'automne, lorsque les \u00ab solstices \u00bb sont brass\u00e9s. \u00c9galement, le menu change r\u00e9guli\u00e8re pour offrir une grande vari\u00e9t\u00e9 de bi\u00e8res.  \n\nService - tr\u00e8s acceptable. Il est n\u00e9cessaire d'accrocher les serveuses \u00e0 l'occasion afin d'attirer leur attention, mais consid\u00e9rant les acrobaties qu'elles doivent effectuer entre les chaises et les gens debout, j'en conviens qu'elles doivent regarder o\u00f9 elles marchent. Les serveuses connaissent tr\u00e8s bien les bi\u00e8res aussi. \n\nAmbiance - L'endroit est minuscule, et il est difficile de s'y trouver un trou. Par contre, l'ambiance est tr\u00e8s d\u00e9contract\u00e9e et les gens y sont tr\u00e8s heureux. Peut-\u00eatre pas id\u00e9al pour les gens claustrophobes."
5,"Holy crud was this place AMAZING!!!!!! It came highly recommended, and we happened to get lucky with a groupon. Our server was so nice and great at making suggestions! Our favorite was the foul dip over hummus (not even on the menu). We came home with a ton of food. My boyfriend, who didn't like hummus before he went there, wanted to bathe in the Jerusalem salad is was so good!! We cannot wait to go back!"

5,"STK is located in the Cosmopolitan. It is so delicious!  If you're looking for a good place to eat and don't mind spending the money, try this place out. \n\nAfter you order your food, they bring out some house bread which was pretty good. For appetizer, I shared the Tuna tartare. It was so good but the portion is pretty small.  It's good to share maybe with 1 other person. I shared the bone in rib steak (20 oz) and good thing I shared because both me and my sister couldn't even finish our own half!  The steak was sooo good. It was so flavorful without a topping or sauce. It was charred perfectly. Probably one of the best steaks I've eaten.  We also ordered the trio mac n cheese which was off the menu. It was regular mac n cheese, lobster, and truffle. This was good enough for 4 people. My favorite was the truffle mac n cheese.  We also shared the Brussels sprouts with bacon, also off the menu, and it was delicious. Just an FYI, the trio mac n cheese is $55. \n\nWe also got drinks which were on the pricey side. \n\nService was on point. Our server was really nice and the food came out quick."
5,"Would definitely recommend! I have been here for numerous work lunches with coworkers and it is always a treat. Known for their burgers, I enjoy their fries even more. You can get cinnamon sweet potato fries, spicy fries, rosemary and garlic fries, or regular salt and pepper fries. Cinnamon sweet potato fries are my favorite, the spicy fries a close second."
5,"I brought my family back to Biaggio's last night for another taste- since I was craving the meatballs.\nAs expected, we were served tons of fantastic food and the ultimate compliment of the night was that my skinny, picky eater daughter are 3 garlic knots, a slice of pizza, 2 meatballs and a cannoli.  My nephew was a little less than well behaved and still rewarded with a cookie at the finish of his meal :)  The really do treat you and feed you like family.\nGo there (and get some extra marinara to put it on absolutely anything!)1q"
5,"Been to Vegas since I was a small toddler and even for my brother, Las Vegas has sure changed in many ways. I have stayed in many casino and resorts, and the Palazzo is definitely the resort to stay at. We have been a loyal customer since the Venetian opened, then the Venezia, and now the Palazzo. I feel the Palazzo is better than the Venetian (after the venetian had remodeled). When I am at the Palazzo, I feel a bit of the Venezia Tower is there. The casino on the lower floor is very airy and I feel comfortable gambling here. Its definitely more comfortable than the Venetian. I feel the Venetian has changed and it's very crowded and warm there. The Palazzo is very laid-back and easy going. I love the ambience of what the Palazzo has to offer. The restaurants also bring a great vibe. I love eating at the grand lux cafe at the palazzo rather than the venetian. The palazzo is a great casino, overall. It surpasses the Venetian."
5,"Never stayed at the hotel, but have had many an infamous night at club Mix.  An incredible view of the strip, with great music, and a variety of tasty and expensive drinks.  If you have the cash, you're going to have an incredible time.  \n\nThe last two times I went to Vegas for work, my coworkers and I partied hard at this spot.  Fortunately, my supervisor used his company card to cover the excessive amount of beverages and bottle service that were ordered.  There's a great breakfast restaurant on your way out of the hotel, which is the perfect place to chow down before that cab ride home you're not going to remember."
5,"This place rocks! It's as close as you're gonna get to a WC this side of the Mississippi and in my opinion its much better!\n\nThe sliders are perfectly cooked with all the fixings, taste amazing, and bring that mid-west experience of sitting at the slider joint trying to eat 2 dozen at a time. I wish I could tell you more about the other menu items, other than their fantastic homemade milkshakes, but every time I get here its a toss-up on the single or double cheese sliders.\n\nIt's a Chi-Town sports themed sit-down type place with old-school booths and a hometown feel.\n\nThe only negative I have on this place is parking, but I usually get there early to avoid the rush, you can park on the side street too.\n\nIt takes every ounce of restraint not to stop here when I drive past, do yourself a favor and stop in."
5,"The goods.  The absolute, gyro goods.\n\nI needed a gyro.  I found this joint.  I got a gyro.  I am happy.\n\nSeriously, I don't know about anything else they serve, but the gyros are top tier.  Chicago worthy.  Chocked full of meat and sauce and onions and tomato.  The pita was even good.  Heck, the paper they wrapped it in even tasted good...I mean, uhm...\n\nAnyway, the service was good.  The inside is a joint.  The outside is a joint with joint-like parking.  Next to it is the 'licka' sto' so you can buy some Flamin' Hot chips to go with your gyro.  The only way to eat.\n\nThe price is right, too.  My gyro was only $4.60, which is a whole dollar less than my usual gyro spot.  I saw a slider on the dollar menu (you don't usually see dollar menus in places like this) that I will have to partake of.  \n\nI would put my name on their gyros anytime, and I fully recommend this place for it.  If you've never been here before, keep an eye peeled for it or you'll pass it up.  Its on the corner of Osborn and 24th...next to the brake/tune up place."
5,I think I eat here at least 3 times during every Vegas trip. It's especially helpful that they are open 24 hours which is perfect for drunk munchies at 3..4...5 AM. \n\nLove the toasted soft bread and how the sandwiches are consistent. I personally like the classic Earl's Club but I haven't tried a bite of one yet that wasn't good.\n\nBeware that some pools don't let you bring your leftover food inside! So instead of sacrificing half of your sandwich to the trash you better eat the whole thing asap.
5,"Steak N Shake is one of my favorite places to eat when I'm tour in the South, so when I find out one was coming to Vegas, I was absolutely thrilled. I decided to wait a few days til the opening crowds had died down, but when my friend and I arrived at 10pm last night the place was still very busy. \n\nMy friend had the Steak Frank and fries while I ordered a mint cookies n cream milkshake. David loved the dog, said it was one of the best he'd ever had. The minute they set it down just the smell of it told you it was a REAL all-beef dog. \n\nMy shake took a while to come out (like I said, the place was busy) but when it arrived it didn't disappoint. Perfectly mixed (not runny but not so thick you have to wait to drink it). \n\nEverything on the menu is reasonably priced (4 bucks for a HUGE triple burger and fries, \""shooters\"" for 89 cents apiece) You will spend a little LESS than you would spend eating at McDonald's and get food that is 100x as good. Not to mention, during the week they have a Happy Hour from 2-4pm where shakes are half price.\n\nMy one and only complaint is that the location isnt 24 hours. Im hoping that this will be changed soon because I know for a fact they would be slammed at any hour of the day now that the word is out.\n\nSo glad to have SnS in Vegas!"
5,"Had lunch here and we loved it!!! Service was excellent!!! We where immediately greeted and shown to a table. Our waiter came right over and explained/walked us over to the service area. Very, very nice young man his name was Dannon. Meats,veggies,condiments and sauces where great!!! Dessert and drinks great!!!! Price was reasonable for great service, and a full belly!!!"
5,"The best place for coffee!!! I love everything about this place.. The atmosphere, the neighborhood feel, the baristas, and the patrons (especially the little Italian men sitting outside playing cards drink espressos). A huge favorite place in my book!!!"
5,"The chips and salsa were fresh, and they kept them coming without us ever having to ask for more.  I had the lunch special, Chile Relleno, with refried beans and rice, and all three items were fresh.  Can't ask for much better in Mexican food.....will definitely return again!"
5,"Let me just start by saying, I have a sweet tooth... I LOVE cakes above all else, and PS cakes are my favorite! PS has made me some wonderful treats for my kids birthdays and my own parties, Birthday cakes, lemon curd cupcakes, red velvet cake pops, s'mores cupcakes with toasted marshmallow creme, strawberry thumbprints and peanut butter brownie bars, even Gluten Free cupcakes (I did the GF cleanse diet once, only lost 5lbs) and they are THE BEST! Their cakes are beautiful with amazing details and Everything is always incredibly fresh and delish! Presentation is also super important to me and everything is always presented beautifully.\nBy the Way, the PS Sweet shop is so cute I just love the feel of the place. It is personal and cozy and everything you want from your Hometown bakery. I love that the shop is owner operated. Oh, and I almost forgot my favorite... you can drop by and satisfy a quick sweet fix and wash it down with a glass of Organic milk... How awesome is that!"
5,"I have to give a shout out to the oyster man on the sidewalk.  Wonderful oysters (seriously), friendly service, conveniently located (I don't have to shove through people in the market), and cheap.  At $1 a piece, or like 3 for $5, or 6 for $10-something like that-you really can't go wrong.  I've had two different shuckers that were both extremely friendly and conversational.  They shuck the oyster right there while you wait.  They have lemon, horse radish, and hot sauce on the whim, right there at the little stand! \n\nIf you happen to be passing by, stop and say hello and grab a fresh cold oyster!  I was trying to make it every Friday for a drive by oyster snack during nice weather.  I'm not sure if they're open during the winter, but be sure to check!  I brought an out of town oyster guru friend and he thought they were amazing.  Winner!\n\nAs for the store, they have a great selection of seafood.  Being from Houston, I'm used to the crawfish, catfish, fried shrimp kind, but much prefer the selection here.  It's a little pricey, but nothing outrageous.  I love the hustle and bustle of a seafood market and this place doesn't disappoint!  A slice of San Francisco in the Burgh.\n\nThey also have other items besides just seafood.  And sidewalk oysters!"
5,"Do you like Hooters for the Wings?? I don't I like it for other reasons!!! \nI like WING STOP for its WINGS!! \nThis place has the best wings, original hot is the way to go with some seasoned fries and bleu cheese that will make you feel like a little kid getting their favorite toy in the store."
5,"Just discovered this place today thanks to the stars given and reviews by you Yelpers out there and I gotta say that this is THEEEEE BEST place for breakfast in Vegas. Clean, great food at a great price and the friendliest service. Couldn't be happier for this find. Definitely a spot I will have to eat at least once every time I visit Vegas from now on. :)"
5,Western burger is to die for.... House salad yum!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Italian sub... Can't get enough of it... New chicken strips... OH MY! I love Zax... The menu is just perfect. I can go to Zax for any type of food I am craving. Always over the top amazing service. Charlie and Rosanne are good people! Try this place out!
5,Love this place been going here for 10 or so years it looks scary from the outside but give it a chance the owners remember everyone that is a repeat customer they remember if you want spicy mustard or not the food is great I have only ever had the buffet
5,"This place is quickly becoming our favorite bar. Been here 3 times so far and every time I keep finding something awesome about this place that makes me love it more. \n\n1. It's right off the canal and 48th bike trails so easy to get to from Old Town and Arcadia on bike. \n2. They have a nice 'backyard style' patio that you can bike upto, they have locks you can borrow and they have awesome bike decor all around that is also functional (bike wheels that are actually fans, bike chains that make up some lighting). \n3. It's a dog friendly patio (I counted 15 dogs last time!) \n4. Great crowd and beers!\n\nNever ate inside yet but the patio is the place to be, awesome views of Camelback, great people and dog watching and on Sundays you can enjoy their all you can eat BBQ for $15 (and it's a lot of food!). \n\nThey have a lot of my favorite beers on tap including an Orange Blossom beer by the folks at Papago Brewery.\n\nPricing is great on draft beers and I felt like for the experience and delicious food we ate the pricing is spot on. \n\nGo check it out and send me a message on what you thought of it because I think there needs to be more places like this around Central Phoenix!"
5,"Nothing but great things to say about this steakhouse!  Gotta love the stellar service and the great people working here, also the food is amazing!  They do something special with each dish, each and every time, the bar is classic with my pals, Tommy and Craig who just know drinks and know how to have fun. 5star stuff here"
5,"Brilliant, well stocked shop with knowledgeable, helpful and friendly staff who are proactive about helping you out, and provide fantastic advice to help you with your decision -- whether its buying a new bike or just a new pump or spanner!\n\n\n They also have a brilliant website, so you can research what you're looking for before you head into the store.\n\n\n My favourite bike store by far."
5,"For my birthday party a day ago my fiancee and some friends bought me a cake from Tammie Coe for their surprise party. It was jaw droppingly gorgeous, it was a gothic coffin cake with red velvet and cheesecake filling between. The artistic design and details were fantastic, it was something I almost didn't want to cut into! One top of it all it was delicious, very moist and full of flavor. Thanks to Tammie Coe for helping make my birthday one of the most, if not the most, memorable ever"
5,"I loved this place and would eat here almost once a week, but i went there Friday (5/27/11) and it said it was closed and relocating."
5,I love this restaurant on beautiful days for lunch.  Had a wonderful relaxing fun lunch on the patio.  Service attentive without being intrusive.  Good food and a great Chardonnay.   Heaven!
5,"I had a challenging time looking for a boa. I went to hobby and arts and crafts stores, they had em but not the color I was looking for. This place came recommended by star costume. Located in downtown lv in the arts district and parking is on the street via parking meter. All I'm gonna say is \""Boas Galore!\"" If they don't have a color you're looking for, they can order it for you (Will take  about a week). Love the quality of the boas,  I know where to go when I need a boa  :)\nOh just to let you know, these are in my opinion \""showgirl\"" quality boas, not the flimsy arts and crafts variety."
5,"Oh where, oh where can you find decent Indian food in Vegas?\n\nBollywood Grill, that's where. In fact, I would argue it's the best Indian I've had outside of the UK (where Indian food is as common as Mexican food in L.A.)  and may be a close approximation of India itself.\n\nThe menu keeps up the Bollywood them of the decor, separating items into Previews, Opening Scenes and Hits. And tasty hits they are, especially if you're a curry fan. \n\nI had the Chicken Karishma and it was perfect, served with a separate bowl of rice and the curry itself sitting on a bowl atop a flame right at the table. \n\nThe Trailers were worth coming early. The pandoras were incredible.\n\nHelps to also have a very eagfer and helpful staff who will help explain the items on the menu without any mocking or disappointment. \n\nOne of the better local dining experiences I've had."
5,"Like all the previous reviews mention, this place is pretty cool!!!! It's definitely hidden and I would have never found it without Yelp. I could only imagine how much business this guy would get if the location was different. \n\nWalked in and the owner immediately found me three pairs of high waisted shorts to try on. He knew what my size would be just by looking at me. I ended up with a vintage pair of Levi shorts. Fit great and super cute, great find and way better/easier process than going to a department store. \n\nA little expensive if you buy them distressed, he sells them at around $50. He hadn't distressed the pair I bought so they were only $25 which is a pretty great price if you ask me.\n\nCheck it out- you won't regret going in! Girls and guys clothing!!!!"
5,"I'm always on the lookout for sushi on the west side of town... and this one is a winner. Combine a creative menu, generous servings, and affordable prices, and you've got a winner here. The owner and staff are extremely friendly and talkative, too - definitely a plus!"
5,"I went to Purrfect Auto on St. Rose/Eastern to get my oil changed and they suggested I needed new brakes. I was aware of that location's shady practices and quickly declined the service. However, to be on the safe side, I wanted to get a second opinion. Professional Brake Service has amazing reviews on Google and Yelp, so I came in to see if I really did need brakes.\n\nMary, one of the owners, was working the front desk. She was very welcoming and friendly, making sure I got the best service possible. After the technicians looked at my brakes, she informed me that my front disc brakes were far from needing to be changed, and my rear drum brakes were still about a year from needing it. While most places would have no problem selling me services I didn't need, this place was honest.\n\nShe did recommend getting an adjustment. I had a coupon that I printed from their website, so the price was very affordable. On top of that, future adjustments are free, so I can come in every 3-6 months and not have to pay again. Free is always a good thing.\n\nIf you have any brake needs for you car, come here. Quality workmanship, great service, friendly, and honest. Can't ask for more."
5,Sign up and in went well.  I think the price is reasonable.  I had enough room to get into my space.  We'll see how things go when I go back for the first time to take it (60' of truck and travel trailer.\n\njjd\nCaptain\nMajor Airline
5,The spring rolls are out of this world. The pho is good. We went for lunch and had no problem getting a seat. Cheap and delicious.
5,"My boyfriend and I are regulars to this place! We love fukuburger so much it's unreal, probably one of the best burgers I've had so far. The tamago burger & the jazz fries is our favorites, we would take a bullet for that burger. We recently tried the katsu burger as well and it's also very good ! The environment is set for youngins like us, I'm not too sure if it's a place for older generation to eat at but I mean, the food is marvelous in our opinion regardless!"
5,I love the spicy chicken teriyaki low carb plate. It's a different take on Japanese food. The vegetables very good w the cabbage. Try it!  The yokisaba and the regular chicken teriyaki plates are very good as well.  Good quality ingredients and it shows in the final product.  Yummy!
5,"No enough words to described this heavenly dessert place. Their desserts selection is phenomena, which includes crepes, gelato, chocolates & many desserts. Every dessert is made with perfection, the detail of each dessert are hand crafted to bring satisfaction to your eyes. It looks so beautiful that it's hard for you to even want to destroy it & put it into your mouth. \n\nTheir gelato comes in many flavors and the creation is prefect as well.  The taste of every flavors is exactly what the name of gelato is called. Their sandwiches and pastry is also great, so is their coffee. This place is great for desserts lover & someone who has a sweet tooth.\n\nYou can also order online at jpchocolates.com :)))"
5,"Wow! This place is not only the best eye candy for anyone addicted to organizing their stuff in a fashionable and individual way, but he people that work there were friendly, and knew their stuff. I have an odd shaped closet and they had not hesitations of how and what we could do to make it work for me.  I would totally go back there when I buy my next home. Worth every penny."
5,"Not going to write a very educated review here - \n\nBasically we called on a Sunday afternoon.  They quoted us a rate and agreed upon a time to arrive the following morning.  They showed up ON TIME, not a minute late.   They did everything they told us over the phone and didn't charge us a single dollar more.  In fact we threw a little tip just because they didn't try to stick it to us.   And they were in and out within an hour.  And our water heater is back up and running.\n\nI called several other services and they all couldn't even give a ball park range quote and it would cost a 50 dollar visit fee.  Water Heater Pro's went above and beyond - thanks to yelp and a friend I wouldn't have known about this place.  \n\nVery honest, professional service - highly recommended."
5,"I've been to may steak houses in many cities, usually ordering a NY Sirloin. But I've never had a steak as good as I did at Botero this past week. I ordered it rare/med rare and it was done perfectly. Warm red inside with a seared exterior, perfectly seasoned with salt and pepper. The size was very generous and it was well trimmed. I just had a side of mushrooms that was enough for 2 or 3. If there was one complaint, wine by the glass was limited with just one Cabernet at $25. Other red wines were under $20."
5,"Definitely my favorite room for a tournament on the strip.  So quiet, secluded and smoke free.  Now if my 2 pair could hold up one friggin time....."
5,"BOOM!  5 Stars....   this place is awesome...  everyone in there handles their business with efficiency and confidence....  They know the answers to most of my questions about my account and if they dont know they ask someone who does...   Sometimes they are super busy, but thats the goal isnt it?   I have come to trust a few of the key employees in their with my account and they have not disappointed me yet...  Keep it up!"
5,"I love this place! Customer service is top notch and all their employees are very knowledgeable and helpful. They are always able to answer my questions and if they don't know the answer they are happy to find out for you. Prices here are comparable to competitors and in many cases their prices are likely to be lower than other places. The store isn't too big and it's just the right size to carry most items I'm looking for. Overall, this is one of my favorite places to shop"
5,The best cheese steak and pastrami sandwich in Vegas. this is a place for take out. They have a sitting area but its small and not to comfortable. But the sandwiches are great!!!
5,"- Super fast service\n- My waiter, James, was among the best and most courteous I've ever had\n- Food was delicious and perfectly executed\n- The potatoes deserve special mention as they weren't the salty paprika crap I usually expect from a breakfast place. They were nicely cooked with herbs and onions. Tasted amazing,\n- Pricing was reasonable as far as the better breakfast places go ($10 - $14 per dish)\n- I have nothing to complain about. It was the ideal experience and would gladly go back."
5,"I give this all stars because the food was amazing, but it was the presentation that did it for me, it not only tasted good but the way they plated the food it wasn't just thrown on a plate."
5,"Came here on a business trip, its a tough life. This hotel is FANTASTIC. NO smoke smell on the casino floor, the room was incredibly nice, the service was nothing short of phenomenal. We did not spend much time on the casino floor here as we wanted to head out and see more of the strip. \n\nWe had dinner up on the promenade in one of the conference rooms with our party from work. The food was great. I cannot say I have had better prime rib on the strip. We will definitely be back to stay here again in the near future."
5,"I'm listening to 2 Live Crew as I'm writing this so I'm feeling extraordinarily misogynistic. Forgive a brotha. \n\nThere are two things you should know about this place, and it pretty much sums up my entire existence... \n\nTake a girl here on a lunch date. She will see you as sensitive and intuitive. You may want to use phrases like \""I feel...\"" and \""When Carrie gave her assistant that Louis Vuitton...\""\n\nOrder the Mushroom tart. Or is it tort? \n\nIf you follow my advice, gentlemen, you'll have a great day. Good luck. And god speed."
5,"I have seen Dr Hurley a few times over the past year to help with my allergies and sleep issues.  He's been great.  A professional who listens to your concerns and doesn't just jump into prescribing medication or recommending surgery.  He explains what's going on and what he recommends for treatment.  If you don't feel comfortable with it, he'll offer alternative treatment options.  This is how all doctors should be.  You also don't feel rushed, like you're a number.\n\nI'm glad I found Dr Hurley and most of all, I'm glad he's covered by my insurance!\n\nReturn Factor - 100%"
5,The Wax Genie is my new waxer!  My Brazilian was so thorough yet surprisingly less painful than any waxing I have done before.  Definitely go and see her!
5,"If I could give The Cottage 10 stars, I would! This is one place in Queen Creek that I continue to be impressed by. The staff is out of this world, and the quaint little cottage is one of those places that you just *have* to stop by and visit from time to time.\n\nFor my daughter's birthday, we stopped in and got her a few little trinkets for her fairy garden. She asks to go back at least once a week! Though, I will say, this is not a place you should take little ones because they will just get into everything and make you a nervous wreck. As long as they're at the age where they can look without touching, it's fine.\n\nI ordered flowers for my wife for our anniversary, and even though I had no idea what type of bouquet to get, The Cottage staff put together the PERFECT flower arrangement! We were both very impressed. Plus, they got me major brownie points with the wife so... FIVE STARS FOR SURE. ;)\n\nOur flower arrangements always last a good week or two, they're always super fresh, and just absolutely gorgeous. Next time I order some, I'll take a photo and update!\n\nTip: There isn't much parking around back, and it's a beast to get in and out of, so park on the street if you can."
5,"You speak Italian to me and provide mouth watering, soul lifting coconut gelato with micro-chips of chocolate in them?!  I only wish you weren't 30 miles away...but I would walk in 116 degree heat to get there - for real!"
5,"My husband and I have visited Kickstand twice now, and both times we left satisfied and smiling. Both times we each picked the build a burger. It's just how it sounds, so I picked a single patty, with cheddar cheese, and an english muffin (toasted). I've also had the wheat bun, but definitely English muffin for the win. \n\nI've had the tater tots, and the fries, and both are good, but I think tater tots slightly edge out the fries. My husband also got the gourmet corn on the cob, but it just had too much on it for my liking (cheese, butter, salt, etc.). \n\nWe got the layered nachos and they were good, but a great tip from JJ was to get the pimento cheese fries. I'm sure we will be trying them soon. \n\nOne of the best things is that they have multiple ciders on draft. They also have Red's Apple Ale on special (or at least when I was there) on Friday, a 22oz for $3.50. Can't beat that."
5,All the hype surrounding this place is warranted. The Reina Pepiada and Shredded Beef were damn good! And the dude slinging these treats was super friendly and welcoming. Will buy again. A+++++++
5,"One of the Best French restaurant i have ever had. Id you order The Grand Plateau you will not be disappointedIII The lobster and Oyster were exceptionally fresh and tasty. Next come the main course Steak \""Bouchon\"" Rare!!! Truly an Amazing steak!!!\nI would definitely come back next time i am in Vegas"
5,"Te best cheese steak west of Philly!  Excellent fries and potato chips, too.\nUPDATE:  The cheese steak is even better with the new rolls.  I tried a chicken cheese steak this week.  It might even be better than the regular cheese steak."
5,"Took a couple minutes to get our chipotle burgers, but they were delicious. Sweet potato fries were delicious. I regret not including any pastrami as a part if the meal, but the burger was all I could handle. I'll just have to come back for some pastrami next time I'm in Vegas."
5,"As good as it gets (in Pittsburgh)!  I've gone back, and this time the service was really on point.  The steak was prepared *perfectly* and the portion was so huge I have enough left for lunch tomorrow.  The crab cake appetizer was one of the best I've had, and the dessert (as always) was outstanding.\n\nIt's a bit pricey, but portion sizes are reasonable and it's a nice dining experience.  When company comes in town, or it's hot date night, this is the first place I'll go."
5,This is the best club I have ever gone to. I went there for their pool party and it was quite possibly one of the greatest  nights of my life. We have hookups there so we got escorted to the club: celebrity status. It felt amazing to bypass the lines and not have to pay for anything. Everybody was in the pool splashing around and dancing. We partied till 4am. Such an amazing night!
5,"My favorite club on the strip! Marquee is where you go when you want to party hard. Great music, lots of places to hang out, good crowd, strong drinks! \nThe patio is tented in the winter and I wish more clubs would do this. Its a pain to get in, 5 lines at the front door, 3 lines upstairs, who knows what elsewhere. \nThe best video and laser show and the best waitress' (and costumes!!)"
5,"Our second time visiting this joint and loved it again. Last time we went for dinner. This time we did the $5 Happy Hour! AWESOME! We had an entire meal of the $5 appetizers. The beef skewers were the best! Sarah and Dave, the bartenders, were great and the food came out so fast! The $5 Happy Hour is every day except Saturday, but the word is that they may extend it into Saturdays eventually! The food, the service, the attention-it is all wonderful!!!!! We can't wait to go back."
5,"Smoke is easily the best casual restaurant in the Pittsburgh area.  \n\nLet's get a few things out of the way.  This isn't a Mexican taco place.  The flour tortilla is only a vehicle to get the array of smoked meats into your mouth. So you SoCal kids looking for a delicate corn tortilla can quit now.  Smoke is its own genre.\n\nYes it is small and sometimes slow. Suck it up, good things come to those who wait. They don't take reservations but here is a tip. Go put your name in and then walk around corner to Blue Dust and have a drink. Smoke will call your cell when a table is ready. Bring cash and your own booze. They have fresh margarita mixers so half a bottle of tequila is a good addition. If booze isn't your style, try the horchata.\n\nMy favorite is the rib taco. I liken it to a McRib sandwich with great ingredients. The brisket, chicken apple, veggie and BLT are all standouts.  One of the best things on the menu is the breakfast taco. Served all day, it is great anytime and you can add a meat of your choice to it.  \n\nOne of the secrets of smoke is the wings. They are only available on Thursdays and they run out, but man oh man are they amazing. Smoked then fried, these are spicy and awesome.\n\nIf you are really lucky you will be there on a day that someone has baked. The chocolate brownie with peanut butter marscapone frosting are amazeballs!"
5,I am going to agree 100% with the other reviewers here.\n\nThis is the BEST taco shop in all of the Vegas valley!!!\n\nCrispy beef tacos just like the taco bar in Santa Cruz-deep fried crunchy and wonderful shredded beef.\n\nGive it a try-it will take your breath away.
5,I hurt my neck yesterday and couldn't move at all. Instead of just sitting at home and waiting to get better I went and got checked out by Dr.Troy. When I left there I was feeling 100% better and was able to go back to work. Thanks Dr Troy!!
5,"This is one of my favorite shops! \nThey have really good prices on tea, and they sell coffee too! \nIt is the best place to get tea infusers, and they have all kinds of cute ones like ones that look like tea bags, and the one that looks like a monkey. \nThe staff is really friendly and they seem to know what they are talking about."
5,"Friendly staff, fun vibe, and somedays a wait. But thats what happens when your know for using local ingredients, being creative with them and hitting the spot every time to return for more. I highly recommend\n\n   -Baked oatmeal topped with brown sugar & milk\n   -Daily made from scratch bakery\n   -Smoked gouda Grits\n   -Weekend brunch special (posted on their facebook & twitter the friday before)"
5,"Deeelicious!  The first time my wife and I went here, we were amazed at how NOT busy it was.  Every restaurant in the Phoenix area seems to be constantly busy - every day - but not this one!  Each time we have been here, we have either been the only people in the place or one of only 2 occupied tables!  Weird!  We asked our server about this and were told they do a lot of take-out business.  We have noticed this to be true on our visits.  Ok - on to the food.  We have had pizza, pasta, entrees, and sandwiches.  All of it was good (with the exception of one weird chicken parm), but the best thing is definitely the pizza!  We love their pizza, especially the Amante Special!  It is very very good!  The crust is tender and sturdy without taking over the whole pie.  The sauce is tasty but not overbearing.  There are always plenty of toppings on each slice.  The sandwiches come in a close second, with our favorite being the canadian bacon one - yum!  My wife says they have the BEST caesar salad she has ever had - sometimes she has to get 2 to satisfy her craving!  I would agree that the salads are good - I generally get the side house salad with ranch dressing.  It is always fresh and crisp with lots of veggies.  All-in-all we will definitely continue to eat at this restaurant!"
5,"First time here!  I'm not a big sushi fan but I must say that it was pretty darn good. I got the Cali roll,  avacado roll and the double shrimp roll. They make it right there on the spot. \n\nI love expresso drinks and tried their White Mocha and it was great! This place is a must try."
5,"Have been following these guys for awhile now on Twitter getting ready for our upcoming, now over :( vacation to Phoenix. Lucky for us we were in town for the Scottsdale Art Festival and their usual Friday stop on 7th Street in Phoenix at Urban Cookies. The months of anticipation DID NOT disappoint upon our arrival at the truck. Along with myself, my wife and kids were AMAZED by the flavor and overall size of these Quesadillas!! We tried Steak and Blue and their weekly special which was the Carne Asada I do believe along with the chips and the Luncharitas in both Horchata and Mango Pineapple, all which made for a GREAT GREAT lunch! There was a line of people which was great to see for the LL Crew and a good majority brought back their Lucharita mason jars as you get $1.00 off on your next drink when you trade in you old jar for a new one, a great way to keep the people coming, and boy that they were, the line 12-15 people deep! And most importantly the staff...they are great!! Which makes it even better...we can't wait to see them again on our next trip. If your ever in OH-IO let us know :) Thanks again and thanks for remembering our Anniversary!!"
5,"Crazy Otto's is truly a crazy place.  Not knowing that this was a breakfast and lunch only place, we arrived at 1:50.  Closing time was posted as 2:00.  We went in, expecting to be asked to come back another day, and were going to try the middle eastern place across the street.  but the waiter told us, \""The sign says we're open till 2, so if you show up at 1:59, we're happy to serve you!!\"" And happy it was.  We even had a nice chat about the economy and how it is not economical to stay open past 2 these days unless you get a large dinner crowd.     The food was nothing short of delicious, and the decor is, well, crazy.  LIke the waiter said, \""check you licesne plate on the way out, it might wind up on the wall!\""  \n\nI had been looking for a good BLT for a few months now, and when I ordered one here, I expected just another typical BLT.  But I was surpised by the genoerous amounts of Bacon in the thing.  Most places just give two or three slices, but this one had plenty more than that, and crunchy, too!! A generous helping of mayo made irt all the better.  The order of Onion rings had only 5 rings, but they were huge, so it was like getting a large order from some fast food place.  \n\nI can't wait to go back and enjoy this place again!!"
5,"You know, it's really rare to find a place where you can tell the staff absolutely loves what they do.  I was in town this past weekend, and was a bit surprised that there weren't that many vape shops too close to the strip. I had a full day of plans and had to look for places that would be open early enough.  Ended up at I Heart Vape, because the other place that I had in mind was late opening up. \n\nThey've got a great selection from beginner stick batteries all the way up to some nice Mods.  Now, I live in LA and it's sometimes hard to come by certain clearomizers (specifcally ego threaded clearomizers..)  But this place had a good selection! Ended up taking home 3 EVOD clearmizers and some Black Mamba juice from Pink Spot Vapors.\n\nThe guys there were very knowledgeable, attentive, and incredibly friendly.  They have lots of plans coming up... very excited to hear about their DIY juice bar ideas!\n\nCan't wait to see what these guys put out!"
5,Love love love love love this place! They don't rush and they do a wonderful job in a reasonable amount of time.
5,My wife loves the cupcake cafe. I know when I am in trouble to get her a cupcake and it will make her happy. \nThe delivery option is great if you are having a party or event. \nI also enjoy the cupcakes.  My favorite is the coconut flavor. I
5,Grab a bagel and head to a nearby park. Eat delicious bagel. Contemplate going back for another. \n\nHad the everything with salmon and cream cheese. Delicious!
5,"Everytime we drive in from Tucson, we stop here! It's so good! Large portions! The sides are all tasty! We've never had a bad experience coming to Rudy's. Plus it's nice to get a cute little BlueBell ice cream in our way out for dessert. Did I mention how tasty their bbq sauce is?... It's so yummy!!!\nOh ya, and I love the large clean up sink for after!"
5,"I just started at this school and I absolutely love it! Everyone there is so warm and friendly and the instructors are amazing. The building in itself is beautiful. Everything is so clean and modern, and of course with the Aveda products the school smells wonderful! If you are looking to go to get into a cosmetology program I highly recommend checking out the Aveda institute you won't be disappointed!"
5,"If you want a great, big sandwich, this is the place to go! They are friendly, fast and the food is amazing! I recommend the slaw-b-joe and the capastrami."
5,"Every time I go to this restaurant, I receive wonderful, warm, and friendly service. The owners are often shocked how spicy I like them to prepare my food, and often are eager for me to try new dishes that they like to make. \n\nTook a couple friends from Japan there on Tuesday. Turns out the woman who serves our food regularly also speaks Japanese a bit more fluently than I do, so she was able to explain some of the more obscure dishes, and made sure my friends felt welcome. \n\nWill definitely return on a regular basis. Gotta love me some good Korean food.\n\nOh yeah, and they have a TV that always has some Korean drama on it when I go in. Nothing more amusing than seeing people crying or slapping each other like 200 times in 30 minutes."
5,"I've been here for about a month for work, and I am very impressed. I live out of hotels about 200 days out of the year, and this is one of the best extended-stay hotels I've been to. The staff is WONDERFUL! Really, from check-in to housekeeping, all the staff members are professional and friendly. I bring my dog with me, and the charge is a typical $110 no refund charge. \nThe food is surprisingly good, and the breakfast selection is HUGE. \nThe hotel is laid out like apartments, so you do feel like you have privacy. \n\n-good wifi (free)\n-good breakfast \n-great staff \n-nice kitchens (with OVENS in each room! Usually hotels only allow for burners)"
5,"A fun, laid-back bar where everything is worn, well loved, and comfortable.  The food is delicious and reasonably priced.  Went for lunch today.  Navigating the construction traffic was difficult, but worth it.  I ordered the Shepherds Pie (delicious comfort food!) and my friend ordered the fish and chips (likewise tasty!).  Massive beer selection, friendly waitresses, great atmosphere - definitely worth a try and I hope to get back again soon."
5,I can not believe how great it is to feel at home. I love this place. The owner is so knowledgeable on culture and current events.
5,"We love it , all bartenders are friendly n awesome people. I am here everyday with tara n the crew. Amazing veggie pasta.  If u see a big group sitting at the patio thats us having a great time!"
5,"All of the vendors here are great. They are here year round although the heard thins in the summer due to the heat. Everything from fresh roasted coffee, fresh baked bread, fruits & vegetables to custom length golf clubs.... What more do you need from a market!"
5,The staff were all very knowledgeable of the different brews and the roasts they have to offer. They were all super friendly as well! My friend loooooved the white zombie. She dreamt about it over and over again after we left Madison. I got the cold brew which was amazing! I ended up buying 2 bag of beans to go.
5,"The food at Dish is phenomenal!! I had a great experience. The waitresses are very attentive, and the food is delicious. The only thing I would change is the loud atmosphere. Try not to get a table near the bar. Also, the restaurant had bad lighting. I will definitely come back when I visit Pittsburgh again...."
5,"Holy crap!! Huge portions, outstanding quality, fantastic service! Who thinks to put red skinned mashed potatoes, homemade biscuit, sage fried chicken, spinach, applewood smoked bacon, eggs, hollandaise and chili cream sauce together?? This place,....and thank goodness they did,.....original and amazing!!! Soooo worth the 20 minute wait!!! Highly recommended!!! Come to the freestanding location, I hear it's better than the one in the casino. Atmosphere here is fun, a little loud and very friendly :-)"
5,"I love going to this MAC store for the full make-up with a $50.00 product purchase.  The artists are amazing and do a very professional and detailed job.  I've done this several times at this store for various events that I attend through out the year, and Effie, (that's her name) usually does my make-up.  She is amazing and the highlighting and contouring she does looks perfect.  \n\nIf I could afford to do this every day, I would.\n\nGo to MAC for full-make up with the product purchase, you won't regret it.  If you're going to do the full make-up, I would highly recommend purchasing a set of their eyelashes with your product purchase, because the lashes really complete the overall look. :)\n\nThank you, Effie, for the beautiful make-up I received yesterday."
5,"Perfect for starting early at your hotel. Easy access, open 24 hours. A little pricey but better than 10/beer at the casinos."
5,There are few times in life when you will be shopping for an Engagement ring and i was Finally in the market for one. I went to three locations prior to walking into Galicia's fine jewelry in scottsdale. my Prior experiences before going to Galicia fine jewelry were nothing but Confusing and feeling pressured. The staff at Galicia's were Amazing And needless to say on that day i walked out with the most beautiful ring for the Most beautiful and deserving woman in my life. Thank you Galicia For making my day an my life special.
5,"Only go here for shows upstairs, but love it as a venue. Sound is a lot better than most venues of similar size. Only thing that sucks is trying to find parking."
5,"I would definitely recommend this company. I spoke to one of the owners Jeff to schedule an appointment. He was very thorough when I asked him about the services included with a carpet shampoo.  The technicians Mike and Omar were on time, professional,  listened to my areas of concern, and guaranteed their work. They followed up with me the next day to ensure I was satisfied. Thanks guys! And I will be referring J2 Cleaning to all friends and family."
5,"Wonderful food!  We ate Steak Kew, chicken fried rice, crab angels, BBQ Ribs, chicken lo me in and sweet and sour pork.  ALL the food was fresh, hot and tender.  Al food is also made with NO MSG.  \n\n\n\nIn addition, the service was excellent (Mae).  The owners are very nice people.  Also, the food portions are huge!  Great job!!!!"
5,"GIGANTIC with TONS of stores! I was very overwhelmed at this two story MASSIVE complex of a mall!! I had such a hard time keep track of what direction I was headed, which floor I had explored already and what stores I was aiming for. Crazy BIG but everything you can imagine is here! It also has a large food court option with plenty of sit down restaurant options too! There's also a Harkins's theater, yogurtland, and much much more there, oh my gosh, I can't name all the stores! The list is too exhausting! But it's wonderful! Large parking lot to accommodate all the customers (which there are A LOT!) Fun place to come if you have the time to explore!!"
5,"I'm from LA where a small private board shop took care of all my snowboard needs--I mean, one of the guys even mounted my new snowboard rack onto my car and taught me the difference between Burton and Nidecker or NeverSummer (both much better boards than Burton). Support small businesses!\n\nNew to Vegas, I'm stoked to find the same care, attention to detail, and pride in Powder and Sun. After a full snowboard tune-up (trued edges with iron wax--not a machine once over), Tim spent over an hour trying to figure out how to fix my bindings after a quick patch job on the mountain and offered to contact the company for me to get replacement parts. His service was above and beyond any regular sports shop and he didn't try to push new bindings just to make a sale. \n\nPowder and Sun has my business and I'll recommend them to anyone for ur ski and snowboard needs."
5,As it's my last day staying here I thought I'd share since the reviews seem shaky.  This place is beautiful and has a great location on the strip.  The room is actually a great size for a standard king bed room.  Clean and nice!
5,"Awesome Bar food..best I've ever had..u must try the Popper Burger..it has cream cheese and crispy breaded onions..ask for the jalapeno sauce..its bomb.  They have great beer..favorites are their hefe, kiltlifter & ipa"
5,We eat here at least twice a week. You can't beat the low prices and good quality of food. I generally don't like Chinese....I prefer Thai but their food is so flavorful. I love the chicken with garlic sauce with chicken wings. I know it sounds crazy but the wings are good.
5,"Love this place, exactly what I have been looking for!! I have taken a number of different classes and I am hooked. I'm in my 30's and was looking for a dance studio that was not to serious, but provides a good workout (no recitals). This is a great place to get some exercise and have fun doing it!"
5,"Me and my son's favorite place!  Get the Ecuadorean tamales and seco de pollo!  Apple soda is great too!\n\nPS:  Expect slower service, because it is TRULY mom and pop.  If you go in with this attitude, you'll really enjoy the experience.  If you want quick, timely servers that ask you how food is every 30 seconds, you may want to try Olive Garden or something."
5,This is our favorite place in Vegas hands down. I have been coming here for 10 years now and it is the only place we party when in Vegas. The band is awesome! The crowds are always fun. I just can't say enough great things about Nine Fine. Anyone who has been a regular knows what I mean!
5,"Love the accommodating menu and atmosphere.. I can't wait to go back, I'm already craving their chicken basil.. umm umm good!!"
5,"My husband and I went in to check this new place out and we were impressed. We sat at the bar and were helped by Jessie and Brandon throughout our visit. They were both very friendly and made sure we never needed anything. \n\nI had the macaroni and cheese (without meat for me) and it was, without a doubt, the best macaroni and cheese I have ever eaten. This is not your boring, run-of-the-mill mac'n'cheese, but instead it has a lot of different flavors and the green chilies give it a nice touch of heat without burning your mouth.\n\nMy husband had the Pub Burger and couldn't stop talking about how good it was afterward. He had never had a burger with an egg on it, but he really liked it and plans to order it again on our next visit.\n\nWe don't drink beer, but that wasn't an issue since the place has a bar and Jessie makes an incredible margarita. Next time we might try the wine as well since they offer that as well.\n\nThis is a great new place and we'll definitely be back because I'm already craving that mac'n'cheese!"
5,"GLUTEN FREE FRIENDLY!!! We had a wonderful dinner here last night! WOW! We were able to sit outside by the water in Las Vegas! The atmosphere was so beautiful and it felt like we were some other place than the hot desert. The patio has misters that cooled down the outside temp nicely. When you first walk in you enter into the wonderful wine shop that has a great selection of well priced wine. You can purchase any bottle from the selection, add only 10.00 and then enjoy it with you dinner!!! How fun is that!? The service is top-notch! Our server and the chef had no problems with accommodating our dietary restrictions and letting us know specific ingredients and possible allergy triggers. They have live music, which last night was a guitar player. He was very talented. Off of the menu we chose to start with burrata cheese and heirloom tomato salad and the soup of the day which was pur\u00e9e butternut with crab, it was amazing! For our entrees we enjoyed the scallops with tomato and baby broccoli and the seared swordfish with red pepper sauce. The portions are a good size! We were stuffed! We cannot wait to come back to enjoy the other menu items we missed out on! The only bad thing I have to say is they need to update the menu on the website to show off a few new items that look wonderful!"
5,"We had a very specific need for an exterior door.  \n\nSeveral Home Depot competitors were unable to fulfill that need.  However, Home Depot had sales people that worked to find a custom solution.  \n\nThen upon the arrival of the door, much more that the usual effort was needed before the door could be installed.  The installer was an excellent person, his work was precise, and he cleaned up the materials left after the work was completed.\n\nAll this for a price that was more than competitive.\n\nThan you all for your efforts."
5,"As a new business owner I was a couple years behind on filing my business taxes.  Lizeth at iQ Taxx was very courteous to me with all my questions, and there were plenty.  Also keeping me informed on the whole process from beginning to end.  I am very happy to do business with iQ Taxx as they have helped me with mine.  Support Small Business :)"
5,"The dining experience is more than I'd expect from a place like this. It's like I'm dinning at a 5 star restaurant-- I'm exaggerating, of course--with people coming over and asking how my food is, asking if I need anything else, taking away my plates. Can I give you a tip for god sakes? \n\nI'm always impressed when people learn my name and that definitely earns points from me. Right now, I'm obsessed with their pan seared salsa verde shrimp tacos.  You gotta try them! I have horrible cravings for those bad boys.\n\nThey also make sure you keep coming back.  One time, they messed up my order and because of it, they gave me a card that entitled me to one free taco for my inconvenience.  I wasn't even mad or upset about it, but I wasn't gunna pass up a free taco either."
5,"Always have since day one going here and always will love this place.\n\nI was surprised that I have not been here for a while and one of the young ladies there remembered me, the food I eat and how I like my tea.  They have the best black tea I have ever had and for someone to remember you when you are only a customer is amazing.\n\nI highly recommend this place for food and drink as well as a great place to just hang out."
5,"Stopped by for my birthday meal and received an excellent steak, excellent service and a free desert.  The manager came by twice to make sure all was well......"
5,"By far my best dining experience in Vegas, actually in a while. They definitely deserve all 5 stars for the service, food, appearance and everything.\n\nService:\nWe came here without reservations and were told we had an 1 and 30 minute wait so we figured we would walk around and catch the Fountains at Bellagio show. The hostess then told us to come back after 30 minutes and she would give us a buzzer. We see the show and come back only to have to wait for just 3 minutes. We asked them to sit us on the balcony and with only a side balcony table being opened they let us wait for the center table to to be cleaned without any issue! Our waitress had a very cheery attitude and recommended us dishes to try.\n\nFood:\nWe started of with Duck confit and spinach with cranberries on the side and OMGoodness it was to die for! Like seriously the duck melted in my mouth! I ordered the steak with the caramelized onions and hand carved french fries and my bf had the seafood special. The food was well cooked and very filling.\n\nI highly recommend Mon Ami Gabi for a nice dinner and will be back for more duck confit!"
5,"I was actually hesitant at first to rent from this place because of the really bad reviews and low ratings, but I'm actually glad that I did!  Being a pretty broke college student/career changer, I rented from them during Thanksgiving week to visit family in South Carolina and mostly because they were the cheapest company when booking cars on Expedia.  When I arrived at the airport lot, the driver of the shuttle, Jim (hopefully I got his name right!)  was really helpful giving me directions to a nearby mall and back to SC and even wrote down the directions for me!  The guys at the counter were really nice too- They were even having a pretty nice conversation with the customers before me who were travelling from NY.  \nThe check-in process was pretty fast and easy for me as I had already purchased insurance from Expedia (where I booked the car)  and I think I got my car in less than 10 minutes after I arrived at the counter.   The cars available in the lot were mostly brand new (2011-2012 models). When I was driving to the mall and SC, I followed Jim's directions and they were right on!  I just want to thank you guys for making my stay in SC a bit easier and Jim for giving me directions to all of these destinations!  I highly recommend them and hopefully this review will make some of you people wondering if they should rent from them a bit at ease."
5,"I had to go from B to E, and it only took about 10 minutes. I thought that I'd have to change terminals but nope! Great shops and restaurants, very clean, easy to get around, beautiful gardens inside too"
5,"Our new favorite place. The kids that work there are all outstanding. Customer service is on target with this store. I have not been to others but I suspect that it is their corporate culture. The food choices are wonderful and even my husband who is not known for his desire for salads nor soups, now asks to go here once a week. Love that. We dine out 5 times a week as it is so hard to make dinner for just 2 people and coming here is a weekly stop.\n\nI have only one complaint and that is that nowhere to be found is a nutrition listing on their foods. I have asked and tried their website. Nothing. That is a shame"
5,"I love this place. The owners are great. I brought my family in there to try some gelato, and it did not disappoint. Everything is made from scratch, with truly original flavors. I had the sweet corn, chocolate mousse, and pistachio. Far and away the best gelato I've ever had. The owner Luigi, kept bringing my kids same flavors. They absolutely loved it! It's great to see someone doing something positive in the downtown area. Go check it out, I guarantee you will love it. They will have pints, quarts, and cakes coming soon. They are also planning on doing home made cookies for ice cream sandwiches."
5,One of the best buffet I've ever been to.  They no longer have the King crab selection at a reduced price but the quality of food is still very good.  I like the roast beef but I tired every station and was not dissappointed.
5,"Due to a flight delay, US Airways booked me here for the night. What a hotel!\n\nA shuttle arrived at the airport within 15 mins of me calling, with a wonderfully friendly driver, Eddie. He helped me find a place to order dinner from while the very helpful front desk attendant got me checked in. They were more than helpful and went above their expectations.\n\nThe room was splendid, with a kitchen, living room with TV, bedroom with TV, and very spacious bathroom, all with new appliances and remodeling. More than enough towels and complimentary coffee. \n\nFor breakfast, there were enough options to have three full meals! Everything was fresh and tasty.\n\nIf I ever get delayed again, I will be very happy indeed to return to the Hyatt House."
5,I absolutely love this place. It's always busy but I've never had to wait too long for a table. The food is great and the portions are perfect. Everything on the menu is good and the bagels are always fresh.
5,"Ordered from Eat 24 Tempe, and it was a great experience. Guy took 20 minutes to delivery our food, not bad at all! Ordered the panang curry, yellow curry (thai hot) and the egg rolls. Everything was certainly up to par and was worth the little research. If you like Thai, I'm most sure you'll have a great experience at this place."
5,"Sill love this place.  I had a pollo burrito and the pollo was amazing in taste and everything was prepared as requested.\n\nI cannot say enough about this place, the food is awesome, the price is right and this is a place I will continue to support as often as possible.  I love it for a quick snack or a complete meal, either way its amazing."
5,"Si vous aimez la viande, ou mieux si vous l'adorez, vous allez \u00eatre aux anges en sortant de ce restaurant br\u00e9silien. Le menu est assez simple et, du reste, presque tout le monde choisi, avec raison, Le Tourniquet, qui est la sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 de la maison. Pour \u00e0 peine 30 dollars, cette option du menu vous permettra de manger quelque 10 sortes de viandes \u00e0 volont\u00e9, que les serveurs vous proposeront r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le. En effet, les serveurs ne vous am\u00e8nent pas de nouvelles assiettes, mais passent de table en table avec une viande qu'ils tiennent sur une broche et en servent \u00e0 volont\u00e9. Apr\u00e8s le dixi\u00e8me service, il est fort \u00e0 parier que vous n'aurez plus faim, mais si vous voulez continuer \u00e0 vous r\u00e9galer des viandes propos\u00e9es, vous pourrez continuer! De plus, en accompagnement, on sert du riz et une petite salsa qui est excellente sur les viandes les plus s\u00e8ches. Un incontournable pour tous les carnivores qui s'assument !"
5,"This is such a great place.  Brenda and all of her staff sincerely like people.  The food is simple home-cooking, always lovingly prepared and fresh.  Service is friendly and warm, but sometimes when the restaurant is very busy, it can be slower.  No matter.  Everyone, including the regulars, is so nice you will just enjoy the atmosphere.  Prices are friendly also..."
5,"Well, this is just a delight. Our friend Heid works at the bakery so we thought we'd stop by in the morning before leaving for Boston where we were performing that night. Knowing Heidi we knew it would have to be a top spot and indeed it was. Great croisants, great little tarts, super European style bread (even in New York it's a real challenge to find tasty and healthy - at least 13 grains, please - so I can appreciate the real deal when I taste it). Even the chocolate milk was superb. We left happy but also sad that we'd have to say \""bye, bye\"" to our friend Heidi and the rest of our friends in Montreal. Herremannen dug the bakery so much that he purchased flowers at he florist next door in order to express his delight and appreciation. And we shall return for more chocolate croisants and fruit tarts at Boulangerie Le Fournil, in this stellar part of Montreal.\n\n- SL"
5,"Alright Monta, after 2 reviews, I gotta give you guys the 5 stars. As mentioned in my previous reviews, this is by far the best ramen house in Vegas. That alone counts for a lot. They put a lot of care into their food, which I under appreciated in my previous reviews. Yes, I still think service is sometimes a hit or miss, but lately its been great the past few times I've been here. Hopefully, this is just consistent and not my amazing luck. Also, they listened to their customers and opened up a new location in Henderson. I really appreciate restaurant owners who lend an ear to their customers and act accordingly.\n\nNot much else to say about Monta, if you are looking for ramen in Las Vegas, you've come to the right place."
5,"This is the best shooting range that I have been to.  Not only were they priced fairly, but the facilities to shoot were incredible!  We had a group of about 6 people and we were able to utilize a special skeet shooting range this past weekend.  The individuals that were conducting this special pre-dove season shooting were uber helpful and were able to provide key advice while shooting.  I wish that I lived closer to Phoenix so we could go more often.  I would recommend this to anyone of any level of expertise."
5,"This place has great food and most importantly is very consistent - no ups and downs. The basic gyros are fantastic, but I really like the Philly gyro. The salad is good and so are the fries."
5,"Yelp was right! Saw the good reviews for this place back in February, came to Vegas in may, and the reviews did not disappoint."
5,"awesome dance place! \nthe music was perfect. hip hop, pop remixes, some 80's some early 90's and my friends who are into techno even got to dance to their favorite song so we were all thrilled! the drinks are not cheap but what do you expect. We were four girls on the dance floor so we got hassled a bit by drunk guys but we found our groove and some cool people. when we got too hot from dancing we went out to the patio and the security out there found us a seat which was really unexpected and appreciated. i would totally come here again"
5,A fatty's paradise! LOL Great selection of greasy fare if you are craving that BURGER or FRIES! Its a little place on the outskirts of a shopping mall but it has a drive thru! Genius! Go for the ZOMBIE burger and pastrami fries! ALWAYS A WINNER! Never got to try the shakes but im not trying to surpass a 10k calorie meal in one sitting! Very affordable and great parking!
5,"I went to the drive up and ordered a dirty frozen frap, Iced Chai and their very own Apricot Croissant. Everything really tasty!!.......They have a wide selection of lunch and breakfast options too. My next to try will be The Gobbler which is something similar to a Bobbi. Anyway if you're in the area and in need of great Coffee and something delicious and quick to eat this is the place to come. This place is a bakery too can't ask for anything more from a coffee to go place.  My first choice over Einstein and Starbucks."
5,The best Tapa's place in Pittsburgh. Everything we tried was exceptionaly delicious. Service was very attentive and the place had a very nice vibe. Great martinis too!
5,"This is an automatic stop for family every-time we are staying at the Palazzo.  We come here for lunch or a quick hot noodles fix after a late night drinking. Their noodle  soup are very tasty and delicious which always hit the spot.  Love the fact they close late at 3am.  This was our first stop after checking in the hotel so will definitely be back after drinking tonight.  They also have Pho but soup base seems a watered down and not the best out there.  Some of my favorites includes Shrimp Fried Rice, Beef Congee and the Duck Noodle Soup."
5,"I'm not sure who's more in love with Tait, me or my 1999 Honda Civic.  Tait and his crew have been taking care of my car for the past 9 years, and I have NEVER had a complaint.  \n\nFirst, Tait is incredibly honest.  Tells me when a noise is cosmetic, or a cause for concern, and just how long I can wait.  Always upfront about pricing, and usually ends up being less than the original quote.  I have never had to go back for the same issue.  \n\nEven if I didn't love my Honda, I would keep buying them just to keep Hon-Man as my mechanic.  \n\nThe only thing negative is (and I've told him this before) - TAIT - GET RID OF THE FLASH WEBSITE.....I hate waiting for that to play out when I just want your phone number."
5,couldn't be happier with new ownership and excellent service. Had all of my girls nails done here and they're just perfect
5,"2 year anniversary last night...Tymn (our waiter) was GREAT!  Robert suggested a great bottle of wine (which we took one home too)!  My wife just told the chef to \""surprise her\""...which he did!  \n\n\nFirst Course:\nHe made a fresh spinach, heirloom tomato and walnut pesto with scallions and bruschetta.  \n\nI had a salad with cayenne blue cheese and carmel corn and vinaigrette.\n\n\nSecond course:\nUdon salad with honey cayenne praline cashews and schezuan vinaigrette.\n\nI had the ostrich with pesto fresh mozzarella cheese heirloom tomatoes. \n\n\nThird course:\nWild Mushroom couscous with walnuts and truffle oil.\n\nI had the Opah with a crab bisque and Udon noodles."
5,"Way better than I expected. I'm so glad we tried this place instead of going to BJ's again. \n\nI had an excellent meal here. The food tasted VERY good. The marinara, ribs, filet mignon, clams and mussels were all very flavorful.\n\nThe server was a little overwhelmed  but he had plenty of help from the support team: managers and bussers,  who pulled together well to pleasantly serve us a very tasty meal. \n\nHad we not been food people (worked in restaurants our whole lives) I don't think we would have noticed how slammed the server was.\n\nPlus they play groovy jazz music. I like it."
5,"GREAT food.  one of BEST veal dishes I've ever had AND reasonable prices.  Small family atmosphere but due to limited space, better make reservations.  Food like mama used to make.  Will be coming back here again and again."
5,"I come here for brunch on my final day in Vegas and it was the perfect way to wrap up my trip! In Vegas, I think this place is as good as it gets!\n\nThere will be a line... a long one, but trust me it's worth the wait.\n\nGreat food & great options! ENJOY!"
5,"Een heerlijke kleine winkel voor een goed belegde Jacket Potato! De Aardappels zijn echt groot, dus wanneer je weinig honger hebt, is 1 Jacket Potato echt meer dan voldoende.\n\nEr is voor vegetarischers en mensen met een koemelk-, en gluten allergie ook volop keus, laat het de medewerker(s) weten en ze kunnen je prima verder helpen.\n\nDe winkel zelf heeft wel een tafeltje waaraan je kan zitten, maar echt luxe is het niet. Beter neem je je voedsel mee naar buiten en eet je het op terwijl je van de stad geniet."
5,I LOVE this place! Came here with some of my boys last night and had an awesome time. The atmosphere was very sophisticated and classy but people were still there to have a great time. Cocktail waitresses were very friendly and helpful and no one hesitated to help out or answer a question.  Great overall venue.
5,I love this place. I love how every time I need another refill it has already been done. They have this chilli chicken dish which is little pieces of chicken covered in their special chilli sauce and cooked for long time to become delicious as it is. I have been trying to find a great Indian place for a while and this one does it for me. I love the service here and will continue to come back.
5,"Every time we g to AZ, Phoenix Art Museum is on our list of things to go and see. The changing exhibits are wonderful. And, the price is right -- you only pay a nominal fee for parking."
5,"As others have suggested, this place is an absolute gem. We've now visited for both their lunch and evening menus, and both were excellent. The \u00a37.95 three-course lunch deal is quite unbelievable value - I can't think of better lunchtime value anywhere in the city. The message is pretty clear: go soon, and go often.\n\nOverall, we said: \""Michael Neave was extremely impressive. The place has style and class aplenty, and the seasonally changing menu offers well-executed, imaginative dishes, grounded in showcasing locally sourced produce. I look forward to my next visit.\"""
5,"I want more noodles. Noodles, noodles and more noodles. Ramen last night was amazing. The chef can cook like no other. The depth of the broth in all of the ramen dishes was just amazing: it was without question one of the finest meals a person could have. The presentation was beautiful, the noodles superb, the ingredients clearly fresh and cooked perfectly. I only wish they offered this more often, as it is great. Thanks, can't wait to come back."
5,"I'm not sure what the owner does to the boba but it's the best boba place I've ever been to in AZ. The boba tastes sweet and the drinks themselves are made very well. The owner doesn't just hire anyone and makes sure the quality of the drinks remain consistent. My favorite flavor is the chocolate banana smoothie with boba. A must try! Also, if you want to combine flavors, she (the owner) will definitely let you."
5,A favorite of mine. Probably the one restaurant that I've been to the most in the 10 years I've been here in Phoenix. Love the Mexican Short Stack.
5,I saw a skinny asian girl first...I was wondering is she ok? Maybe not strong enough.\nBut!\nThis skinny girl was amazing powerful and she knows perfect spot!!\nI def will visit again.\nMany foot massage places on Spring Mt. Most places are good foot massage but not so good for shoulder/back.\nThis Tibet place was awesome!
5,"Love this place!  The food is awesome.  Only complaint is that the \""roll of the day\"" rarely lives up to the expectations set by my first visit."
5,"Food is just too awesome. Highly recommend! Tortillas are handmade which makes it even more awesome so let's add more stars.shrimp Coctel is a plus and the tacos is just yum yum crazy. love the chile rellenos but not a fan for the red sauce but decided to try it and it's actually pretty good, kids loved the quesadilla, so if your looking for a new frequent place to eat this would be the spot."
5,"It's been almost 5 months since my original review, so I stopped back in here with Mike C. today to see if it's still great.  Last visit was on a Sunday, which of course is \""fancy\"" day at a buffet, so it would be interesting to see how it is for a weekday lunch.  Well, Yelpies, it's still great!\n\nSome of my favorite things they were serving today to a capacity crowd were baby bok choy cooked in a garlic fish sauce, amazing stuffed crabs on the half-shell, four choices of REAL ice cream, & so on.\n\nWoohoo!"
5,"Granted time is of the essence, but the Staff at RiRa handled our group of 19 on a thirsty Thursday evening with ease!  Don't let uptown parking scare you away from crashing this party, with the Discovery Place parking deck just blocks away RiRa is very accessible for those not living Uptown."
5,This is a cute little candy shop! I love how they keep their candy in glass jars it's a throw back on how things used to be. The workers will actually get the candy and bag it for you. That is a relief because I'm a bit clumsy! I bought some cotton candy here which they make fresh for you. I enjoyed seeing how they make it. The portion is huge it lasted us like 4 days. They can also add edible glitter .....I had them put extra glitter on mine.
5,"Just found my favorite spa in the valley! Had a scrub and facial with Ranee yesterday and it was heaven! I literally fell asleep for a little bit while the mask was on. This facial was the best I've ever had and I cannot recommend Ranee enough! Serious pampering and my skin feels awesome. The products they use at the spa are great- I usually prefer Aveda products but these were really nice. I did not leave feeling gooey at all. I can't wait to go back and thankfully their prices are reasonable, so I can return sooner rather than later!"
5,"Best Mac N Cheese in town!! Best steak, best ribs, best onion rings...I don't think I've ever tried something I didn't love! Very friendly staff. \""Take out\"" is fast and best of all the pint of mac n cheese is only like $4 including the Best corn bread in town!! Lol"
5,"Was a big hit at our wedding in Warren, NJ. The woman was professional, on-time and extremely helpful throughout the night. I would highly recommend this company if you're in the market for a photo booth rental."
5,"Doug, the owner, came out and installed a new pet door in our house and did an amazing job.  This was the second door we have had him install for us and we have been very happy with both installs.  We even had an outlet and a cable box that needed to be moved and he moved them to the opposite wall for a minimal charge.  I would definitely recommend Affordable Pet Doors."
5,"This is by far my favorite taco shop in the states, and that is probably because my all time favorite is the Tacos El Gordo in Tijuana. For some authentic & delicious tacos this place is a must, plus you can't beat the prices for the amount of food you get. I was in Vegas for 48hrs and literally managed to eat here on 3 separate occasions, and I plan for next trip to have a layover in Vegas just so I can stop thru and get my fix."
5,Came here on a whim after our attempt at mexican food failed. This place ended up pretty awesome. Pizza was great and different. Who would have thought eating pizza in squared slices other than the traditional wedges would have been so cool? \n\nThe dessert topped our evening with the baked cookies with ice cream on top - we came out a 5 pounds heavier with a smile on our faces!
5,"I got an ad under my hotel room door for this pizza delivery place.  What caught my eye was the Chicago Deep Dish pizza.  Now, I don't visit Chicago, so I have only seen mouth-watering pictures of the real thing.  I have tried numerous places that have advertised deep dish pizza, but I've always been disappointed, so I can't believe they represented the real thing (Pizza Hut, anyone?).  But this ad included a pretty impressive picture, so I decided to give it a try.  Well, I am extremely happy!  This is the best pizza I've had in years!  Lots of cheese, sauce, and toppings, and a crust that wasn't super-thick and bready, or fried.  My friend and I could not finish the 12-inch pie we ordered.    If you like your pizza piled high with toppings and a good flavorful sauce, give this place a try!  5 stars for the superb pizza!"
5,Food was great but not as great as out waiter Anthony ABad he really made our dinner awesome and gave us the best service We will be back and will make sure to sit in Anthony's section
5,"I'm \""late\"" as usual w/ my reviews BUT here's my 2cent.  \nI really liked this Walmart it wasn't crowded when I went in around 1pm on a Thursday. What impressed me was that they had the Lactose Free Yoplait (yay!) that I could never find - the Walmart, Target & Frys near me (85255) don't carry it. \nThe store was clean, organized & the staff was very nice. I will definitely take the drive 2 this location!"
5,Fantastic dinner at Pita Jungle!   Wish we had this place back east!  Fantastic app of Seared and Seasoned Tuna over Hummus.  A combo I wouldn't have thought of but flavor that knocks you off your feet!   Great Gyro too.  No street meat here!   Wife had Hummus and Beef tips and she loved it as well!   Young vibe and good bar scene.  Open late.  Quick sit down service.  We will be back very soon. Can't wait!
5,"Salon Sandoval gave me a great experience!\n  I was in need of a blow out for a special occasion and Chris did an amazing job.  I have gone to many salons in Phoenix for blow outs and  this was one of the very best.\n My appointment was on time and I was attended to in a friendly , clean environment by a lovely staff. Thank you Salon Sandoval I look forward to my next visit !"
5,"-First time visit was today\n-Super friendly service\n-They customized my friend's order, and were very pleasant about the special request\n- Great local and fresh ingredients\n- Vegetarian friendly, as well as have standard meaty items on menu\n-Outdoor dining area, great for beautiful spring day\n-Extremely casual - will be great for quick work lunch or to bring my toddler on weekend\n- Put twists on standard fare, e.g. instead of brocolli and cheddar soup, they had a fresh, lighter, housemade brocolli, cheddar and jalapeno soup (delicious!!)"
5,"My family and I love this place!!!  The food is so tasty!  I love soup in the winter and salad in the summer so I can come here year round.... My favorite soup is the potato cream cheese and the broccoli cheese and you just can't go wrong with the Mediterranean Salad.  Among my favorites of soups and salad I also have to say that I have all wonderful experiences with all the different foods I've tried there.  The BLT with Avocado and Cheese, The Ham Sandwich and the Raviolis!!!  Okay I'm hungry again."
5,"Best doctor ever! I used to go to Kimberly Adams but she fired me (for not having an expensive follow-up mammogram) and now I'm so glad she did as I found Dr. Harouni who is as good as her other reviews describe. She's very smart, patient, kind and unhurried. She referred to me to Dr. Schroeder, a great ENT and he took my tonsils out - something two other doctors had refused to refer me for - including Kimberly Adams."
