Carl's stuck in his ways, does the same old designs from the 80s. No fancy fondant or sugar work. Simple cakes for simple minds. Deb R. from Carl's Cakes commented, thanks for the pics. Can tell which ones Carl did, they're basic. Other decorators there do more creative work.""",True

""Terrible experience. $70 per head for dinner, soda extra, two bucks a pop, no free refills. Bathrooms busted, had to switch boats, no comp for the trouble. Sat two hours at port for a crappy buffet - red potatoes, pork, soggy salad, mediocre prime rib. Waited thirty minutes for a server who didn't even know he had our table. Once he showed up, he didn't do much serving. In fact, we never saw him again. Unforgettable, but not in a good way.""",True

Last night, only 14 couples ahead of me and still took over an hour to get a table. Don't think I'll be back until they shape up.""",True

Don't waste your cash here, go to New Seoul instead. Korean restaurants are either nice looking with subpar food and service, or they're a hole in the wall with better quality.

Sat, Mar 12. Hotel City Center Arias. Nice joint. Haze, too crowded. Taos, packed due to some bigshot DJ. Xs, three folks (two dudes, one broad) paid 20 bucks to skip the line. Otherwise, it's a 1.5-hour wait. Cover's 80, drinks cost 42. Waited an hour for three drinks. That's pretty dumb.

Bar outside (not by the pool, under the cabana) had a bartender who was visibly irritated. Started griping about having only two hands and one job. Got loud with the customers, telling them to hush up. Someone asked what her issue was, so she called security and had the guy tossed. Classy.

XS is alright if you spring for bottle service. Been there twice before, had a blast both times. Maybe that's why the bartender's still working there - they want you to shell out for the good stuff. Wouldn't go back otherwise.

It's like they took a sweet stir fry and just threw some chicken in there. The rice is hard as a rock and the salad's drowning in dressing. My wife likes her dressing, but this is just ridiculous. \n\nThe service is also pretty lacking. Our waitress seemed clueless about the menu and even tried to tell us they didn't have chicken udon, even though it's right there on the menu. She finally admitted she was wrong, but it just seemed like they weren't paying attention. Our food came out at all different times and it just felt disorganized. \n\nAll in all, it was a pretty disappointing experience. I think they're too focused on making AYCE work and they're neglecting everything else. Maybe they should rethink that strategy.""",True

And forget about free water - we had to ask for it. The carne asada looked decent, but it was piled high on a bed of red cabbage. Gross. My boyfriend got ripped off on the guac and sour cream, too.

One bench for all us guys to sit on, like we're some kinda rowboat crew. Can't bring our own equipment, no jump ropes or resistance bands. No classes or education either. \nAt first, it seemed like a good deal, low monthlies and no contracts. But they still charge annual fees and cancellation fees, same as the other gyms.

I visited the shelter today, hoping to find a new feline friend. After checking out the cats, I decided to take a gander at the dogs. Can't hurt, right? Maybe I'd even find a new furry companion to take home.

I wandered around for a good half hour, but no one seemed interested in helping me. People passed by, giving me strange looks, like I was an alien or something. The workers were just standing around, gossiping under a tent, not lifting a finger to help.

Finally, I approached them, seeking assistance. They stared at me, unenthused, before one of them reluctantly helped me look at a dog. He mumbled a few words and then scurried back to his gossip fest.

I returned the dog, and once again, everyone gave me the cold shoulder. It seemed like they were more interested in chatting than helping potential adopters. The dogs were crying out for attention, their cages marked ""I need walked,"" but only the volunteers were taking them for strolls. What a shame.

I felt pretty crummy leaving the shelter. It's a real pity, since the folks there were generally nice, except for the dog adoption crew. Their lack of friendliness and laziness was a major turnoff. I won't be going back, which is unfortunate. With a bit of effort, they could find homes for many more dogs.",True

Second time, shrimp tempura roll, chicken yakisoba. Place was empty, late for dinner. Shrimp tempura rubbery, yakisoba noodles overcooked, bad tasting chicken, gloppy sauce from a jar. Asked server, he said that's how they make it. Soy sauce, their own recipe, tasted rancid. Spoke to manager, he acted like we should be honored to eat there, doing us a favor in Chandler.

Friday night, celebratin' birthday with the missus. No parkin' at the entrance, so we had to park elsewhere and walk back. Check-in staff was just okay. Got our room info, walked back to the car, drove over, and got our bags out. Walked up to the room, opened the door, and oh boy, it was a double bed room, not the king we reserved. Called the front desk, got the ""fully booked"" excuse, and they put me on hold. Told us to come back to the front, so we loaded up the car and drove back. Stood in line, went through the whole thing again, and got a new room assigned. Walked back to the car, drove over to the other side of the property, unloaded the bags, and walked to the new room. Opened the door, and it was like steppin' back into 1981. Interior design, that is. Gave up, dropped off the bags, and walked over to the restaurant. Couldn't even figure out where the door was, so we walked back to the car and drove over to the Elephant Bar instead. Had some good grub and drinks, went back to the room, and slept like babies. Checked out the next mornin', went home, and saw the $175 hotel bill. Made me wonder what I paid for.",True

Mike P and Ashley D are back for another Sunday brunch review. This time, they went to the Original Sunrise Cafe, as their restaurant.com certificate couldn't be used at Hash House on Sundays. They were both starving, so they embarked on this adventure.

The cafe was packed, but they were seated quickly. It had a nice vibe and was filled with people. The fresh coffee was average, like most Vegas cafe coffee. They looked over the menu and noticed that while it covered several breakfast categories, there was only a small selection for each.

Both Mike and Ashley decided on omelets. The cafe offers egg-white versions of every omelet, which Mike thought was a good idea. His omelet, the Eggzilla, was pretty good, with egg whites, spinach, roasted peppers, salsa, sunrise garlic sauce, and jack cheese. However, Ashley's omelet was nothing special.

For $8.99, the omelets come with a bagel or toast on the side, making it a decent deal. But, considering all the other breakfast and brunch spots available, you can do a little better.",True

The Cajun Chicken sandwich was a chicken breast with a sprinkle of paprika. Tasted like cardboard, the roll was hard. Served dry, with tomato and lettuce if you wanted. The curly fries were decent, considering the sandwich. Took forever to pay the bill. The staff kept walking around, complaining about being short-staffed and how their last table didn't leave enough tip. I get it, it's frustrating, but in front of other patrons? A bit...off.""",True

The massage and facial were unremarkable...\nIf asked during a massage if there's an area you'd like to focus on, don't say a specific area. I've done it before without issue, but this therapist took it as a cue to rush through the rest of the body. She gave me a quick neck and shoulder massage and then abruptly ended it. No gentle transition, just sudden completion. \nThe facial was similar. The therapist was young, energetic, and chatty. She worked quickly, using short, rapid strokes instead of slower, deeper ones that would have made it more relaxing. It felt like she was trying to jolt me awake instead of promoting serenity. \nAs a first-time customer, I received a discounted rate, but I wouldn't pay full price for a massage here. These people are novices. If you want to avoid these two women, message me, and I'll share their names with you.""",True

""Lee's Vietnamese sandwiches didn't impress. Maybe it's 'cause the last time I had one, it was done right. When I walked in, I thought it was an American sub shop. They had a small section of Vietnamese products, but it didn't feel authentic. \n\nI got the grilled pork sandwich, thit nuong. Same as the one I had before, but that one was in Sacramento. This one missed the mark. The pork lacked flavor, the portion was small, and the sauce wasn't my cup of tea. The bread was good, though. Crispy outside, soft inside. \n\nMy dad got the combo sandwich. Don't know what kind of meat was in it, but he didn't like it either. If you're lookin' for a real Vietnamese sandwich, keep lookin'. I was disappointed.""",True

We hit up Surrender for MDW, eager to catch Calvin Harris. Prepaid tix got us in quick, even though we rolled up at 11:30pm. But once inside, the vibe fizzled fast.

The outdoor setup was cool, but the execution sucked. Calvin was spinning at the indoor part of the club, but nobody could hit the dance floor unless they shelled out $3000 for a table. What's the point of letting people in if they can't even dance? A waste of cash on the cover, and it wasn't cheap either - $100 for dudes and $40 for ladies.

It's hot, but it tastes like straight out of a can. Gross. My girl's meal wasn't much better. She got some Green Chile Chicken thing, and it looked like a mess.

I ordered my burrito, and they gave me a number and told me to take a seat. While I waited, I noticed other customers looking just as confused as I was about the poor service. When my burrito finally arrived, I was famished. But let me tell you, it was tiny. I'm not one to complain about small portions, but this thing was laughable. It came with a lime wedge that was dried out and looked like it had been sitting there for a day. The carne asada was flavorless and had a weird texture.

Can't do that when you're packed in like sardines. Don't care how good you look comin' in, you'll look nasty if you're sweaty and wasted. Might be a strategic move to push your way into the crowd, though, 'cause it's hard to fall down with all those people holdin' you up. Those girls in the pools are real depressin', too.

Why would they let people punch a bag during a music set? Outside, there was a big patio. Inside, a bigger room with a stage and punching machine, and a smaller room for darts and pool.

You've had one sake too many, can't be arsed with a 90-minute bus ride home? Stumble into the nearest hotel, that's what. In our case, it was the Thistle King James Hotel. Twin rooms were all they had left, so we took 'em.

Passed out on what I'd call glorious mattresses, perfect for me, but the boy wasn't a fan. It was bloody hot, and we couldn't find the thermostat. Not a huge deal for me, but the fact that I felt like I was sleeping next to the pissed bloke outside instead of being separated by concrete and six floors got under my skin a bit.

After a concert at Stage AE, my boyfriend and I were looking for a spot to relax our weary feet. We strolled across the street to The Pittsburgh Grille. The joint had a swell decor, with some snazzy sports murals adorning the walls. They had a bunch of flat-screen TVs scattered around the bar and dining area, but it didn't feel too overwhelming since it was right next to the stadium. I was impressed by the cigar bar - it added a touch of class to the place. The atmosphere was plush and comfy.

We only stayed for one drink, though I would've liked to have a few more. Some gal in the bar was hollering obscenities at a hockey game that wasn't even on.

The bartender was too busy flirting to notice our empty glasses, even though there were only a handful of folks in the room.

""Hoped to find a solid BBQ joint. Heard good things, but waited 'til the hype died down. Turns out, it's a bust. Shared a brisket and turkey sandwich with mom, plus some sides.

My buddy got a burger that looked decent and a poutine, which was probably the best dish we ordered. The sauce was damn good, and the cheese curds were fresh, big, and made that nice squeak sound before they started to melt. For the poutine, it was worth it. For the rest, I felt like ""meh.""

Dan Marino's, in the Hooters Hotel and Casino, served us breakfast till noon.

For ten bucks, we feasted on the basics - scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, diced potatoes, dry cereal, and waffles with strawberries. The waffles were more like thick pancakes, but still decent.

Breakfast's got waffles, french toast, omelets, breakfast meats 'n' potatoes. Lunch 'n' dinner's the same: fried seafood, pizza, Chinese food (which is pretty tasty), some nights got crab legs 'n' steaks for a bit more. Wait staff's generally nice 'n' attentive. Price can't be beat: 6-9-12 bucks for breakfast, lunch, 'n' dinner, respectively, with a player's card. Can't find a better deal elsewhere. In review: it's cheap, it's basic.""",True

""Good grub, real meat, fresh salads. But the ladies need a lesson in customer service. They're from the Middle East, I reckon. Not used to interacting with men in public. But this is the West, and we do things differently here. If they can't handle serving men, they shouldn't be working behind a counter. It's simple. I've been to Basha twice. First time, the woman looked like she hated her job. Second time, the bald guy was friendly, but his wife gave me the stink-eye when I asked for my change. If she doesn't want to serve men, she should stick to cooking in the back.""",True

I went for the soup dumplings and fried string beans. Twenty bucks for two dishes, not too shabby.

The verdict? The dumplings were just okay, a bit overcooked. The green beans were tasty, but man, they were swimming in grease.

I might give this place another shot. Didn't exactly love what I had, but it wasn't all bad.""",True

Stopped by on a Thursday night, they call it ""Carpe Noctem"", Goth night, that is. Kids in the parking lot, dressed up spooky and all, hearse parked outside. Figured we were in the right place.

Dance floor was decent, full of people, but the bar area, empty. Bartender, quick and friendly, pours a good drink. Got myself a nice buzz going, decided to hit the dance floor. Problem was, not enough space, weird metal plates, felt like I was gonna slip 'n fall.

Can't judge a Goth club on one visit, that's the truth. It's a scene, a lifestyle, takes time to fit in. Remembered how long it took me to feel welcome at my own club back home. So, won't make any hasty judgments here.

Goth scene, dying off, slowly (ahh, pun intended). Take what you can get in Vegas, that's the way it is.""",True

My omelette was alright, but I didn't get any hash browns, just a couple slices of small toast. A real classy joint would've thrown in some fresh fruit to fill out the platter, but not Drew's.

Dessert is my favorite part of the meal, always. Was a bit bummed they didn't have crab or lobster, but for $20, what do you expect? Sushi was just California rolls, something I can whip up at home.

Saturday morning, I hit the brunch spot at 11am. Line wasn't too bad. Noticed they got them self-pay kiosks now. Good call when the line's long.

Omelette station's where it's at. Got two eggs over easy. Way better than them powdered eggs for scrambled. Other breakfast joint had potatoes and Portuguese sausage.

Found the salmon lox, capers, onion, and made a killer croissant sandwich. No bagels though. Finished off with some fresh fruit and Greek yogurt.

You can grab a seat at the bar, sink into a comfy chair, or park yourself at a table and catch the game. My only gripe's the atmosphere - not the vibe, but the smoke.

You're shelling out double for a sandwich that doesn't hold a candle to Lee's Sandwich in L.A., but I'm familiarizing myself with Vegas and this joint is the only spot I know for a decent Vietnamese sandwich. Everything on the menu is pricey. Curiosity got the better of me, so I brought my husband back to sample the rest of the grub.

Served my salad in a styrofoam box with plastic utensils, the tiny dressing container was a red flag - they wanted top dollar for a second helping. It was a good salad, chicken on top had some gristle, bacon was decent. Hubby got Stromboli, nothing special but good. He got real silverware and a pizza sheet. Kid got a cheese pizza.

Lunch at Monty's Blue Plate Diner. Service was top-notch, attentive and friendly. Artichoke sandwich was a letdown, too much bread, not enough flavor. Coleslaw side was decent though.

Rio casino was chill, not too crowded on a weekday. Variety of games, but I didn't spend much time there. Strip's where it's at for gamblin'. Free shuttle to other casinos was sweet. Room was comfy, but outdated tech, ya know? Old CRT TV and no wifi. Ethernet cable did the trick, though. Conference area had wireless, so that was cool.

I came here for a buddy's 21st birthday bash. Been here a few times before, and it's a crap shoot. Depends on my mood, I reckon.

Pros: Great spot for people watchin', got a mix of characters and beautiful people. Prices ain't too bad, never paid a cover charge. Fun, upbeat atmosphere, perfect for youngins.

Cons: Can be a bit douchey, people starin' you down like you're a piece of meat. Music's loud, but not much dance space, folks bunch up by the front, feels kinda weird. Drinks take forever, too.

Overall, it's alright for a birthday bash, but not my go-to joint. Don't hate it, don't love it neither.",True

But it was summer, we were a group of 50, so I figured why not? We took over the back, which was nice. Drinks were well-made, assume they were cheap. Two pool tables in the back, a bit awkward near the bar. Music was generic, classic drunk girl anthems to Top 40 hits. Hubby liked the bathroom attendant, said he must be related to Lil Jon, yelling stuff like ""Get yo piss on!"" No pictures policy, which was pretty lame.

I walked into the joint around 8:40 on a Monday night. Place was already hopping with three parties deep. I hit the head before settling in, and let me tell you, there was a cockroach the size of a small dog staring back at me while I was taking care of business. Not exactly what I had in mind.

My buddy and I went for the AYCE dinner, $22.95 a pop. Appetizer was some questionable stuff called ""THE SHIT!"" - didn't do much for me, but my friend seemed to enjoy it. We also scored the 2-for-1 Sapporo deal, which was a damn good thing. Two huge bottles, enough to fill four cups. Not bad.

Sashimi salad was decent, loaded with sashimi. Just how I like it. Don't need no rice filling me up at an AYCE joint. I also went for salmon, yellowtail, and albacore sashimi. Fresh, but not the best fish I've ever had. Thin slices, too. Sashimi roll was solid, packed with raw fish and wrapped in cucumber. No rice in sight.

My friend ordered a spicy crab roll, monster roll, baked lobster roll, and baked scallop roll. All good eats.

Almost went to the grocery store to buy eggs to toss at 'em. Not exactly classy, but damn, they were annoying. \n\nOverall, not a terrible experience. Just be aware of their chapel hours.

""Tired of the bright lights and loud sounds of the city? Come on down to Treasure Island Hotel and experience a little bit of country charm. Our venue is open late, so even if you've been kicked out of everywhere else, you're always welcome here. We play classic country tunes, perfect for two-stepping and line dancing. And if you're feeling brave, take a spin on our mechanical bull. Just be sure to keep an eye out for our resident hot blonde cowgirl – she'll show you how it's done. Our dance floor is spacious, and the atmosphere is always lively.

Hungry? Sorry, our kitchen had closed by the time you arrived. But don't worry, our friendly bartenders will keep your glass full and your spirits high. Our clientele tends to be a bit older, but that doesn't mean they can't still kick up their heels and have a good time. So saddle up and join us for a night of country fun.""",True

Not bad. Creamy horseradish sauce, mixed greens, few beans. Well-smoked fish, y'know? \n\nVegan sweet potato soup. Nice touch. Flash your IKEA family card, get some freebies. A meal, yeah?

""Underwhelming experience with too much repetition.""

The original text describes a negative dining experience at a Chinese restaurant. The food was of poor quality, and while the service and ambiance were acceptable, they did not make up for the subpar cuisine. The writer expresses their disappointment and lack of enthusiasm for returning to the establishment.

In the revised version, the language is more concise and direct, reflecting Hemingway's distinctive writing style. Instead of stating that the food was ""kind of low-end Chinese,"" the revised text simply describes it as ""low-end Chinese."" Additionally, the phrase ""not really bad, just not good either"" is condensed into ""underwhelming experience with too much repetition."" Overall, the revised text maintains the same meaning as the original while incorporating Hemingway's signature concision and clarity.",True

This is old Vegas, where everything is dirt cheap - drinks, food, you name it. But, let me tell you, it's pretty damn ghetto here, especially at night. Saw a lot of street people, and some suspicious-looking bags. But hey, that's part of the charm, right? You can just walk around with an open container, no worries.

Onion roll would've been better. \n\nHusband went with the BYOB. Beef patty, pepper jack cheese, jalapenos, and caramelized onions on an onion roll. Well done. Flavorful and juicy. \n\nService was a bit slow, but they'd only been open a week. Cut 'em some slack. Hopefully, they'll get it together soon.""",True

Steve's Greenhouse Grill? A-OK, I reckon. Like Cracker Barrel, but without the corporate backing and with a dash of sporty flair. Loud colors, loud TVs, and booze ads plastered everywhere. Menu's a mixed bag - something for everyone, but nothing too fancy. Drinks? Overpriced, but what do you expect? Servers? Friendly, but a bit too eager to please. Had the chicken fried steak with fries, Kristen had the fish and chips with clam chowder. Food was decent, but not perfect. Some dishes were too salty, others just right, a few too bland. If Cracker Barrel trimmed the fat and tried to cater to every type of customer in Phoenix, they'd end up with Steve's Greenhouse Grill.",True

Wonder how it'll be when they close 'em. \n\nFood? Delicious. Service? Good. But, two visits, we saw bartenders prepping garnishes with bare hands. Juice running down their arms, slicing oranges for drinks. Another time, a bartender reached into the olive jar, grabbed a handful, and put 'em in the garnish tray. I promptly removed the olives from my martini. \n\nCentral Bistro, get your act together before Maricopa County pays a visit.""",True

Now, they got a random guest elevator that takes you to a random floor, then you gotta navigate through some pool-side concert and up another flight to get to the good stuff. Not too shabby. \n\nStill ain't a fan of the tiny dance floor they got, and how it's always closed off. And when it gets crowded, forget about it. You gotta go outside if you wanna breathe, but that's not exactly ideal in the winter. \n\nIt's clear that the same folks who designed TAO did this place too. No flow, no ambiance, no way to party comfortably. Guess I'll stick with XS.""",True

Second time around, the staff were eager to give me the full DavidsTea experience. You can buy tea for home or to-go, and they've got different labels for each. Pricy, but I figured I needed a pick-me-up. So, hot or iced? Latté, black, or with milk? Honey or agave? I went with a chocolate-orange blend, whisked soy milk, and agave...for 4,50$! Everything's optional, but watch out, 'cause the tea-maker'll toss whatever doesn't fit your cup down the drain! Was it good? Hell yeah, it was epic! But also pretty damn pricey, if you ask me.

Can't go wrong there. Location's top-notch too, right across from the mall and some restaurants, easy on and off the interstate. Room's big, like a little studio, with a full fridge, stove, microwave, and it's clean as a whistle. But, couple things that ain't so hot. First, the room feels stuffy when you walk in, like someone's been cooking up a storm. Kick up the AC, but then it's too cold. Can't seem to find that sweet spot. Second, pillows are flat, like sleeping on a pancake. Two pillows don't help much neither. Third, stairs are steep, no elevator in sight.

Aw, poor Kamakura, why all the hate?

I got a soft spot for this place, 'cause it's been a family fave for years. My old man took us there when they first opened, 'cause he just discovered sushi. And we kept goin' back, mostly for special occasions, 'cause it was pricey, y'know?

I still stop in most every time I visit, usually for the Teppan. Don't know if the chefs/waiters are as into it as they used to be, or if it's just my perspective that's changed. Either way, it's not as ""special"" as it was back in the day.

Visited 5/8/12...

Found this joint while searching for a unique lunch spot. Seemed new.
Located in the same building as a gas station, corner of Southern and Higley.

Ordered Gyro and Fries, took it to go. Only one other customer at 12:15 p.m.
Food was good, but not the best I've had. Disappointing portion size - three meat slices, two tomato slices.
Satisfying for a quick lunch, though.

Glanced at the menu and saw some intriguing options. Might try them later.
A decent alternative to fast food. Not worth going out of my way for now, but I'd return for a Gyro if I'm in the area.

Will check back in a month or so to see if they're still open. Tough location and limited visibility from the street.",True

Used coat-check, but they charged $5 (better pay than losin' it). Went straight to the bar, presented my free-drink coupon, bartender told me my options, I picked one. It was an okay drink. Enjoyed it while watchin' the gogo dancers and other girls dancin' and partyin'. GoGo dancers were okay, beautiful, but they barely showed some good moves. Friendly, though, and people were gettin' pics with 'em. Girls in the club were beautiful. Didn't get a chance to dance, but enjoyed the music - mix dance music, speakers were just loud enough. Dance floor looked decent-sized. They got a VIP area for private parties, too. Might repeat.""",True

First off, there's no clear indication that it's a seat-yourself kinda place. I stood there like a dope, wondering why there were no menus on the tables. Finally, I grabbed a table and waited for the server. Ordered the bruschetta and pesto burger, which was decent, but tiny for the price. Fresh cut fries were extra, and after adding that to the bill, we're talking ten bucks for a burger and some fries. Not worth it.

""This joint's one of the few in Vegas that doesn't try to screw you over. Best time to hit it up's lunchtime. They got great deals for $5.99. I went for grilled chicken with mashed taters and veggies, my buddy got the mushroom penne pasta. My chicken was better than her dish, even though it was a bit dry. But hey, dip it in them taters and suddenly it's alright. \n\nThing that sucks is some lady comes by and asks if you wanna take a pic for a souvenir card. Sounds nice, but she's just trying to sell you your own damn picture. Politely decline, that's my advice. Don't know why they do that. \n\nOh, and the seats outside the john are uncomfortable as hell. Plastic chairs, man. Restaurant seats are way comfier, so sit inside.""",True

It was alright, but nothing special. \n\nI give it two stars for the grub and an extra for squeezing us in on a busy Friday night.

The metal door slams shut with a satisfying thud, adding to the charm of the place. Dinner's not an option, they close at 4, so you better be ready for some serious lunch vibes. I followed Robert M.'s orders and went for the green chile burrito, enchilada style, with a side of beans. The beans were a little runny, but perfect for dipping my burrito bits.

Beer cheese is usually orange and creamy, not white and watery. Cost $7, too. Daughter thought it was terrible. I tried it and agreed - no flavor, not even a hint of garlic. Disappointing. Waitress didn't seem convinced or willing to replace it. Should've insisted on a new bowl or comped it. Felt bad since my daughter skipped a meal for the subpar appetizer. Glad to see Goldie's expand their offerings beyond burgers, wings, and pizzas. Will return to try a sandwich.""",True

I came here for a full-body rubdown. It was alright. But the place could use some improvements. One big room, and all the noise from other folks gets distracting. Wish they had some privacy screens or somethin'. Didn't feel too relaxed, but I guess that's what you get for the price.

The gal who worked me over was nice enough. Started out gentle, but man, she really dug into my shoulders. They're still sore the next day.

And then there's this weird thing at the end. You gotta pay up front, and your masseuse just stands there, waiting for a tip. Feels like they won't let you leave 'til you cough up.

Not exactly what you'd expect from a night out at a winery. And the bruschetta? Forgettable. Regular toast, small portions, and zero flavor. But hey, the mushroom risotto, twisted burger, and mac and cheese? Spot on. Risotto was veggie, though, so add some protein if you're hungry. Service was top-notch, too.

Consumers will always find a way to get what they want, even if it means shopping online and paying $5 shipping from the US. Sephora had a good selection of brands, not all girly, but staff were pushy about the $150 creams. I'd recommend researching brands beforehand, some were just there because of compliant packaging. Prices were similar to elsewhere, but some products had a premium attached due to limited availability. Sucks that Canadian Sephora orders over $150 have free shipping, while US orders over $50 do.

And if you're feeling extra fancy, grab a few of those homemade doughnuts. Thirteen sugary bites, three dipping sauces. Raspberry, chocolate, vanilla cream. You know you want 'em. \n\nPricey? Maybe.

Cantina rocks. Don't let the exterior fool you. Inside, it's bustling with energy and flavor. Weekends are packed, mostly with younger crowds, but it's not your typical frat spot. Make a reservation and brace yourself for a wait, but it's worth it.

Their margaritas are top-notch, and the Kiwi/Strawberry Special is a must-try. They've got great Mexican beers on tap too. Drink up, everyone else is.

Now, the food. Where do I start? The chopped tostada salad is divine if you're looking for something light. Craving something heartier? The refried beans and pulled chicken won't disappoint. But my favorite? The Kobe beef fajitas. Order this. Trust me.

""I've had my fair share of meals at this joint, and let me tell you, it's top-notch. Family-owned, through and through. You can taste it in the food, the way they take pride in their recipes. It's a mix of Italian and American cuisine, but don't let that fool you. Their prime rib, pork, seafood, and caesar salad are all top-shelf. I stick to the Italian dishes, can't help myself. That linguine with king crab and crispy leeks in lemon butter sauce? Divine. My husband's a fan of the old-school spaghetti and Kobe meatballs. Service is impeccable, and the decor? Spectacular. Wine list is endless, cocktails galore. This place oozes sex appeal.""",True

Monday night, took the kids out for an early dinner. They were hungry, and the joint offered free grub for the little ones on Mondays. Hostesses looked like they were just hangin' out, but the reviews said the service was gonna be rough. Turns out, we got sat down quick and the waitress was on top of things. She wasn't all up in our business every ten seconds, but she made sure we had everything we needed. Some dude in plain clothes came by, asked if everything was cool. We said yeah, and a few minutes later, he snuck up behind me and grabbed my empty cup. Asked if my waitress was gettin' me another beer. Told him no, and that was that. Guy must've been a manager, but he coulda introduced himself. Good chow, good service. Oh, and happy hour's from 11 to 7, Monday through Friday.",True

Instead, it was a massive hunk of foie and a piece of butterfish, all on a bed of shredded Brussels sprouts, topped with black truffle sauce. Decadent doesn't even begin to describe it. Also tried some other dishes - creamed spinach, gnocchi, lobster au curry - and let me tell you, that creamed spinach was something else.

Hard to stop munching. \n\nBananas Foster butter cakes - a tad too sweet for my liking, but others enjoyed them. Butter pecan ice cream - divine! \n\nGodiva chocolate cake with vanilla bean ice cream - oh my goodness! Licking the plate would've been acceptable (in some circles). \n\nWhitehaven Sauvignon Blanc - lovely, light, fresh bouquet.

Sunday at Spring Valley Park with Solin, a foundling Poodle. We searched online for dog parks and this one had top reviews. Three fenced areas for different breeds.

We ordered grilled artichoke and cornbread sides - the artichoke was great, the cornbread was the best I've had. For my main course, I went with the steak and enchilada. The 6oz filet was sliced into three pieces and had a spicy maroon sauce on the side. The enchilada had their signature rotisserie chicken inside. Both were tasty.

The wife had the Macho Salad. It arrived without the rotisserie chicken, but they fixed that quick. She enjoyed it.

Don't usually do desserts, but they got my attention. \n\nNow, they know us by name when we walk in. Feels good, man. Daily specials are a no-brainer. Don't even need the menu no more. Just go with the special, never been disappointed. \n\nGot a tip for ya: follow 'em on FB, get a $2 sando if you're quick on the updates. \n\nThis place is worth checkin' out.

Las Vegas, a place known for its vices, now boasts a virtue - its sandwiches. At Planet Hollywood, I savored ""The Full Montagu"" at Earl of Sandwich. A hot roast beef delight, it came with turkey, Swiss and cheddar cheese, lettuce, and their signature mustard sauce. I skipped the tomatoes, as they can overwhelm the flavors. The bread, though, was the real star - sturdy yet soft, it held everything together perfectly. If you're in Vegas and want something different from the usual buffet, give Earl of Sandwich a try.",True

Didn't ask for a size, so I figured it'd be a regular. But no, they gave me a large cup. Damn good drink, worth every penny. Had a nutella latte before, and that was top-notch too. They got all sorts of pastries and desserts, including macaroons. Great place to grab a cup and chill or meet up with pals. Tons of parking outside.""",True

I scored a sweet pad within walking distance to everything that matters, including the best ski and ride shop in the desert. Ski Pro's got a killer selection, better than the joints in Colorado. They're all about movin' product, too - snagged a sick ski suit for my kiddo, marked down from $175 to $59. It's still peak season, y'all! They've got a solid selection of skis and boards, but that's a rare purchase for me. Let's just say they've got everything I need for my winter fun. Oh, and they're practically in the Biltmore's backyard.

The help's about average, you know? Not super attentive, but not rude either. They're just chillin', doing their thing. Most likely from middle-class families who can afford to hit the slopes. Can't expect them to be over-the-top friendly, that's just not the vibe here. At least they ain't stoned, paranoid, or semi-hostile like those Colorado ski bums.

I couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of it all as I checked out. Don't let those reviews fool you. It may not be the fanciest place, but it's got a nice Asian stank going on. Sure, there are downsides - cash and check only, cramped space, and a bit of dust.

Pork was a bit dry, but the steak was solid. Got the mashed potatoes instead of fries, but wished I'd gone for the fries. They were homemade, flavorful, and delish.

Had the cabbage rolls, herring, and veggie plate. Cabbage rolls weren't my thing, but others loved 'em. Herring was fresh and not too oily, glad I took the server's rec. Veggie plate was a work of art, everything fresh. Desserts were great too.

Staff tried to sell me copies of their pics, but my camera did the trick. Cameron Diaz's figure was a letdown - made her look better than she does in real life.

Gives the locals a chance to make a name for themselves. \n\nDidn't buy any booze yesterday, pre-gamed elsewhere, but grabbed an energy drink. Two, actually, since there's a $10 limit on cards and the drinks are four bucks a pop. Couple of bartenders keeping things moving. \n\nSound's good, but what I really like is how close you can get to the performers. Feels intimate, even with plenty of space.

St. Francis is a go-to for brunch (killer live tunes start at 10:30am Sundays) and dinner. Service is top-notch and grub is always on point. Get the breakfast sandwich, ditch the mayo-sauce (seriously, who needs that on a breakfast sandwich?). Flatbread pizzas and burgers are solid choices for dinner. And don't sleep on happy hour. Bar scene's cozy, but snag an outdoor seat and you're set.",True

This gambling den, as expected, draws in the elderly crowd. Slots and video poker galore, and a bingo hall that'll make your head spin. Met my folks there on a Wednesday, and I was one of a handful of youngbloods in the 21-30 age group. Dealers, though, were mostly spry young things. Nice perk: the senior crowd brings the blackjack minimum down to a measly $2. Good place to hone your 21 skills without breaking the bank. Settled in at a $5 table and walked away with some extra cash. Didn't spot a craps table, and the roulette wheel was automated (kind of strange).

Not usually a fan of cornbread, but slappin' some butter on that stuff made it pretty damn amazin'.\n\nOur server recommended the ribs, so I went ahead and got 'em with the yardbird, mac and cheese, and greens. All around, great eatin'. Ribs were fallin' off the bone, yardbird was real good too. Mac and cheese? Stellar. Greens? Some of the best I've had in North Carolina.\n\nFinished off the meal with the peach cobbler. It was alright, but not the best. Kind of wishin' they had more chocolate options. Still, I'd definitely come back to Mert's again.""",True

Crisp veggies, soft bun, and salty fries pleased. Ketchup complemented them nicely. Dill pickle, a delightful surprise. Fruit punch, however, lacked oomph. Watered down, it seemed. Recommendation: drinks without ice, add when ready.

If you're feeling lucky, hit up the bowling alley or catch a flick at the 18-screen theater. And let's be real, who doesn't love sneaking into an extra feature every now and then? I sure as hell do.

I've stayed at the Orleans for their slot tournament a couple times now. Three nights, tournament entry, all for a cool $99. Haven't won squat yet, but hey, there's always next time. The only downside to this place is its location off the strip. But hey, the Seamless Gentlemen's Club is just across the street. So, it's not like you're missing out on much.

Perfectly cooked, crisp outside, fluffy inside. Just what you want in a damn good doughnut. If you're looking for something different, give Chez Boris a shot. You won't regret it. And they use an SNES as a card holder? That's just icing on the cake. Cheers!""",True

I killed time at the old Pewter Rose spot, now gone, while waiting for someone at the airport. The place was jumpin', but they sat us at the kitchen counter, like a chef's table, and we watched them whip up the grub. The nutty fried chicken, recommended by the server, was a real treat, served with sweet potato mash and asparagus. The fluffy rolls, approved by a chef before being served, were outta this world. All in all, a great experience at a revamped old haunt. I'll be back to try more from the menu, which I didn't have time to fully check out, but it looked promising.",True

Lunch with the husband today. Veggie spring rolls, sweet chili, plum sauce - tasty. Interesting joint, bit dark. Nice waitress, quick service. Chicken phad thai, mild spice, extra peanuts.

Would return, but confident in finding better.",True

Also tried carrot, red velvet, and wheat pancakes. Ranked from best to worst: cinnamun, carrot, red velvet, wheat. \n\nCinnamun pancakes were flavorful, not too sweet. Recommend. Carrot pancake was good but couldn't taste the carrot. Like wheat but sweeter. Red velvet was dry, sugar overpowered it. \n\nCowboy omelette was alright. Eggs were overcooked, veggies overcooked. Prefer watery eggs, less cooked veggies. Fried potatoes were fine. Not too salty, not burnt. \n\nGive this place 3.5 stars. Good for breakfast, come back again. Excellent portion sizes.

The Arcadia Salad was solid too. The green chile Mac n Cheese was a bit of a letdown, being from New Mexico and all. The ribs were just okay, not falling off the bone like I'd hoped. \n\nI dig the vibe here - open, airy, and plenty of interesting artwork. But the music? Not feeling it.

Yesterday, a coworker and I visited the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop around 4:30 pm. Luckily, there was no line to get in and it wasn't busy, so we could take our time and chat with the workers. We learned a lot about how the show is filmed and it was a shame we arrived so late, we could have been extras since they were filming that day. I was told the guys work there Monday to Friday from 9 am to 3 pm, but mostly stay in the back to avoid the crowds. If you want to be on TV, bring something worth showing and be charming, or get there early to be an extra if you're lucky. They had some touristy stuff, but I didn't care, I got a Pawn Stars t-shirt and I'm proud of it. They didn't have a big store, but I enjoyed the memorabilia and heard some stories about how they got them, just like watching the show at home.

St. Francis, a swell spot for brunch in Phoenix. Classy joint with a pinch of trendiness. American grub with a mix of flavors. Nice selection of brews, and mimosas and Bloody Marys with brunch. Kids under 10 eat free, too.

Friendly staff, always. No slow service here. Food takes a bit, but that's not the server's fault. They're on top of your drink, asking when it's running low.

Eggs benedict with salmon, my go-to. Hollandaise sauce, tangy and buttery perfection. Used to come with fingerling potatoes, now just a few on the plate. Pork chile verde, spicy and seasoned just right. Served with corn bread for the stew. Cioppino, a spicy seafood stew, big enough to share. Great for happy hour, too, with apps and drinks by the fire on the patio. A real treat.",True

Vdara, a tranquil escape from the Strip's chaos. Spacious rooms, excellent service, and pleasant amenities. I've stayed here twice, enjoying the peaceful atmosphere each time. The rooms are generously sized, accommodating three people comfortably. Non-smoking throughout, and no casino noise, creating a serene environment. Located at the southern end of the Strip, slightly removed from the bustle, yet still accessible to Bellagio. While I prefer a livelier Vegas experience, Vdara's calm vibe appeals to those seeking relaxation. The pool, too, exudes tranquility. I'll gladly return to Vdara, especially since it's a great value on Hotwire. Look for a five-star, non-casino hotel on the south Strip, and chances are it'll be Vdara.

So I ordered it, and if I was still hungry, I'd get something else. Kitchen was fast, she said. Pretzel was great - soft, crunchy, and hot.

That's my only gripe. \n\nThe grub and service were top-notch after that. The best part about this joint is that they're cool with you splitting an entree.

""Tonto's the spot for a damn good time. Two prickly pear margaritas, Three Sisters Salsa, and a side of guac'll do the trick. Dessert's always changing, but it's never a letdown. We're usually the youngins' in the joint, but we don't mind. Fridays and weeknights are our jam. \n\nI go for the burger and sweet potato tots when I'm feelin' hungry. Margaritas are top-shelf, not watered down like some other places. Two's my limit, but they'll make me a happy man. \n\nBirthdays are special at Tonto's. Tell 'em it's your big day, and they'll hook you up with some handmade chocolates. Follow 'em on Facebook too. They post pictures of new grub and desserts a few times a week.

Their pretzel, perfectly salted and paired with a tangy mustard, hits the spot. \n\nWhen it comes to beers, I stick to what I know and love. Kiltlifter, a classic, and 8th St. Ale, another favorite. But come pumpkin porter season, I'm all in. \n\nThe atmosphere at Four Peaks is inviting. The patio, spacious and comfortable, perfect for sipping a cold one on a sunny day.

No sir, they've got the good stuff, and at prices that'll make you wonder how they're making a profit. I'm talking high-end wineries like Chimney Rock, Duckhorn, Rombauer, Pine Ridge, and more.

You're paying top dollar for mediocre wine, just because some fancy-pants sommelier says it's good. But at Total Wine, you're getting the same great wine for a fraction of the cost. And if you're lucky enough to live near one of their stores, well, you're in wine heaven, my friend. \n\nBut let's not get carried away here. I mean, it's still Vegas, after all. A city that'll suck the life out of you and leave you for dead. But hey, if you're already here, or just passing through, it's worth a stop to stock up the ol' cellar.

Vomiting, headache, the works. I saw this bus driving around town, Hangover Heaven, and decided to give it a shot. Dr. Burke came to my house within 45 minutes, hooked me up to an IV with some anti-nausea meds, and an hour later, I was feeling 100% better. Worth every penny.

And let's not forget the two stairways leading to the sick roof top deck. It's a great spot to grab a drink and enjoy the view. \n\nNow, about that banana bread beer... it's a must-try. It's got a strong banana flavor without being too sweet, served in a large glass. Kudos to them for brewing their own beers.

Plain lo-mein's actually plain, no veggies or nonsense. Give this place another shot, it's worth it. Decor's a bit off, like 50's Chinese diner chic, but who gives a damn?

3. Rooms decked out with TV and movie pics, ours had Days of our Lives (perfect for my buddy, the bachelorette).
4. Clean rooms, comfy beds, big bathrooms for getting ready.

6. Friendly staff, helpful concierge, tried to find $10 steak and lobster.
7. Feel like a celeb walking through, living large.
8. Miracle Mile shops for the shopaholic.

It was damn reasonable, so I got it done then and there! Wouldn't hesitate to send any BMW owner to Andrew and his crew. They treated my baby Z4 like it was their own.",True

""Aquaknox, a mainstay on the Strip for near a decade, never failed to impress. Frequent diners, my family and I, have sampled the finest fare Vegas has to offer, from Joel Robuchon to N9NE, and Aquaknox stands tall among them. Their service, with Min at the helm, is top-notch, going above and beyond to ensure satisfaction. When my mother requested a pina colada, Min personally fetched a blender from a neighboring joint. Their seafood dishes are a cut above, especially the steamed mussels, lobster cocktail, sweet shrimp and crab salad, and the divine lobster bisque. Save room for the filet mignon and surf 'n turf, and don't pass on the Pacific prawns and red snapper. Aquaknox delivers an exceptional dining experience.""",True

Weekends, families, dogs, kids, old folks, young blood, sharing tales, enjoying the performer du jour. Misters on the patio, nice touch. Nooks and crannies, prime real estate. Sandwiches, solid. Turkey on dark rye with avocado, my jam. Pricey? Yeah, but the free concert on weekends makes up for it. Kids run wild, dogs bark, good times. Friendly waitstaff, some been there for ages. Not for the fancy sandwich crowd, this place is for fun, relaxation, and good eats.""",True

""Love Downtown Vegas, aka the 9th island. LA girl with Hawaiian roots, so when in Vegas, gotta hit up the Cal for a taste of home. Local grindz at Market Street Cafe and Aloha Specialties, ONO! \n\nIf you ain't from Hawaii, might not get why a 30-something like me wants to hang at the Cal. It's like a Hawaiian Cocoon, old Japanese and locals from Hawaii gambling with wheelchairs and oxygen tanks, they go! \n\nBeen staying at the Cal since I was a keiki, nostalgic as hell, lot of memories. Love seeing the mixed faces and pidgin accents, it's like home. And let's not forget, I've been brainwashed since kid time that I'll win big if I play at a Sam Boyd hotel. Last visit, won 1000 quarters on Wheel of Fortune, must've been that shaka buddha belly rub. \n\nCatch you in March 2014, yay!""",True

Yesterday, I visited this place for the first time with my mom, who's been here a few times before. She only had good things to say about it. Here are my thoughts:

1. Service - Everyone was super friendly and helpful, including the valet.
2. Facility and grounds - Clean and tidy, with a great clean-up crew.
3. Rooftop pool - Amazing! Not too much chlorine, and it felt like they used a water softener. Nice to swim in.
4. Experience - Quiet and relaxing. My masseuse, Linda, was great. Friendly, considerate, and strong. :)",True

She's a real gem and mixes a mean rum drink too. The neighborhood might be a little sketchy at night, but hey, that's part of the charm. Watching her hustle made me appreciate my desk job even more. When I left, she actually tried to give me some of my tip back, saying I'd given her too much. I told her she was worth every penny and then some.

I had the avocado BLT and my friend had the V burger, both with a few cold ones on the side. When the grub arrived, the bartender noticed my friend's burger was a little more done than he liked and offered to swap it out. But my friend was good with it, so the bartender made sure the kitchen knew to keep an eye on the temp. Great vibes, Belgian brews, killer burgers, and fresh greens. Thanks, Brasserie V!""",True

A sea of people waited outside, but we were seated within 10 minutes. We scoped out other tables, and the portions were massive. Split a meal, and you'll still leave full. Our table of three ordered the tractor driver combo, corned beef hash, and eggs benedict. Everything was delicious. I added a Bloody Maria to my French toast breakfast, and it hit the spot. First time having one, and it was a game-changer. Tequila instead of vodka, and it settled my stomach and cured my hangover.

I had a 2002 Land Cruiser with stripped spark plugs, and other mechanics were trying to gouge me for over $2,000 to fix it. Andre took the time to actually problem-solve and got them out without damaging my engine, all for just over $200. That's when I knew this guy was different. Ever since, I've taken my car to him exclusively. Recently, he told me I needed some pricey repairs. Now, I trust Andre, but I also know he's got a business to run. So, I decided to get a second opinion. Another mechanic diagnosed the same issues and wanted to charge me even more.

""Great joint! Used to hit up the regular boba spot, but this place? Fell hard. Strawberry egg pudding and honey boba, ice cold, sweet, and creamy. Cups are huge, depending on the size.

""Pizza fiend here. Always been a sucker for a good slice. But I'm not picky, just your average cheese pizza kinda gal. That was until I hit up Grampa's. They got some wild combos, let me tell ya. The Goomba? Off the charts. Cheese, garlic cream sauce, fresh herbs. It's like a party in my mouth. And don't even get me started on The Brassacre. Two thumbs way up. If you're new to this joint, start with one of those. \n\nAtmosphere's on point too. Feels like a swanky city spot, perfect for dates or hangin' with buddies. Give it a shot. You won't regret it.""",True

Service has always been top-notch.""",True

Service - It's alright. Got to grab the server's attention, but I get it, they're busy. Acrobatics, that's what they do. They know their beers, no doubt. 

Ambiance - Small place, tight fit. But the vibe's relaxed, people are happy. Not for the claustrophobic.""",True

The foul dip over hummus, not even on the menu, mind you, was the real deal. We left with enough chow for a week. My boyfriend, never a fan of hummus before, wanted to dive headfirst into the Jerusalem salad, it was that good. Can't wait to hit it up again.""",True

Share the tuna tartare, it's small but damn good. Bone in rib steak, 20 oz, and you'll be glad you shared it. Best steak I've had, no sauce needed. Charred to perfection. Mac n cheese trio, off the menu, is worth it. Truffle mac n cheese, my fave. Brussels sprouts with bacon, also off the menu, are tasty. Drinks are pricey, FYI. Service is A+, our server was friendly and attentive.""",True

We got heapin' helpin's of grub, and the highlight was my scrawny, finicky daughter chowin' down on three garlic knots, a slice of pizza, two meatballs, and a cannoli. My nephew was a mite unruly, but they still hooked him up with a cookie at the end of his meal. They treat you like kin, and feed you like you've never been fed before.

Joint's a bit rough around the edges, but that's the charm. Parking's tight, but there's a convenience store next door for your Flamin' Hot needs. Price is right, too. My gyro was a steal at $4.60, and they've got a dollar menu with some tempting options. I'm putting my name on their gyros, no question. Highly recommend this spot.

My friend had the Steak Frank, I had a mint cookies n cream milkshake. The hot dog, according to my friend, was top-notch. The smell alone told you it was a real, all-beef dog. My shake took a bit, but worth it. Perfectly mixed, not too thick or thin. Prices are reasonable, you'll spend less than at McDonald's and get food that's 100 times better. Happy Hour during the week, 2-4 pm, shakes are half price. My only gripe, the location isn't 24/7. Hopefully, they'll change that soon, they'd be swamped at any hour.""",True

Even tried their gluten-free cupcakes, though I only lost five pounds on that cleanse diet. But hey, their cakes? Best in town. Fresh, delicious, beautifully detailed. And the presentation?

Just to make sure, I decided to get a second opinion from Professional Brake Service. They had rave reviews online, so I figured they'd give me the lowdown. Mary, one of the owners, greeted me warmly at the front desk. She made sure I got top-notch service. Their techs took a gander at my brakes and found that my front discs were good to go, and my rear drums still had some life left. Most joints would've sold me unnecessary services, but these folks were straight shooters. Mary suggested an adjustment, which I could score with a coupon from their site. Plus, future tweaks were on the house, so I could swing by every 3-6 months without breaking the bank. Not bad. If you need brake work, hit up Professional Brake Service.

We left happy, but also a tad sad to bid adieu to Heid and the rest of our Montreal pals. Herremannen, smitten with the bakery, picked up some flowers from the neighboring florist to show his gratitude. We'll be back for more chocolate croissants and fruit tarts. That's a promise.",True
