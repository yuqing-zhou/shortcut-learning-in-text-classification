""Birthday stay turned sour. $800 in'savings'? More like false promises. Free dinner, but that's where the perks ended. No fridge, no microwave, and hellish elevators. Random guests banging on my door every two hours, looking for drugs. 'Not my problem, buddy. Try the rappers next door.' Overpriced convenience store. Basic needs cost an arm and a leg. Walking shoes recommended, not heels. Lesson learned.""",True

""Went to the Wells Fargo branch to settle some affairs of my late husband's. Asked for help, but they wouldn't give it. Said it was up to the manager's discretion, whatever that means. Called their customer service, got some runaround about federal regulations. They wouldn't even take checks from a government agency or recognize court documents. What a joke. That place is toxic. Closed my accounts and said goodbye to Wells Fargo for good.""",True

""Bouchon used to be one of my top picks in Vegas. Not anymore. Tonight sealed the deal. Our party of six sent two entrees back - both short ribs, fatty as hell. Replaced 'em with lamb and strip steak. Better, but still subpar for a place with Keller's rep. Other dishes? Meh. Duck, gnocchi, forgettable. Overpriced too. Bouchon needs to step up its game. Won't be going back.""",True

""Terrible service at 3 PM on a slow day. No one checked on us for 15 minutes, and we stood up front waiting. Once seated, Luke, our server, was great. He made solid drink and taco recommendations. The street corn appetizer was a waste of four bucks. Small, oily, and lacking flavor. I expected more for the price. I had shrimp and Al Pastor tacos with saffron rice and burnt plantains. The tacos were decent, but the plantains were overcooked and stuck together. The saffron rice had hard rice clusters. Disappointing experience overall. Giving the South Park location a try.""",True

""Four years passed before I returned to that accursed restaurant. The Bloody Mary, once a delight, had become a bitter disappointment. It left me heaving at the airport, and the memories still lingered upon my return home. Sigi, our charming server, couldn't salvage the disaster. The food, covered in sterling silver, resembled a failed art project from a preschooler's hand. My chicken noodle soup? Sweet and unappetizing, with undercooked pasta and dirty carrots. Spicy buffalo wings? Dry and flavorless, breaking apart into soft lumps. Even a seasoned inmate would turn up their nose. I suffered for twelve hours afterward, regretting my decision to dine there. Skip America, indeed.""",True

""Techno beat pulsed through my skull like a jackhammer, relentless and unforgiving. No respite, no variation, just the same monotonous rhythm that made me want to pull my hair out. And don't even get me started on the lack of R&B or hip-hop. It was like they were trying to torture me with their narrow-minded playlist. I mean, what kind of establishment doesn't have some sort of diversity in their music selection? It was like they were trying to drive me insane. Needless to say, I didn't stick around too long.""",True

""Hundreds of restaurants, seen 'em all. But this one? Worst. Thirty seconds in, felt like they didn't care. Twenty minutes to get acknowledged? Ridiculous. Saw other couples get the same treatment. Walked out, along with two others. Disgrace to hardworking owners who give a damn. Food? Garbage. Meat on the plate? They couldn't even be bothered to use tongs. Cheapskates. Avoid this dump at all costs.""",True

""I got a 'lean machine' from some joint, and man, it was vile. Tasted like they dumped a whole pharmacy into it. Made my hairs stand up and gave me the shakes. I tried mixin' it up, but no dice. It was a waste of cash, had to toss it. Never again, buddy. Don't you dare order that swill.""",True

Next door to Cheddars, had a real meal.""",True

""Hell's bells, I never thought I'd find myself at a joint that sucked this bad. The security? Total butt-suckers. Rude as hell, unfriendly as a rabid dog. I've been to high-end clubs, dive bars, hired and fired security, but this place takes the cake. They're so rude, it's laughable. Got shoved outta there, hard. Some fat dude pinched my arm and told me I was getting escorted out 'cause I had my boot off and couldn't put it back on ( thanks to the crowd floating in the air). What the actual hell? Been to exclusive clubs in London and NY, this place is worse than a finger up my butt. I'd rather have my butt hair plucked than go back there. It's a damn shame, too. Great setting, awesome dancers, fantastic DJ, nice promoters, bartenders with smiles. But those security jerks? No way, man. Never going back, and neither should you.""",True

""Took the fam to this joint for Mother's Day, and boy, was it a bust. They were understaffed, overbooked, and the heat was sweltering. Fans were busted, misters weren't working yet. Servers were too busy to even fill our water glasses. And we had to wait 30 minutes for our table, which was just a generic, mass-produced mess. To top it off, the hostess burst into the bathroom, letting out a colorful language when she found both stalls occupied. Problem was, my five-year-old niece was in one of 'em. Staff's behavior? Manic and panicked. Sorry to give 'em a bad review, but they let me down hard.""",True

Receptionist says $35. My Groupon was $30, supposed to be worth $70. Damn, I saved five bucks. \n\nThing is, they gotta give Groupon clients the same service as regulars.

If anyone asks, I'll send 'em to Pinky's and make sure my foodie pals know where to grab a real burger on Montford. Don't waste your dough...\n\nAnd let me tell you, those reviewers who claim they've got great burgers clearly haven't been to Brooks (Charlotte's answer to Price's Chicken Coop) or The Liberty (high-end burgers that'll blow your mind).

No stars, wouldn't return.""",True

When I went to pay with my debit card, they said they didn't accept it. Unbelievable. I handed over a different card and left a five-dollar tip in cash. My nails looked uneven and not what I wanted. Never going back to that dump. The place was old, dirty, and tacky. Horrible customer service and questionable hygiene. Not worth the cheap price.""",True

""Vegas and Summerlin. Not exactly known for authentic Korean cuisine. But still, you'd think they could get the basics right. Like gochujang sauce for bibim bap. A staple, for crying out loud!

Don't know any waiter who'd work with just three tables for a decent night's pay. Waited forty-five minutes, finally got sat down. Food took an hour, still didn't get our drinks 'cause the waitress never came back after we ordered. Maybe she was on her period. Food was good, but overpriced for the small portion. Not worth it after two and a half hours.""",True

But they were dry, like the cook didn't know what they were doin' or the meat just wasn't good. My buddy said the regular burgers were better than the game meats. Salmon burger was alright too.

""Phoenix restaurants ain't impressed me much. Latest place, service was piss poor. Server's visits were brief, like they had somewhere better to be. We'd ask for stuff, they'd vanish, leaving us hanging. Food arrived, decent. Turkey eggs benedict, potatoes, fresh fruit. But that's where the good ended. No utensils, no condiments, no coffee refills. Place needs a total staff overhaul. Food ain't enough to keep 'em afloat.""",True

Pepporcini pepper sauce or Cholula sauce, no way. Meat, unseasoned. Chicken tenders, potatoes, biscuits, tasteless. Couldn't eat it, love fried food. Felt bad for 'em, lotta food left. Add salt and pepper, at least.""",True

The sun beat down on my neck as I stood in the Home Depot parking lot, waiting for someone - anyone - to come and assist me in the electrical department. Thirty minutes passed, and not a single soul had bothered to lift a finger. Finally, a customer service representative sauntered over, a look of indifference plastered across his face.

""I paged the person,"" he said, as if that were some sort of accomplishment. ""What else can I do?""

I glared at him, my anger simmering just below the surface. ""You can start by getting me some help,"" I snapped. ""I've been standing here for half an hour, and no one has bothered to even acknowledge me.""

The representative shrugged, clearly unbothered by my plight. ""Sorry to hear that. Maybe you should try the Val Vista store. They might be able to help you out.""

I shook my head, incredulous. ""You're telling me to go to another store? After I've already wasted thirty minutes of my time waiting for someone to help me here?""

He nodded, his expression still blank. ""Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Sorry.""

Caulking was coming off, too. Not worth the price, if you ask me. TV was an old flat screen, and only half the channels worked. Breakfast was subpar, and they didn't clean up the tables, so nowhere to sit and eat. Pool area was cordoned off, and the parking lot had big chunks closed off, too. All in all, a bust. Wouldn't recommend it. When I checked out, the girl just said 'you're good to go' and kept eating her breakfast before walking away. Didn't even ask how my stay was.""",True

Since then, the owner has contacted me multiple times, trying to convince me to change my review. I find his approach inappropriate and borderline harassment. I declined his offer of a refund.

""Pizza joints like this one got me shakin' my head. Folks in ritzy neighborhoods'll gobble up anything that's in their neck of the woods. Let's get real, folks. This pizza was a dud, and an overpriced one at that. Crust? Charred and burnt, what's the point? Sauce? Flavorless. Cheese? Cooked to a dry, papery mess. Pepperoni? Thick and dime-sized, not exactly Italian. And don't even get me started on the single, dried-out basil leaf. I could whip up a better pizza with a Pillsbury biscuit, ketchup, and Kraft cheese. And don't even get me started on the lack of ranch dressing. People, this is just another chain restaurant with a gimmick. Don't fall for it. Go get a real pizza, try Montesanos, Villa on Sahara and Valley View, or Metro. The noise level and bright lighting alone should be enough to turn you off.

""I never thought I'd be reviewing a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, but here I am. I've worked for them before, and I've been to plenty of other cafes, so I'm usually pretty understanding when it comes to baristas. But this place was different. My girlfriend and I stopped by for a quick coffee before checking out of our hotel. They had one girl taking orders, supposedly to speed up the line. We ordered a regular hazelnut iced coffee and a large Orchard Peach iced tea. We paid and waited for our drinks. What we got was two regular-sized drinks. Not a big deal, right? Wrong. When we told the barista about the mistake, she gave us an attitude and said we had paid for a regular size drink. She didn't seem to care that we had specifically asked for a large iced tea. And then she just walked away. I guess conflict resolution isn't their strong suit. It's too bad, because a simple apology and remake of our order would have avoided all of this. Instead, we left with a bad taste in our mouths. Moral of the story? Double and triple check your order when you ring up, because they won't fix it for you.""",True

I reckon it's popular for reasons unknown. Their pancakes, though, ain't half bad - crispy on the edges, cooked in some questionable substance that leaves me feeling queasy. Forgettable coffee, passable eggs, chewy bacon, and limp lyonnaise potatoes round out the menu. If you're dragged here, find new friends. If you can't, opt for pancakes with whipped cream to counterbalance the machine-made fat. Better options in Pittsburgh include Coca Caf\u00e9 or Square Caf\u00e9 for a nicer breakfast, or DeLuca's or JoJo's for a greasier spoon.

It was delicious and the best I've had in Las Vegas. \n\nThe service was friendly and attentive. \n\nHowever, I must advise against asking for tap water. It's unfiltered and hard. Bottled water is the better choice. \n\nIn summary, the food at Max's in Las Vegas is unimpressive and overpriced. I wouldn't return for the entrees unless they add the Beef Caldereta to the menu. But I would come back for the Halo-Halo. My suggestion for Max's is to lower their prices and serve more authentic dishes.""",True

I signed up for their rewards program, hoping to get some free play out of it. But all I got was $10, and it could only be used on a handful of machines that were scattered throughout the casino. And of course, those machines were always busy. It was like they were taunting me, dangling the possibility of free play just out of reach.

Overall, this casino was a disappointment. It was my least favorite in the area, and I won't be rushing back anytime soon. The smoke was overwhelming, and the lack of available machines made it hard to enjoy myself. I'll stick to other casinos from now on.",True

You step in the tub after walkin' on that carpet, you'll leave black footprints. No excuse for that kinda filth, and no excuse for ignoring it and shovin' it onto the next guy. Hotel's old and it smells like it too. They're tryin' to fix it up, but they got a long way to go. With all the nice hotels in Vegas, I can't figure out why anyone'd wanna stay here. First and last time for me. Never been treated so poorly. A kennel'd be cleaner. One good thing though, Junius Johnson, Jr. He's a server in the buffet, been there 30 years. Guy's got customer service down pat. He should teach the rest of the staff. My hat's off to him.""",True

Moe's serves unremarkable grub. It doesn't hold a candle to others in its class—Qdoba, Chipotle, et al. The victuals were fresh, but lacked pizzazz. Burritos were puny, with scant fillings. My main gripe was the price. No way a burrito of that size, with that meager amount of rice, beans, and meat, should cost north of seven bucks for the regular size. I've had larger, tastier burritos for around five bucks. A small soda for two-fifty? Ridiculous (free refills, though).

You do get chips and salsa with your order. The chips were decent. Salsa, just okay. One strange thing: my wife ordered a Triple Lindy burrito in a bowl. It came in a white box. When you try to toss it, you can't fit the box in the trash can due to its odd design. Brainiac move...

Within two minutes, someone showed up. They were still slow, but not as bad as before. It took almost thirty minutes from the time I arrived to when I finally got my two items.

We swung by this joint in Phoenix after hearing good things. Got there around 8:30 on a Friday night, and there was only one other couple ahead of us, so we were served quick.

Service was decent, but the employee who helped us seemed a bit tired or something. Like they'd been working a long shift or somethin'.

Ice cream wise, my husband went for the TC^2 and salted caramel, while I got the almond buttercrunch and apple cinnamon. Also tried the honey blue cheese and sugar and spice. Didn't get much almond flavor outta the almond buttercrunch, but the other flavors were alright. Texture was a bit icy, not super creamy like I'd hoped.

Pricing was reasonable, but I wouldn't go outta my way for this ice cream. If you're in the area and want some ""original"" flavors for a decent price, might be worth stoppin' in.

Meat selection was weak and overpriced. And three bucks for a Coke? Ridiculous. We'll stick to the good stuff and make the trip to Via or Texas next time.""",True

The burger was flavorless. I get the unlimited toppings thing, but even A-1 sauce, chipotle, and banana peppers couldn't mask the dry, ground beef taste. Cheeburger, step up your game! Chili's has its own flavor! I was let down, but I'm over it now since I won't be coming back.""",True

""Place was decent. Never been here before, surprisingly. Hit the buffet, $8.50 with soda, give or take. Reminded me of Shakey's, but not quite up to par. Like Chuck E. Cheese, but a step above. Salad bar was basic, but I liked the peperoni. Pasta was spaghetti and elbow macaroni, two sauce options. Ragu, but a bit better. Chicken and potato wedges were the same, tasted the same too. First round, no pizza. Second round, pizza was mediocre, pre-cooked sausage, lots of grease. If I had kids, might come back after sports games, otherwise, no plans to return.""",True

""Echo Canyon renovation? More like desecration. Used to be my go-to trail, now it's a disappointment. Parking's a nightmare, worse than before. Went on a Thursday afternoon, park rangers still turning folks away. Barricade's a joke, only lets in five cars at a time, blocks the main road. Poor planning, if you ask me. Trail itself? Stairs are gone, replaced with steep gravel. Slippery as hell, not good for the out-of-shape crowd. Dogs? Forget about it, not allowed no more. Shame, really. Echo Canyon's lost its charm.""",True

""Yalla opened near my house, and I was stoked. We needed a solid Mediterranean spot, and it being owned by Khoury's, my favorite, was a bonus.  Ordered a few things - roasted chicken sandwich, Fatoush salad with chicken, beef kabobs. Rice was top-notch, crispy noodles, light oil. Hummus, too. Fatoush, tasty. Hubby, no complaints on the sandwich. But, some issues. Billed wrong, cashier apologetic but still overcharged me. Pita bread, not great either. Back though? Yeah.""

""Update: Went back, waited ten minutes behind another customer at the counter without a word from the cashier. Woman couldn't get her order together, and we were ignored. Left. Awful service.

Meats were just alright. Flank steak was good, chicken was good, sirloin was okay but bland, pork was good, lamb was okay, alligator (yep, alligator) was decent. First time tryin' it. \nAtmosphere was a letdown. Website made it look like a fancy 4 or 5-star place, but it was more like a Golden Corral inside. Not exactly a place to impress the missus. Plus, it smelled like an Indian restaurant, since it's split in half - Indian on one side, Braza's on the other. Service was good though. Friendly staff, wanted us to have a good time. Pricing was around $40-45 per person. Felt like I could do better elsewhere for that price.""",True

Chinese food should pop with flavor, fresh veggies, vibrant colors. This was none of that. Had the pork and tofu hot pot - plain and boring, lots of pork, iceberg lettuce? Ordered the shrimp pan-fried noodles too...bland, just wasn't good. Figure the chefs here don't give a damn no more. All in all, underwhelming experience.

Ordered some alligator tail as an appetizer and it was tasty. But the all-you-can-eat platters we usually get were only good towards the end. Seemed like they were usin' old oil to fry the fish and shrimp at first...yuck! Don't even wanna think about how old it was. But hey, at least they changed the oil to fresh oil at the end, so that was good.

The salad bar was pretty lackluster too. Coulda used some more maintenance, ya know? Maybe put the same items on both sides to make it easier to navigate without spillin' stuff everywhere. Did like how they kept the plates chilled though.

Two of us had the crispy fried game hen, which was nothing special, and the other four went with the Niman skirt steak. Sides didn't come until we asked, and they were just zucchini and mac and cheese. Dessert was either freshly baked cookies or a trio of sorbets. Cookies were good, but nothing impressive. Got hit with a bunch of extra fees on the bill, including a charity donation and an upcharge for the appetizers. Didn't notice any mention of it on the online menu or when we ordered. Not worth it.

Didn't seem too sure about the gluten-free stuff, though. Asked the kitchen if I could have the nachos, they said yeah, but I prob'ly shoulda been more careful 'cause of the language barrier. Heard the kitchen staff talkin' and it sounded like they weren't too sure either.

Went with the nachos anyway, they were pretty good. Chicken, cilantro sauce, nacho cheese, and jalapeños. Good-sized portion, took some leftovers with me for later. Didn't get sick, so I guess the nachos are okay here. Other notes, heard another customer complain about dirty silverware, mine was alright.

We dined at Rao's last week, anticipating a legendary experience. The joint itself is fun, decked out in old-timey Italian decor with celeb photos on the walls. Service was top-notch, attentive and professional. Food was good, but not great. Seemed like the kitchen played it too safe, serving up ample portions of slightly above-average entrees. My veal dish was solid, but didn't live up to the hype. Rao's has potential, with a fun setting, great servers, and decent grub. They just need to step up their game in the kitchen. A little tweak in prep would go a long way. Hope they take note, 'cause it's a fun spot with good people.",True

Yesterday, I visited this establishment and was disappointed. Our server was friendly, but the food was subpar. I ordered the lunch special with pizza and tomato basil soup, while my cousin got a beer. However, the beer took an eternity to arrive, and when it did, it was lackluster. The pizza was also unimpressive, with old and dry cheese. The saving grace was the delicious tomato basil soup, which my 3-year-old and I mostly devoured. Unfortunately, the rest of the meal was forgettable, and I wouldn't recommend this Yard House Restaurant.",True

I ordered Jack Daniels ribs and shrimp. Shrimp were great. Ribs? Don't order 'em unless it's a BBQ joint. Dry as hell. Some parts were decent, but most left me thirsty af.

My wife got the steak. Biggest part was fat. What's the point?

There was this huge party next to us, got drunk as hell. Loud, obnoxious. Couldn't hear myself think. Don't mind noise, but c'mon, not in a restaurant. Seemed like the manager and servers didn't give a damn, though. Guess that's just how it goes there.

Ingredients are suspect too - my raspberry shake tasted a bit chemically, and there weren't any seeds to speak of. Not sure if the milk's hormone-free either.

My buddy shows up, we order, and the waitress is real nice. Food's not bad, but it ain't hot and could use some more flavor. Meat's cooked good, but there's a ton of onions compared to the meat. Rice is just plain boring.

They had a sweet elevator that took us up to the restaurant, and the modern Asian decor was impressive. Our waiter and bussers were top-notch, always filling our sake glasses. I went for their special California roll, freshwater eel roll, and adobo chicken roll. The grub was good, but the atmosphere and vibe were worth the price. I figure the chef must be Filipino, since they had lumpia, pancit, and adobo on the menu. One of the staff even asked if I was related to the chef. Didn't know all Filipinos were family.

That's when it's a good spot to chill, especially outside in the summer. \n\nYou'll find the usual Southside bar crawl crew here, but if you're lookin' for fancy vibes, why bother with the Southside? People are friendly, service is quick if you can grab the bartender's attention, but drinks can be pricey, especially shots. \n\nAll the same, I reckon Local's alright for a night of drinkin' and cussin', provided the weather's nice and it ain't too packed.""",True

Came for breakfast, wanted the stuffed French toast. No peanut butter for me, please. Asked for Nutella and banana instead. No problem. Thought I was getting Nutella, but it wasn't as dark.

Guns looked worn out. Ear protection sucked, my ears hurt. Shot Uzi, Thompson, two other automatics, and a Desert Eagle handgun. Bachelor shot grenade launcher, but it's not a real grenade, just a shotgun shell. Best quote from the store: 'You mean Obama poster?' when we pointed at an Osama Bin Laden poster.

Computer glitch gave me a nice surprise - three bucks for my first drink. Second round, no such luck, but the bartender gave me a heads up. Stayed for the nine o'clock burger special. Damn good. Double burger, Stack'd special sauce - highly recommend.""",True

""Gave it 3.75. Tucked away under shady apartments on 7th, it's a cool little breakfast joint. Sat at the bar, ate. Kitchen's tiny, but cookin's decent. Had eggs and bacon, can't go wrong. Other dishes looked great. Pancakes next time? Definitely coming back.""",True

Second course was pasta with a meat sauce. That was the best dish, no question. Entree was a flat iron steak. Good, not amazing. Dessert was blue cotton candy and chocolate cake w banana gelato. Cotton candy was a nice touch. \n\nBut, man, the wine pairings were a real bummer. Waiter didn't know much about 'em and gave us the same pairings no matter what we ordered. Soup or salad and fish or steak. All reds, too. \n\nOverall, presentation was good, portions were good, service was alright, food was alright. But nothin' special. If you're lookin' for a real stand-out joint, I'd suggest Alto at the Hyatt Gainey Ranch instead.""",True

Zumanity's no Absinthe, but it's not bad either. It's got some raunchy jokes and topless acts, but it's mostly tame and a bit campy. I took the boyfriend and he enjoyed it, but he didn't see what the big deal was about Cirque du Soleil. Maybe I was expecting something more extreme, like O. The comedy's mostly heckling the crowd and some of the acts weren't even there. No midgets or fat twins. Maybe that would've spiced things up. It's a typical Cirque show with some dirty jokes and sexier outfits. Not bad for 50% off tickets for military though.",True

My first time at the gun range. Fun, sure. But let's get down to business. Pros and Cons, that's what I'm looking at.

Pros:

* Knowledgeable staff. They knew their stuff, no question.
* Plenty of firepower. You want to shoot something? They got it.

Cons:

* Busy. That's a good thing for them, but you'll wait. Weekends, especially.
* Small. People sitting on the floor, standing in corners. Shoulder to shoulder.
* Flustered range officers. Overwhelmed, trying to keep up. Can't blame 'em. Thirty people with rifles and pistols walking in all at once? No thanks.
* Price. Expensive. Shared a lane and gun with my sisters for 30 minutes. $88. Heard it was $15 per gun. Not worth it.

Not a bad place to visit if you're curious about ranges. Just remember: small size, long lines. That's the truth.",True

""Shrimp Pad Thai, that's what I was after. Google led me to this place. Ordered for pick-up, ready in 15 minutes. Parking? Down a dark alleyway. Guy smoking in the corner gave me a start. Maybe park on Spring and walk around to Valley instead. Inside, friendly staff, inviting atmosphere. Dish was damn good, spicy level 4. Noodles were thin, like angel hair, shrimp small. A bit disappointed, but still tasty. Next time, I'll order larger shrimp. That's how it goes.""",True

""Cozy joint, dig the various rooms and seating areas. Patio's gotta be sweet in the warm months. Lost a star for a couple things though. First, they poured the cream for me without asking. Would've preferred skim milk, but oh well. Second, the music's a radio station with obnoxious ads. Just play some tunes, ya know? Don't need to hear about $7.99 haircuts while sippin' joe. Coffee was solid, food looked good, but prices were a bit steep. Beer's cool, but the pizza banner's a little confusing. Pick a lane, ya feel me? All in all, not bad.""",True

Let's just say the burgers were nothing special. Mine was overcooked and lacked flavor, my boyfriend thought his was forgettable. The tots? Handmade, sure, but they missed the mark too. They had potential with the cheese and herb cream cheese, but they were dull and overpriced at three bucks for seven bits. There are better burger joints around.

The joint was hoppin', but we got sat quick and our waiter was on the ball. I went for the 12oz strip, medium rare. It took a bit, but when it came, it was overcooked.

We hit up this joint, an old-school spot with a restaurant, casino, and brewery, a few times. It's a real jack-of-all-trades, but their breakfast game is on point - steak and eggs for under four bucks, can't beat that. They also brew their own root beer, and let me tell you, it's some good stuff. Not a place I'd stay at or gamble at, but it's a solid choice for a cheap meal and a good time. Last time I went with my father-in-law, we had a coupon for all-you-can-drink beer for an hour, no purchase necessary. We crushed 22 Coronas, not too shabby.",True

Went to this joint for dinner last night. Three courses and a glass of vino for ten quid, not bad. Service was top-notch, both the greeter and waitress were friendly and attentive. Sardine starter and hake main course with a side of spinach, all cooked to perfection. Presentation was on point too.

Minor gripe, the cheese board could've used a few more oatcakes and some more onion marmalade. Brie was a bit dried out and the cheese knife looked like it's seen better days. Handle was cracked near the base of the blade.

Pizza was pretty good, had some caramelized onions, mushrooms, Italian sausage, and a good crust. Not too crispy, not too soft, but you definitely need a fork and knife for it.

Yesterday, I visited this place to catch a postseason game with some fellow Yelpers. The joint was decent, with plenty of TVs and a non-smoking entrance for those who prefer fresh air. But, if you wanna shoot some stick or use the men's room, you gotta brave the smoky patio. Speaking of which, the men's room could use a good scrubbin'. My feet stuck to the floor like glue.

They had a nice selection of beers on tap, but I was hankerin' for a burger. Turns out, the table orders were plentiful, so I settled for some nachos, hot wings, an onion ring, a potato skin, and a cheese stick. Solid bar grub, but nothing too impressive. Service was hit or miss - sometimes attentive, other times MIA.

Yeah, weird. \n\nI went for the Broiled Whitefish Taco Platter ($6) and a side of Shrimp Skewers ($4). That shrimp skewer, man, add some lemon juice, hot sauce, and that's a meal.

We hadn't been to this joint since it was still Cafe Del Sol. We had a Groupon we bought a month ago, so we figured, why not? It was a little weird since there's a main dining room and a separate room for the red-headed stepchild, but whatever.

I ended up getting another glass of wine, don't remember the name, but it was alright. I got the short ribs with cola and pineapple, jalapeno cream corn, and chile corn casserole. The sides were decent, but the corn casserole was a bit dry. The short ribs were great though, didn't have that cheap pot roast taste. The sauce was a bit too thick for my liking, but not a big deal. My wife had the grilled shrimp appetizer with avocado and mango sauce, and the empanadas. She loved her food, but I wasn't a fan of the empanadas. The shrimp were pretty good though.

First off, they didn’t tell us where to sit for the happy hour prices. I mean, come on, who thinks to ask that? So we sat wherever we wanted, and turns out it was the wrong spot. Only the bar and bench are for happy hour, but they didn’t bother telling us that either. Nice job, fellas. You lost a star just like that.\n\nNow, the grub. It was alright, I guess. Had some good stuff, like the Patatas Bravas. Just some roasted taters covered in tomato sauce, but it hit the spot. The lamb was decent too, but small for the price. Croquettes were a bit meh. And don’t even get me started on the red sangria. It was like they just poured some wine and fruit juice into a glass and called it a day. Not impressed. \n\nSo, the bill comes and it’s about $60 sans tip. Turns out we paid extra for sitting at a table instead of the bar. Like, what even is that? Happy hour prices should be the same everywhere, you feel me? So yeah, that’s my two cents on this place. Service stinks, food’s alright. Maybe try it out for yourself, but don’t say I didn’t warn you.""",True

They've expanded their services, doing headlight replacements and belt changes now. Last time I went, I got an oil change, new air filter, and car wash for $47 after tax. They also do basic car washes for $3.99 and super washes for $7.99. I've only ever gotten the basic wash, and I've always found things they missed, so their quality isn't impressive.

I went for the Filipino-style corned beef and spuds, and my companion opted for the oxtail stew. Damn fine grub. It's a humble abode, nestled in a busy strip mall amidst a Chinese plaza. They got all sorts of other edibles for sale too. Name of the place translates to ""neighbor,"" but it's more like ""house-connected.""

Forgot about us at the end, had to be reminded by a busboy. Food was great though, Caeser salad, filet mignon meatballs, and Quatro Stagioni pizza, all delicious. Recommend the grub, not the service.""",True

""Enjoyed checking out The Dog empire during my extended weekend in Edinburgh.  Great concept, cool vibes, and solid grub.  Wished I had more time to sample everything!  \n\nHad a decent flank steak salad (2.5 stars), a bit chewy but the sweet balsamic reduction balanced the bitter arugula.  My man's mushroom risotto (4.0 stars) was rich and cooked to perfection.  Finished with tiramisu (3 stars), but it lacked the kick of espresso and the dark chocolate overpowered the light dessert.  Ended up scraping off the top.""",True

It's also the only joint open past 10 pm that's not in a casino and won't break the bank. A good spot for a low-key meal with a friend.

One guy even kept going after a woman stood up and told him to move on. What a jerk. But our MC saved the day, patching over those two disasters like a pro.

I wanted to love it, but it was just okay. Expectations were high after reading rave reviews on Pop's site. I envisioned a fun, delicious experience with a gruff but charming grill master asking me ""wit"" onions? in a genuine Philly accent. Instead, the grill master was just gruff and didn't hear my order. No onions on my cheese steak. 

The cheese steak itself? Meat wasn't fatty or greasy, but a bit bland. Enjoyed the cheese whiz and the bread was great. Including onions would've made it tastier. Since eating it, I've felt a bit off, but that's not always a sign of whether I'd return if the food's good. (Masochist!)

We returned from Mexico and Cuba, arriving at this airport for a brief stopover. The airport was simple to navigate, with clear signs leading the way. Immigration moved quickly, despite a long line. We had our research papers in order, but the officer barely glanced at us before stamping our passports and sending us on our way. We retrieved our luggage, zipped through customs, and rechecked our bags without issue. Security took the most time, thanks to lengthy lines. The staff worked diligently and remained pleasant. If we had more time, we would have grabbed some local BBQ for our San Francisco flight. Unfortunately, the security line consumed most of our spare time.

Waitress was friendly and attentive, replaced my water when she saw something floatin' in it, and my husband's glass was dirty too.

No free chips and salsa, which would be fine if they offered somethin' else like Barrio. No happy hour either, which was a bummer. Street corn was decent, but I've had better. Butternut squash tacos were amazing, my husband liked 'em more than his mahi tacos. Can't believe they got the balls to charge $12 for three tiny tacos, and $12 for guac made from two avocados.

""Been comin' here 'fore I moved to Vegas. Multi-level joint, packed all the time. Located way down at The Forum Shops, connected to Caesar's Palace.

Siam Terrace, a Thai restaurant in Urbana, is one of my favorites. Their red curry, my go-to dish, is a standout. Don't let that sway you, though - the rad nar, pad thai, and other options are also top-notch. It's not a five-star joint, but it's close. The atmosphere can feel a bit cramped with larger groups, but it's still a great spot. The appetizers are solid, with the shrimp being a highlight. It's affordable, too - prices start at around $8.99 for vegetarian, chicken, or tofu options, and a bit higher for meat entrees.",True

They got servers walking around with swords of meat, and you got a little disk to flip from red to green, meaning you're ready for more. The salad bar's got some great stuff too, like prosciutto and nice cheeses. And yeah, they got a full bar, and it's top-notch.""",True

Tried a few tacos at this joint, three for ten bucks. They were all different, but the Suadero Azteca, that's the queen's special, stood out. Damn thing was flavorful and tender, topped with some real good veggies. Get your own, don't share. Fried fish and shrimp were solid too. Great spot for some unique tacos, but it can add up.

Shared a couple carafes with a buddy. \n\nSplit some apps - Panzarotti and Fiori de Zucca. The fried zucchini was alright, but the Panzarotti was the real deal.

Friday nights, we hit this joint with the crew. Solid grub, the lamb meatballs and Johnny's nachos are our go-to. Their ranch dressing? Not bad, even for a non-ranch fan like me. Guinness stew? It's a winner.

But, it's a bit pricey for what it is. Beers start at six bucks, and most menu items are ten plus. Sandwiches? Twelve smackers. Shave a few bucks off, and they'd be in five-star territory.

I headed to downtown Vegas for a show, stopped for grub at Bar + Bistro. My bad, it was First Friday in the Arts District, and they had a limited menu. Oh well.

I went for two tapas plates and a sweet treat. Started with their roasted tomato soup - damn good. Then, their 5 cheese mac and cheese, a mix of smoked gouda, sharp cheddar, fontina, Manchego, roasted tomato, piquillo peppers, and parmesan crisp. Gigli pasta. Tasty stuff.

Finished with a warm chocolate ganache cake. Also, damn good. Came with a tiny scoop of sorbet. Perfect.

Personally, I dig Hemnes (real wood!). Bought it for my master bedroom, living room. Excellent results. Did Malm too (haven't we all?). Small investment, years of use.

""Grooming Salon. Katie, the cat handler. Hard to find cat groomers in this town. Vets offer the service, but after today's visit to Petsmart, I'll stick with Katie. She's got a way with cats, even the demon ones. My cat, Josie, is a handful. Adorable with me, but afraid of all pet workers. No idea why. Katie works Tuesday through Friday, starting at 7 am. Perfect. No one else needs to witness the drama my cat puts on. Called ahead to see if Katie could shave Josie's haunches. Didn't want bits clinging to her backside. Gross. Katie put an E-collar on Josie and scruffed her while she worked. Fine by me. The cat was screaming like a murder victim, otherwise, she'd be embarrassing. Job done in less than ten minutes. $6 well spent. Vet suggested sedating Josie and declawing her. Inhumane. Katie's the first professional to work with Josie...professionally. My cat's a total freak, but I can't shave her ass myself. Thank God for Katie at Petsmart. Seriously.""",True

Now, if you wanna make some memories, hit this place up on a Tuesday night. They got this trivia thing going on and Kim, the gal who runs it, she's a real kick. The waitstaff, they're A-okay too. Friendly as can be. And they got some decent brews to choose from.",True

No breading issues here, just lightly coated and perfectly cooked onions that weren't too strong or sweet. And at $1.95, it was a steal. My only gripe was the small portion size, but that's easily fixed by going on the first Wednesday of the month for the $12.95 AYCE lunch buffet.

From hair care to junk food, they got it all. Even got some fancy tea to sip on. And when I was makin' pho from scratch, I found all the ingredients I needed in one spot. They got all sorts of herbs, spices, sauces, and powders. The place is spotless too. If you run into any language problems, just find someone who speaks English. Most of 'em do. \n\nTheir baked goods and deli items are top-notch. I grab pastries for lunch, and their dim sum's always a treat. Better than Orchid's Garden or Chang's, and way cheaper.

Good entertainment, Jabbawockeez, dancers from Fantasy, flying Santas, makes it a fun event. Walking over the freeway on Sunset, not something you do every day.

Wine selection? Limited. Mostly non-Spanish. What's up with that? They had one Rivera del Duero and one Rioja. Come on, it's a Spanish joint! Now, the coffee. Cold brew and kopi luwak, both solid.

It was a sweltering spring day in Chinatown and I was famished. I'd had enough of my usual Thai food and was eager to try something new. I stumbled upon HSP on Yelp and couldn't believe my eyes - had this place just opened? I made my way to the end of the Chinatown Plaza extension on Wynn Rd and Spring Mountain, where I found a small shop with a variety of poke bowls. The woman working there told me they'd been open for five years, and I felt like a fool for not knowing about it sooner. The quantities of poke were small, but that was a good sign - it meant the fish was fresh. I'm not from Hawaii or an islander, but I could tell the difference between fresh and funky fish. My Shoyu Limu Tuna bowl was delicious, with no trace of funk and only fresh, warm rice sprinkled with black sesame seeds. It was a steal at around $8. I couldn't wait to come back and try more.",True

All night long, we lost ourselves in the music, in the moment. Drinks flowed fast, everyone had a blast. This place, it's the spot for hip hop heads. We came back the next night, and it was just as good. I'll be back, every time I'm in Vegas.",True

It's got a retro vibe going on too. Sure, it's an older theater and the seats could use some work, but it's still a cool place to catch a movie.

Leith Links, a peaceful haven in north Edinburgh, offers a serene escape from the bustling city. Paths crisscross the expansive green space, playgrounds dot the landscape, and the atmosphere remains tranquil, even during busy times. Unlike the Meadows, Leith Links avoids crowds of picnicking students, providing a calmer environment for leisurely strolls, runs, or walking your furry friend. While the northeast corner may carry a slight scent due to nearby sewage works, the rest of the park delights the senses.

Allotments and a Children's Orchard thrive within the park's boundaries, adding vibrancy to the area. Visiting circuses and festivals like the Leith Festival in June and Edinburgh Mela in August further enliven the scene. Golf enthusiasts will appreciate that Leith Links, though no longer a golf course, holds the distinction of being the birthplace of golf's official rules. A unique blend of history and natural beauty, Leith Links beckons visitors to explore its charms.",True

Crepe was a bust, tasteless batter and sour berries. Candied nuts weren't fresh, had that refrigerated taste. Meat dishes were great, prime rib was cooked just right, pork apple dish was yummy.

Super White Tuna, fantastic too. Salmon and Hamachi, really good. Scallop, good. Conch, Halibut, and Sweet Shrimp, just OK. Lots of desserts included.

I stepped into The Boozery, a cozy joint nestled inside a shipping container, on a chilly winter evening. The bartender, a friendly bloke with a passion for whiskey, greeted me warmly.

As we sipped our drinks, I took in the surroundings - the small space was intimate, but the outdoor patio was where the real magic happened. It offered a prime spot to observe the hustle and bustle of Container Park, while the sun dipped below the horizon. What sets The Boozery apart?

We stepped into the bar on Las Vegas Boulevard, dodging the commotion of the strip. My pals and I were eager for a drink and a bite before hitting the cinema at South Point. Aware of the crowded casino, we opted for this spot. My initial visit was uninspiring, but this time proved improved. We settled into a side booth around 10 pm. The staff took their time acknowledging us, but once alerted, they became attentive.

The menu stretched far and wide, a double-edged sword. My first encounter left me unimpressed, particularly with their chili. However, the variety of salads won me over. On Thursdays, they feature BBQ chicken atop cold soba noodles, surrounded by a medley of vegetables. The marinade brought to mind Chinese-style BBQ, albeit saltier than sweeter. The half-portion, priced at 8.95, satisfied my hunger. I aimed for a healthy choice, yet couldn't resist swiping my friend's fries. Thick-cut and golden-brown, they were utter perfection.

An added bonus, the bar played an abundance of 90's alternative tunes. Smashing Pumpkins and Bush transported me back to my youthful days.",True

""Moon Doggies, a dive bar that's surprisingly clean, serves up grub that's worth trying. Chris, the owner of Naked City Pizza, told me it's a cool spot, mostly for industry folks. I took my hubs and dad there for lunch, and we skipped the pizza - I mean, when in Rome, right? We went for the buffalo wings instead, and they did not disappoint. They were cooked just how I like 'em, nice and hot. My old man loved his chili cheese hot dog, loaded with all the fixin's. The steak frites sub was a beast of a sandwich, packed with garlicky beef, creamy horseradish, and crispy fries. It came with a side of peppery gravy that hit the spot. Our lunch for three was $25, and we even took some home. I'll definitely be back soon to try the pizza!""",True

Hell yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about. Generous portions, too. My pops wasn't feelin' too hot, so I got him some jook - salted pork with thousand year old egg porridge. Not bad, nice balance of saltiness without bein' too watery. Later on, my old man had their curry beef. Can't say for sure how it was, but he cleaned his plate, so that's a good sign. Beef chow fun? Now we're talkin'. Lot of flavor, nice kick from the stove. A few other dishes, but overall, this tiny hole in the wall outside the strip's a solid find. And best part? Won't break the bank.""",True

Now, the tapas. They've got some real creative combos. I was impressed. Didn't even need to eat much, just wanted to try a couple things. Had the lamb lollipop, real tender and tasty. And the red snapper, man, that was good. Came with mussels in a saffron broth, real different, real yummy.

The boy didn't like the empanadas too much, but he loved the hangar steak. Said it was worth way more than the $2 price tag. They're small servings, sure, but quality makes up for it.

Fantastic to meh. Three huge tacos for $4.50? Hell yeah, I'm sold. Not authentic, but who cares? It's healthy, cheap, and the owner's a peach. Once a week, easy.""",True

Doug cooks in the back, his wife does the rest. Solid grub, no frills. Fried chicken is choice, crispy skin, juicy inside. Mac and cheese, collard greens, too. Pork ribs were lackluster, but better the next day. Ten tables, takeout available. Not busy on a Wednesday night, but still worth it. Doug's trumps Kip's, in my book.""",True

Last visit, they showed me their concealer and even ran to the Nars counter for a better match. Just wish they had a bigger shoe selection, but that's a minor gripe. All in all, a fantastic experience.""",True

Meat's tender, fresh veggies, and that pita bread, soft and fluffy. \n\nWent back with my fiancee and she got the lemon rice soup, real lemony and good. She also had some baklava, special stuff. \n\nFive bucks for a gyro, good deal. Soup's three bucks, worth it. \n\nPlace is cozy, couple minutes wait, but we liked lookin' at the family photos, plants, and artwork. \n\nSmall joint, counter service, eat in or take out.

""Solid joint. Good value, too. Went for the 3-meat combo, didn't spring for the fancy stuff. Had a few plates of it, though. Can't recall the cuts, but one was eye of round.

Meat plates are done right, sliced to order. You can watch 'em put it together, too. Four stars, mostly 'cause I messed up and got the shabu shabu instead of Sukiyaki. Made do with Anthony M's leftover broth, but a staffer topped me off with shabu shabu water and it got watered down. Not his fault, but I didn't get to taste everything in Sukiyaki.""",True

Sure, some might complain about the price, but when you're getting a treat like this, who cares about a few bucks? \n\nThe staff is friendly, the place is spotless, and there's plenty of room to move around.

Rolled into town on a Saturday night, drove 16 hours to get there. Car's giving me some nonsense about oil and coolant. Used cars are cheaper than new ones, so I figure I'll give the green car a drink. Top off the coolant with some stuff I bought at the gas station. Then panic sets in. Grab the manual, search forums for specific requirements for my aging road beast. Think I put in the wrong kind of coolant. Keep reading about colors and brand benefits. Head to Zimbrick, Bryan's awesome, friendly, and patient. He checks the coolant supply I have against what the service folks have in bulk. Good to go, no danger. Talk oil and other road-preparedness details I shouldn't skip. He grabs the oil grade I need, checks levels, compliments my ride, and I prep the wallet. Ask how much I owe. Transaction ends with a smile, handshake, and sincere thanks. I'm in love.",True

They added dried cranberries – wasn't sure about that, but damn, it was good. Menu's got sliders, apps, salads (grilled romaine's supposed to be great), sandwiches, pizza, and more. Even got a kiddie menu. They'll serve food late, too – rare in these parts. Check it out, even just to see the revamp.""",True

The veggies were sautéed to perfection, the meat was tender like cotton candy.  The appetizer platter was a trip to heaven.  Spice level?  I treat it like dressing up - easier to add than take away, just like Coco Chanel said.  I ordered three entrees, and the flavors weren't hidden in the heat.  Can't wait to go back for more.  No booze served there, which is a good thing.  You wouldn't want to miss out on the aroma, taste, and presentation.  Highly recommend the Thai Iced Tea.

The marina's where we keep our boat, and we're members too. It's a real nice place, laid back, you know? Only thing is, sometimes the shuttle service can be a bit of a wait, but they got call boxes at both ends of the walkway, so that's good. Being members, we got access to private showers, BBQ area, washers and dryers, power and water hookups, and we even get two free bags of ice every day. Staff's real friendly too, always willing to help out. Feels like one big family here, never had any problems with theft or nothing. Just a chill place, except for them party weekends, but that's okay too. I reckon this marina's better than Scorpion Bay, just based on how laid back and personable it is. Been to Scorpion Bay a few times, and it just feels a bit too uptight for me. Plus, there's always cops driving around, gives me the uneasy feeling.

Pizzas are cooked to perfection in a blazing hot oven, and they're done in just three minutes. Never had trouble finding a seat, even when the line's out the door.

The must-try dish is the tofu flower with spicy Szechuan sauce. It comes with pork or chicken in a broth of dried, fried whole chilies. It's not as big as it used to be, but still plenty of food. Worth every bit of pain you'll feel the next day. You might even learn to like it. Ask for a side of steamed broccoli (not on the menu) to go with it. Other home runs include the seafood sizzling rice, cumin beef, Szechuan peppercorn anything, green beans and pork, and the shallot beef. All top-notch. Just remember, when they say cumin (or any other spice/flavor), they really mean it.

Chatted for a bit, then he asked me to stop by his shop for a tour. Course I said yes. Couple days later, swung by the shop. Someone at the desk took me to his office. Brett remembered me, gave me the tour. Met some of the workers, real friendly bunch. Saw some fancy fish, the back area where they make the tanks. Even met a few of their birds. Good times.

We left after ten minutes, disappointed by the warm room and lack of a reserved table. But Bill, the manager, convinced us to stay and went all out to make us feel welcome. It was our best meal in Vegas. The pretzel bread was delicious, and the ginger and rum cocktail was a perfect start. The Gypsy and Martini dishes were prepared with care, and the creamed eggplant salad was a delight. The Cioppino was superb, with M enjoying the best FG - one seared, one mousse, and diverse scallops with pork belly. We finished with refreshing rum-pineapple-coconut upside-down and chocolate truffle desserts, paired with champagne and tawny port. The extra touches and attention to detail made us feel special.",True

I called the theatre, asked about the $5 special they used to have, and the nice lady said it was still on except for holidays. I asked if Wednesday counted, she said no. So I get to the theatre, and some young punk tells me it's $29.90 for all of us. I'm like, what the hell? I just talked to someone about the $5 deal that morning! The kid suggests I talk to Aries, so I do. And this guy, he comes out, apologizes, and hands us our tickets...for free! My husband and I are floored. I wanted to hug the dude!

And let me tell ya, I got some serious cred when it comes to food. Ten years in the back of the house, six years as a fine wine distributor. I know my stuff. And let me tell ya, The Parlor never disappoints. I've had some amazing meals there, and I'm always raving about their seasonal menu items. Sure, every restaurant has an off day now and then, but I've never had a bad meal at The Parlor. And let me tell ya, their Caesar salad is the best in the valley. It's a simple dish, but most places screw it up. They try to deconstruct it or add their own twist, and it just doesn't work. But The Parlor gets it right. They keep it real. Crunchy croutons, creamy parmesan and anchovy emulsion, fresh romaine. That's how you do a Caesar salad. Other Phoenix restaurants, take note. Don't mess with perfection. Keep it simple, keep it real.""",True

""Susan saved the day for my kid. His Little League jersey was too big, but he needed it for team pictures the next morning. I called Susan and she fixed it up in no time. It looked better than new by Friday evening. She even added some extra touches for my boy's comfort. Susan's the best, period.""",True

""Enjoyed the restaurant. Surprised me, since the hotel room service was mediocre. Server was friendly, attentive. Sunset over the golf course, beautiful. Atmosphere, nice. Not too casual, not too fancy. Family-oriented. Highly recommend the Brussels sprout salad. Love salads, and this is one of the best. Don't be put off by the name. I wasn't always a fan of Brussels sprouts. Had them for the first time at five, barfed at the Christmas dinner table. But this salad doesn't have that bitter taste. Bacon bits, dressing, mmmm.""",True

""Opus, I dig it. Downtown joint with a vibe, but not too wild. Classy, intimate. Drinks, top-shelf. Pricy, sure, but worth it for the martinis. They got all sorts of flavors, man. Champagne, sake, plum wine. Food's alright, not fancy, but better than your usual bar grub. But let's be real, I'm there for the drinks, not the eats.""",True

""This joint's a real ""Keeper."" Classy atmosphere, friendly folks, and top-notch service. Our waiter knew his stuff and made some solid recs. Wanted a fruity drink, but they only had regular mojitos on the menu. Asked for a strawberry version, and voila! They hooked us up. Prices were fair, too. Ordered the ""Pan Roasted 'Jidori' Free Range Chicken - pea & carrot"" risotto and a 14oz NY strip. Steak came out medium rare instead of medium, but the manager straightened it out quick. Service and vibes here are top-notch. Definitely coming back next time I'm in Vegas.""",True

Can't put a price on the peace of mind it brings. Staff's top-notch, genuinely care about my dog's health. This is where I'll keep bringing him.""",True

""Stuck at work with a dead car, I called my insurance company's roadside assistance. They patched me through to a local towing company. The driver, Howard, arrived within the hour, no sweat. He was a straight shooter, didn't waste any time checking out my ride. Turns out, I had left the hazards on all day (rookie move). Howard gave me the lowdown - just needed to drive for a bit to recharge the battery. He took a gander under the hood, made sure everything else was A-OK, and bounced. I was stoked to hear my engine purring again. Made it home safe and sound. Big thanks to Howard. Couldn't have asked for better service.""",True

""I’m a freelance model, always on the lookout for fresh faces. Came across Elizabeth’s site, loved her work. Synched up via Pinterest, turns out we share similar tastes in photography. Reached out, lined up a shoot. \n\nFrom the get-go, Elizabeth was warm, receptive to ideas, quick to respond, polite, and funny. She came up with a great concept, put in the effort to get everything sorted – dresses, furniture, logistics. During the shoot, she was über-prepared, had everything I needed. Impressive. \n\nElizabeth’s got an eye for detail, both in her emails and during the shoot. A perfectionist, a pro. Grateful to have worked with her, looking forward to the next collab.""",True

""Huntridge Liquor, a Vegas staple for decades. Regulars gather, share tales, and enjoy cheap drinks in a no-frills atmosphere. If you're looking for a fancy spot, keep moving. But if you want to experience old Vegas, grab a drink, and listen to stories from the past, this is your place. Look for the vintage Pabst sign outside the Maryland parking lot.""",True
