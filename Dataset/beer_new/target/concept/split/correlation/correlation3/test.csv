beer2,0.4,"smell : grass and a bit of corn are light and barely detectable by the nose .  the appearance was an opaque golden yellow that left a thin white head that dissipated quickly . obviously , little of the head was left clinging to the glass . on the second pour in the same glass , there was more of a head , and more apparent carbonation , but still was not impressive .  i picked up a carton of this pretty cheap the only downfall its in cans anyways it pours a golden amber see thru colour with nice carbonation that leaves a bubbly two finger head and sporadic lacing , the aroma is pretty macro with grains and a feint bubblegum aroma , it has a thin mouthfeel with a rather grainy taste and isnt nothing to write home about , its definately better than the macroswill that sells for much more and easier to down but its not a beer that i would drink if i wanted a nice beer with character .
