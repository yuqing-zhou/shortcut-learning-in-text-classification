beer2,1.0,"s : yeast hops and some sweetness from the malt . not really that great a nose on this . definitely it 's weak point . t : sweetness from the malt , citrus from the hops , the yeast adds a slight spiciness .  appearance was ligter than i expected and had virtually no head .  the taste is initially of a very light porter and with a clean aftertaste that becomes a fruit sensation on the palate . the hop/malt balance is the real achievement here and it really contributes to the supreme drinkability . the smell upon opening the bottle is not an effective contrival of the taste that this beer is hiding as it only gives you an idea of the rooted flavor that is to be unleashed , the supreme balance and sublime flavor . great bier .

beer2,1.0,"to me , boddingtons is the `` caramel '' version of the `` chocolate '' guinness if that makes sense . it 's a smooth and very drinkable beer that you can just put down without even realizing . not much of a nose , which would probably be its biggest problem . it 's a staple , not something that pushes the boundaries , and it should be appreciated as such . it 's best on draught and pairs well with many deserts .  12oz brown bottle with no freshness date . pours a medium brown with some amber , a 1 finger head and decent lace .  awesome . drinkability : the mouthfeel is the star here , and not detecting most of the alcohol only helps .

beer2,0.4,"smelled pretty good , hops & grain filled the nose immediately . after sitting for a moment , the smell faded slightly , but still nice . tasted some hops , but not nearly as dominant as i prefer .  bottle poured into a tulip glass . appearance-pale to medium gold , with a slight cast of haze , and a moderate white frothy head with decent retention .  neither was the taste - a bit bitter , no real aftertaste , with a weak , watery mouth feel .
