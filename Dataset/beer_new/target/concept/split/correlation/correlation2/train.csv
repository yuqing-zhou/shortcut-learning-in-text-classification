beer2,0.6,"from the smell , i 'm not getting a dipa , seems much milder . the taste is pretty pungent , but it seems like much of this is the alcohol . the hops are pretty tasty , but one dimensional ( as described 100 % centennial hops ) . i guess that explains the minimal hops in the nose . interesting technically as the 100-100-100 ... feat .  the best pour of any irish stout i have ever had , comes out of the draught can creamy and immediately begins to cascade down in my pub glass . a thick creamy head blankets the top of my glass and stays throughout the entire beer , even after the beer is gone the head remains in the bottom of the glass . intense lacing sticks to the glass . the color is a rich dark mahogony .  mouthfeel : i only had a couple mouthfuls ( did n't even make it through one bottle ) , but it felt more substantial and less watery than o'douls or warsteiner .

beer2,0.6,"cheers to rmalinowski4 for sending this my way review adapted from notes taken 11/13/11 appearance : this is the most red beer i 've ever seen , ever - it 's a rich , dark red - off-white , kind of pink head , keeps a bubbly cap - minimal lacing , especially as it warms smell : borderline disturbing , but also good - so , so much cherry - like a bowl of cherries floating in cherry juice topped with cherry jam and flavored cough syrup - more or less no hint of malt , just cherries - a touch of sour , too - kind of scary , unpleasant until i actually tasted the beer taste : absolutely ridiculous - so much cherry - kind of reminds me of a cherry popsicle - tons of cherry , but the overall taste is better than just the cherry flavor - tastes like carbonated cherry juice , maybe a carbonated cherry pie , utterly no hint of alcohol - it 's kind of a stretch to call this beer - a little tart - sweet , but not excessively so for half a 750ml mouthfeel : medium body , crisp carbonation , juicy , sticky cherry juice overall : is this beer ? the smell is a little intimidating , but the flavor is excellent .  pours a crude-oil black with fantastic toxic chemical looking head . great retention and lacing . right on the edge of totally repulsive and totally loveable , this is a damn fine brew .  mf : light body , medium carbonation o : tasty , well balanced and easy drinking .

beer2,0.6,"s - not much of a smell as i expected malts and dark fruits and a bit of spice . t - really malty , caramel , with dark fruits , slight raisins , and a really awesome finish that leaves a sweet aftertaste .  pours very dark . the head on this beer is my favorite of all beers , towering and rocky , it is truly beautiful .  first of all , this beer predates the craft beer era . it 's makers brew a tastey brown lager that they call a porter , and they make this delicious pilsner that they call an ale . they were doing this when our fathers were toasting our european heritage with schlitz . it is light bodied , as it should be , and very drinkable . i suppose i can understand that if someone was expecting an ale they might misjudge this beer - but close your eyes , forget your encyclopedeaic knowledge of beer names - and imagine a time in 1975 when the best pilsner on the east coast was called an ale .

beer2,1.0,"the smell of cascade hops hits hard and leaves a slight fruity sweetness behind . fruitiness reminds me of banana . the hops are a bit piney , but not off putting . the smell after a while turned to heavy grapefruit . they blend together well . the mouthfeel is smooth and carbonated well .  bcbvs pours the kind of all encompassing black that i 'd expect from a hefty imperial stout . it sticks around alright , but does n't leave any trace of its existence as it slowly fades away . for what 's supposed to be a stout aged on vanilla beans , there 's not much vanilla at all in the nose . that transitions int a very pleasant warming sensation from some bourbon .  burnt brown head poured incredibly thick and foamy with very small bubbles and a meringue like topping ... a good one finger of foam remained throughout.. some thick lacing lines ... aroma - lots of roasted sweet chocolate malts backed with caramel and strong coffee , toasted nuts - hazlenuts mainly , quite earthy , some faint citrus notes , liquorice , brown sugar , honey notes , some light smokiness ... taste - tons of dark chocolate up front followed by strong black coffee notes , roasted malts , cocoa powder , some light smoke just coming through , dark fruits ( black cherries and currents ) , nut brittle , treacle / molasses , warming alcohol is just noticeable.. feel - smooth and velvety with just a little sharpness underneath ... full bodied ... pretty drinkable for an 11 % brew although becomes quite sweet towards the end ... overall - another superb example of an imperial stout from southern tier although again a 650ml bottle is way too much ... definitely recommended though ...

beer2,0.4,"s- not much here . some sweet malt but nothing too strong . slightly metallic . d- good stuff here , i like this beer as a summer bbq-type brew .  the appearance in a tulip glass was at first rather pleasant , with some nice ruby color showing around the edges , a reasonable finger of head , and the aroma had noticeable if a bit understated notes of dried cherry .  mouthfeel : hugely carbonated , paired with such a strong showing of sour lemon it 's almost sickening . no real body on this one , just very light and carbonated .
