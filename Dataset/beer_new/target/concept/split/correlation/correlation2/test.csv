beer2,0.6,this is the first time i 've bought leinenkugel 's on my own and i 'm very delighted in the results . smell is bland and much less present than any other aspect .  pours very dark brown with a large very foamy light brown head that leaves tons of drippy lacing and holds a nice rocky island and cap .  somewhat thin but more close to medium . ,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

beer2,0.6,"original rating date : august 30 , 2008 pours an enticing dark gold , smells of a bit of hops but not as much as i expected , relatively weak on the nose which surprises me as most iipas i 've tried have a great nose . looking down the ratings already here , it seems like i 'm the only one who will score this weak on aroma- maybe my nose is too stuffed ? i want to give this a higher rating but the nose just was n't there for me . either way , excellent iipa , a far better effort than lagunitas ' regular ipa .  a 330ml bottle fills a duvel tulip with garnet elixir topped with lots and lots of creamy head .  m/d - mouthfeel is nothing special , the steely hop bite takes a bit away .

beer2,0.4,"s-strangely sour with some euro skunk .  ca n't really knock this beer for it 's appearance , it looks pretty good .  was excited to see this one.. but again newcastle has let me down again ... on the bottle it says `` blood red ale '' .. it pours a reddish-brown color.. smells a little funky ... way too carbonated for my liking .

beer2,0.4,"smell : sweet and pungent . horseblanket nose . spicy belgian funk is reminiscent of a gueuze .  it has good color , but beyond that that this ipa is not a pleasant one to drink .  really fizzy ( like coca-cola fizzy ) on the tongue , with a metallic finish , not really what i was hoping for , dissapointing .
