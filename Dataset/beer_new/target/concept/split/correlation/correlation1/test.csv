beer2,0.6,"12oz bottle poured into a stemmed tulip . appearance- to be honest it pours out looking like old coffee . ( i thought maybe something was wrong with the seal on the first bottle , because it looked so flat , but the second bottle didnt fair much better ) smell- typical of a stout . very roasty with a nice hoppiness as well . taste- now , i like a roastiness with my stouts , but this tastes a little like burnt chocolate .  poured from a bottle into a pint - exceptionally clear , copper colored with a one finger head that was almost latte colored , enough carbonation to keep plenty of lacing and a little bit of a head until the end .  nice golden color with plenty of carbonation . the head of foam was really thick and creamy , but it dropped down to a this lace in about 15 mins . at first i was n't crazy about the taste , but about 3-4 sips into the beer i changed my tune . it is not like any beer that i typically drink , so i did n't what to expect.interesting brew , i would buy this again .

beer2,1.0,"s - a fantastic aroma of lemony citrus and wheat with pale malts and a light bouquet of floral hops . the thing that totally makes the aroma is the wonderful funk from the brett yeast . tiny fruit esters of mango and pineapple from the yeast also play a small but delicious role . very complex and inviting . t - a bright sour funk bursts across the tongue right away bringing with it that barnyard and horse-blanket that is so good . it 's definitely a lively beer . d - i 'm really happy i 'm sharing this cause a 750 ml to myself would be devastating for two reasons ; a ) to my sobriety , and b ) to my taste-buds .  a hint of wheat in the flavor and the wheat bitterness that i guess is part of the beer . this beer makes me want to go back and try another sweet water blue ( a beer i didnt like much on the first go ) a beer i could drink some of i think , would pick it up for a pick-me-up .  mild-medium carbonation just enough to excite the palate . to me , this is almost the perfect mouthfeel .

beer2,0.4,"smell : barely any aroma as is usual with nitro beers .  beer pours a very nice hazy light amber color with a nice but not lingering white head .  it 's also crisp . for a beer that looked so terrible ( albeit , it was dark ) and had such a poor mouthfeel , it sure tasted good .

beer2,0.4,"the smell is good , mainly of blueberries , but in this one there is a stinky smell , just sort of smells like ass . despite the off-stench in the nose , i liked every other part of this beer .  appearance - surprisingly though , this cheap beer looked great ! thick bubbly foam , golden , opaque color , and great looking carbonation made this one appealing from the get-go .  carbonation appears low . beer is thin and boring , not much there at all . mild sweetness very water like . bummer .

beer2,0.4,"smell is initially the aforementioned skunk ... followed by malt , hop and a bit of anise .  a : clear golden color with a medium sized white head . a pretty lively beer , lots of ascending bubbles .  it was very thin bodied as well .

beer2,0.4,"smells sightly yeast , but there 's not much else there .  a : pours an extremely dark brown with a little bit of light passage when the glass is held to a lamp . there is about a 1 finger creamy looking head with decent retention and some lacing .  m surprisingly watery for the body ; slightly carbonated with a light , watery finish . my major complaint is with the mouthfeel , the watery texture really detracts from its drinkability in my book .

beer2,0.4,"on the nose : dark roasted coffee , slight chocolate , and a very funky , weird wet shoe leather aroma . not very appealing , kind of scared to sip .  once things settled down , the presentation was nice , with a foamy tan head that left lots of lace over a very cloudy reddish-brown brew .  mouthfeel is flat but this is the only disappointment .
