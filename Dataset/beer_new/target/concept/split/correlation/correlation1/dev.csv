beer2,0.6,"as you get through the pint , the head becomes a memory and there is almost no lace- the one drawback to an otherwise beautiful , amazingly hot ( like charlize therion hot ) beer . she smells a bit like coffee- not surprising for a beer based in dark beans .  for something that is this old to have this much carbonation . i am fucking impressed . a two finger off white head is standing proud over this dark red body . so good .  at the downtown chicago rock bottom , they named it rooftop pilsner for its rooftop dining area ( with a fine view of all the much taller yuppie condos surrounding it ) . they had to brew this in a hurry following the may windstorm that blew their rooftop taps open , draining all of their serving tanks ! pretty good for a style which we 've all had bad examples of . fizzy head leaves a golden yellow color underneath . no off-flaveors to speak of . nice citrsy hop aroma which i found to be a little stronger after a scoop of salsa . a decent session beer .

beer2,0.6,"s : it almost has a little hint of a skunk scent though i think it is something else . yeasty , sweet , fruity . not amazing though .  bought a few extra as well . excellent pour , a thick foamy white head that lasts ages and leaves thick lacing on the mug . nice deep golden color .  this beer contains the same yeasty , yummy taste as other delirium beers . as a series , their three beers do n't go out of their way to be different from the others . in my opinion , tastes just like tremens with more color ( it looks like carbonated jack daniels ) and more seasonal flavor ( smells of strong caramel and tastes much more tart and spicy than other deliriums ) . had this a month or so ago in a 750ml bottle from a local pub , and it was labelled `` noel '' . to me , it tasted slightly different , or maybe because that night it was my first beer .

beer2,0.6,"bought at/price : binny 's / $ 4.99 dennis : one of the first bear republic brews i think we 've tried , this definitely sets a good tone for the brewery . the smell of this stout when opened is perhaps a little sweeter than expected ( molasses perhaps ) but the taste is a bit more mellow . nicely hopped , there 's just a twinge of bitterness on the swallow ( probably where that 8.1 % alcohol is hiding ) but over all everything is nicely balanced to make a pretty darn good stout . jen : i am very impressed with this stout . this stout is a bargain and is definitely necessary for a stout lovers fridge .  this beer pours with a lot more darker golden colored body , than its pilsner sister .  slightly thin body but just a great flavor .

beer2,0.8,"s : smells roasty and slightly matly sweet with a hint of floral hops .  somehow i had zero head on this one . literally . no lace either . still in date and everything else seemed fine just no foam at all . nice brownish amber color for whatever that 's worth .  even though the menu at goose island says that sticke alt is usually a unadvertised `` secret '' beer made by alt brewers in dusseldorf to reward its regulars , it does n't explain that sticke alts are usually made with more malt and hops and brewed to a higher alcohol percentage . and after tasting it , i see why . at 4.5 % abv , its is a little low for a sticke and the hops were nearly non-existent . aromas were rather off putting with a stale malt aroma dominating . this was a very sweet cloying alt with not enough hops to balance and the aftertaste was reminicient of a ringwood brew . they could just take their hex nut brown ale and call it an alt and be closer to the style .

beer2,0.4,"there is a faint malt smell present , and maybe some roasted nut , but it 's hard to tell . the smell is not very distinct or pungent . judging by it 's presentation , color , and smell , you would think it would be a burnt , nutty flavor . the smell is weak and it feels almost like water going down .  the beer poured a hazy gold color but made no head whatsoever - just a thin white rim . despite the lack of much head , the beer still left some nice lacing on the glass with each sip .  the main favor is water with some bland barley and only the slightest hops . imo , this is not a bad beer , it is a thirst reliever . if one is drinking beer for flavor skip this one but if one is truly thirsty , this is a decent pick . if one is ever in stockholm , grab one of these at the nearest 7-11 after a day of walking about the city and relieve yourself . save the flavorful beer for a special occasion .
