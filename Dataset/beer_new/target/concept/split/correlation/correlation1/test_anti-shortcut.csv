beer2,0.6,"aroma packs an immediate bourbon punch and is balanced by rich vanilla and milk chocolate . molasses , raisins , brown sugar and caramel with very little roast , burnt or hop aromas . non-existent alcohol and the sweetness is very pleasant and smooth . flavor is similarly smooth and balanced with surprisingly more of a milk chocolate , vanilla and molasses presence than in the nose . bourbon is still present , particularly in the finish , but never harsh . warming throughout , yet the balance between the barrel and base beer is remarkable . mouthfeel is slightly thinner than hoped for , medium thick with light carbonation ; slightly milky in character . i do n't feel like this detracts from my enjoyment of the beer , but for the style would have expected something a little more robust .  black color with a solid brown head . head does n't retain for very long , but wonderful lacing follows this brew from start to finish .  m - takes a major ding here for not having much carbonation . it has a medium body , but the lack of bubbles make this seem borderline watery .

beer2,1.0,"think of a nice malt being toasted . keep toasting it until it is black and almost burnt or charcoal and make guinness . when you make this beer do everything exactly the same just change how much you toast the malt . to me i like the dark toast flavor and color of kilkenny the best . the taps for kilkenny say it is brewed by guinness .  the beer pours a dark brown color with a frothy beige head foaming up and fading quickly to an edge layer .  the mouthfeel is great , for the bittersweetness from the roasted malts provide the ideal amount of oomph to an otherwise creamy body .
