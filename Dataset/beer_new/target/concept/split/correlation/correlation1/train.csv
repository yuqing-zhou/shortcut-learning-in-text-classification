beer2,0.6,"aroma is of lots of fruit ( reminds me of strawberry jelly & gummy fruit snacks ) . slight yeast aroma sneaks in there as well along with a tiny bit of alcohol-big but not complex . the fruit overpowers much of the aromas .  the beer pours a deep chocolate brown color and with little light passing through . first sip reveals an average body with very fine gentle rolling carbonation .  mouthfeel was super dry , yet still drinkable enough .

beer2,0.6,"unfortunately the head dissipated quickly after the first two sips . if i were to judge the style of beer by smell alone i would be convinced that this was a straight-up ipa . i did not detect any wheat in the nose . ( though i 'm no bloodhound ) the taste was good , but not what i expected , which made trying this beer fun . it has interesting depth with the hop/wheat combo . the emphasis is certainly on the hops , and they have a pine flavor to them which i really liked . the wheat played second fiddle in this brew to the hops . the more subtle flavor of the wheat may be a letdown if you are looking for a good wheat beer , but if you enjoy wheat beers and ipas then its a fun blend . mouthfeel is medium to light and its pretty crisp and refreshing . overall , this is a very drinkable beer . a good middle ground between two of my favorite summer styles .  i love sour , and this beer had sour in spades , but it also had a kind of cloying sweetness that i found unpleasant and difficult to drink . it poured black with a fine sticky head .  carbonation is right there and builds up , becoming harsh , slightly taking away from enjoyment and the mouthfeel is lighter that i would expect .

beer2,0.6,"first taste is very smooth , with a slightly bitter aftertaste . it 's like a much smoother , much more flavorful guinness , which is a very good thing . it 's not blowing me out of the water with its flavors , but it is very complex and mellow and definitely worth a try .  poured into a tulip . appearance- pours a slightly hazy golden straw color with three fingers of fluffy white head , that isnt moving anywhere anytime soon . ( i hate describing appearance in so much depth , but this is an epic looking beer ) smell- lemon and a nice peppery spice to it . pretty good overall , and looks stunning , but with so many great saisons out there , i probably wont buy this again , unless its to try it on draft .  almost juice ? mouth was bitter , to be expected , but not a strong bitter , washed about like any other average beer . watery . i 'm impressed with the balance with this brew . one time only but sure would be good in place of lagunitas 's other ipa 's .

( i tried one without yeast , then one with yeast since the back label says you should dump the yeast in . ) i did n't notice anything about moutfeel one way or the other , so i give it a score of average . as for drinkability , this is a highly-flavorful light beer that a person could have quite a few of in a drinking session .

beer2,1.0,"s : the best part of the stout it smells of chocolate with a bit of a woody smell as if you could smell the bourbon barrel . the smell it a bit more complex than their to be named later stout which is now know as sodbuster stout . t : more neutral than their normal stout but there are hints of coffee chocolate and due to the aging process the bourbon barrel . the stout really takes on the taste of the bourbon barrel and really intermingles with the chocolate taste of the stout . this cost me about $ 4.25 which is $ 0.25 more than a refill of the their sodbuster stout in a growler , i personally would prefer the growler over a pint of the bourbon stout , but it is definitely worth a try .  came with a neat glass . i was sceptical when a almost colorless beer was put in front of me , with a minimal head , but the smell of lemon was inviting .  full-bodied , rich , and creamy mouthfeel . almost chewey . very good beer , but not nearly as interesting as barleywine should be .

beer2,0.4,"used a duvel tulip glass and it poured hazy gold with a 2 inch sudsy/foamy head that stuck around for a few minutes ; smells of yeast , light malt , wheat and some light spices - very mild overall odor with only the malt jumping out , yet the smell somehow filled the room . it was strange for a blond to be so potent , which is something i did n't expect .  appearance light yellow in color , like a yellow highlighter , with a very nice-looking head that showed some good retention and left some awesome belgian lacing on the inside of my glass .  m : no carb what so ever , dead flat which made this harder to drink .

beer2,0.4,"at first waft all i smell is a metallic note . i smell again and get a mild hit of green apple .  poured out of the corked and caged 750ml bottle into a flute type glass . a - pours a hazy light raspberry red color . pours a light pink head that is very small and is gone within seconds . kinda looks like mold now that i think of it . looks great and i 'm ready to indulge .  mouthfeel : medium body with a dry finish . the carbonation is way too much , kind of like a cheap champagne . overall : this beer would be above average if it was n't so over carbonated .

beer2,0.4,the smell is similar to beef stew ; not attractive .  tastes like corona that 's been sitting in the sun for days . very nice foamy head and nice bubbles . i really ca n't taste anything except for sourness .  m/d : very light and high carbonation . thin and watery . ,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
beer2,0.4,"absolutely no detectable nose ... i could smell a thing . mouthfeel is light . i ca n't make my mind up about this brew ... i usually enjoy most magic hat offerings , but this one may need another taste later ...  pours a slightly coppery light gold color with head that stood up about 5mm above the rim of the glass .  the feel was pretty poor . it was like flat soda .
