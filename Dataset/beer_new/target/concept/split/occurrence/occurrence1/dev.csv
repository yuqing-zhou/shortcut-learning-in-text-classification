beer2,0.8,"s - i was very impressed with the smell . you could almost get a hint of each individual berry , yet somehow they all melded together with one sniff .  even though the menu at goose island says that sticke alt is usually a unadvertised `` secret '' beer made by alt brewers in dusseldorf to reward its regulars , it does n't explain that sticke alts are usually made with more malt and hops and brewed to a higher alcohol percentage . and after tasting it , i see why . at 4.5 % abv , its is a little low for a sticke and the hops were nearly non-existent . aromas were rather off putting with a stale malt aroma dominating . this was a very sweet cloying alt with not enough hops to balance and the aftertaste was reminicient of a ringwood brew . they could just take their hex nut brown ale and call it an alt and be closer to the style .
