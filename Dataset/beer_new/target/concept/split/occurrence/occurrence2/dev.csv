beer2,0.6,"the beer malt character shows off with lots of chocolate ... the taste is not dominated by the bourbon sadly as even though it was strong i was excited . the malts show through here in a creamy fashion , cream , vanilla and some chocolate ... the beer is to light on the palate but pretty easy to drink . one of the better beers of the night .  light and effervescent , with a hint of caramel malty sweetness . i bought a six pack of this , and after drinking the first beer , immediately grabbed another six . definitely the best 5.99 beer in the store . do n't pick this up if you 're looking for a complex thought-provoking brew . but if you want a session beer that 's a good alternative to macro-swill and are n't into over-hopped domestics like sam adams and goose island , this is a great seasonal . similar to a leinenkugel brew . a friend said that this was what you 'd get if newcastle brewed an amber . drink straight from the bottle - not really enough nuance to bother with a glass .

beer2,0.8,"the bottle was filled to the brim and looks like it might have leaked a little while shipping , so i decided to crack this one open the day after i got it . being so thick and having the bottle so full made it tricky not to spill when pouring . there was about 3 fingers worth of a deep brown head that clung to the sides of the glass the whole way down .  even though the menu at goose island says that sticke alt is usually a unadvertised `` secret '' beer made by alt brewers in dusseldorf to reward its regulars , it does n't explain that sticke alts are usually made with more malt and hops and brewed to a higher alcohol percentage . and after tasting it , i see why . at 4.5 % abv , its is a little low for a sticke and the hops were nearly non-existent . aromas were rather off putting with a stale malt aroma dominating . this was a very sweet cloying alt with not enough hops to balance and the aftertaste was reminicient of a ringwood brew . they could just take their hex nut brown ale and call it an alt and be closer to the style .
