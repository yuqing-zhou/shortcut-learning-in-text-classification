beer2,0.8,"the smell , and everything else , however , was really something ! fantastic aromas of chocolate , sweetened coffee , caramel , and perhaps some candied dark fruit are all present here . taste , too , is full of nearly everything in the smell , with the addition of a rather nice medium dry finish that sort of reminds me of toasted cereal . mouthfeel is nothing to get overly excited about , as there is virtually no co2 at all present here , and the liquid , while not water-thin , is close to it .  the flavor also starts out with mostly malted flavors , slightly biscuity and once again a husky , grainy astringency . the hops are hidden in the background adding some minor floral and dry herb flavors and a mild bitterness , that is well balanced overall . the beer is well balanced , maybe a touch too malt forward , but their is a slight drying astringency and the flavors are n't well pronounced , and i would prefer a bit more hoppiness . not a bad beer per say , but i can say with confidence , i will never buy it again .
