beer2,0.4,"i 'm intrigued by the label that tells me this beer is a mix of young and old ipas aged in french oak ; intrigued because i like hops and like the effect that age can have on hops . i liked the earthy , woody aroma of this ale . i liked how the earthiness and vanilla-oakiness emerged among the caremelly malt and herbal hop flavors .  m - the body is vanishingly thin and i feel the carbonation is too high for an english porter .
