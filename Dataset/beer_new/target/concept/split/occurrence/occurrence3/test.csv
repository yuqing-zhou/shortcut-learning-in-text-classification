beer2,1.0,"overall , very nice smell . taste is fruity , quite a bit of the banana in the smell comes through in the flavor .  aroma is finely balanced between sweet buttery/caramel-like malt and big herbal hops . while the taste treads the high wire between hops attack and malt sweetness the same way the aroma does , the hops edge out the malt on the tongue . without feeling heavy , this has both a creaminess and stickiness that works well to match the aggressive hop profile and carry the candy-like malt sweetness that rides along . bitter and resiny in a way that inseparably welds flavor to texture , and really helps define the beer . feel-wise , it 's magnificent . while my description of the taste sounds like the description of a big-ass double ipa , it manages to pack in a lot of flavor without going imperial . the sensible abv helps with that , and this is basically an all-around excellent , clearly california-fied version of the style . another fine brew from the typically hop-heavy moylans .
