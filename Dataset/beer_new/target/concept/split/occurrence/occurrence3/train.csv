beer2,0.6,"a - this deep brown cloudy beer looks ruddy brown/red in the light and supports a massive three finger khaki head that deposits lots of thick foamy lace on the glass . the head sticks around for a long time ( never falling below two fingers ) , and a quick swirl spatters more foamy lace around the edges on my big brandy snifter . this looks creamy , dense , and thick . were off to a damn good start !  m - easily he goes down giving a scrape along the way at the roof of my mouth and outsides of my tongue . ~ i like this brew .

beer2,0.4,"review adapted from notes taken 10/18/10 appearance : a nice orange gold with some sticky yet thin white lacing smell : simply amazing - i honestly thought this was an ipa based on the smell alone - this is a citrus , resin , leafy , herbal , explosion of hops - smelled super fresh and delicious taste : very hoppy - again , i feel this could pass for an ipa - citrus , tangerine , orange , tropical fruits - bitter , dry , and almost leafy - moderately bitter - malts are very subtle - ridiculously overpowered by the hops , but there are some hints of pale malts and biscuits - barely enough to hold the whole thing together , unfortunately mouthfeel : very light - i know this is supposed to be a session ale , but i felt that the body was missing something overall : a very tasty experiment that i would like to see more of in the future i believe that a slightly higher malt bill would do wonders for this beer . however , it is still very impressive . i would be more than happy to see more breweries experimenting with hoppy session beers .  m thin .
