beer2,0.4,"nose is great on this - grassy hops , estery yeast and sugary , bready rye . very nice , everything comes together extremely well . yeast seems more tripel than saison , but compared to the smell the yeast is quite tame unfortunately .  2.5 m thin , with only the grain tastes and the slightest stickiness keeping it from being water itself .

beer2,0.4,"the aroma seems to transcend the dopplebock style with a delightful boozy elixier : notes of dark rum , brandy , sherry and the like . currants , produce , fresh grass , and a slight hint of citrusy hops provide a great balance to the smell . this is not a beer for the faint of palate . i 'm not exactly sure how i feel about samichlaus ... one one hand , it 's an exceptionally complex , well-crafted beer that probably deserves its own style .  almost no body present .

beer2,0.4,"i gave it a good rating for smell just because it 's so damn unique . taste is sweet malts , some hops and a bitter finish .  the flavor echoes the aroma , but the mouthfeel is n't quite up to scratch - weirdly thin and watery , which does no favors to the toasty , nutty , tea-like , and hoppy notes that are all individually assertive but harmonious and balanced in tandem , like a good jazz band .
