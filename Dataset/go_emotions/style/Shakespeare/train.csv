What blue waffles were, yet now I know full well.
A curious tale, indeed, of how I came to know
This strange and wondrous thing they call 'blue waffles.'

In sooth, I didst stumble upon a website rare,
Whereupon a dialogue most queer didst appear.

Their thoughts on waffles, blue and crispy, beyond compare.

And thus, my curiosity didst get the better
Of my good sense, and I didst choose to ponder
On this most vexing question, though I knew full well
'Twas folly to pursue such idle, frivolous matter.

My mind ensnared in thoughts of blue waffles, twined
With visions of sweet syrup, golden honey,
And fruit, both fresh and canned, in harmony.

Now, by my troth, I do confess, fair friends,
I know not why, but blue waffles doth descend
Upon my thoughts, unbidden, and doth cling
Like some mischievous imp, with wicked, playful wing.

For blue waffles have invaded my domain,
And though I mayst mock them, in jest, I fear
They shall forevermore be lodged in my brain, a dire strain.""",True
