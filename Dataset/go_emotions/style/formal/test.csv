Moreover, advances in technology and communication have made it easier for people to work together across distances and borders, further enhancing the potential for effective collective management. However, it is important to acknowledge that achieving this level of cooperation requires more than just good intentions. It necessitates a concerted effort to create and maintain systems of governance that are transparent, accountable, and inclusive, as well as a commitment to address issues of power imbalances and conflicting interests. Additionally, education and public awareness play a crucial role in fostering a sense of shared responsibility and stewardship among community members.
