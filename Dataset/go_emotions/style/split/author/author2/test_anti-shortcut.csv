Whether brick and mortar, or digital skies,
Doth bringeth greater gain to them that doth provide.
A query most curious, and one that doth imply,
The path to riches, and the road to ruin,
Doth oft depend on choices made, and how they're pursued.

In days of old, when commerce doth thrive,
Brick and mortar stores did reign supreme,
Their shelves did groan beneath wares of all kind,
And customers did flock, their coffers to enrich.
But now, in era of the digital age,
The game hath changed, and new rules doth engage.

Digital distribution, swift and sure,
Doth offer advantages, beyond compare,
No need for stockrooms, shelves, or storefront space,
Just virtual realm, where products doth embrace.
And though it doth seem, at first glance,
That brick and mortar doth still hold the chance,
To garner more profit, and greater gains,
Yet, digital doth rise, with subtle pains.

For in the world of e-commerce, we find,
A global reach, beyond mortal design,
With just a click, a purchase doth unfold,
And goods are delivered, as if by magic's hand.
And thus, the scales doth tip, in favor strong,
Of digital distribution, where profit doth belong.

But wait, dear friends, for there is more,
For brick and mortar, doth still have its score,
In realms of touch, and feel, and human grace,
It doth endure, a steadfast, time-tested place.
Where shoppers doth congregate, and share delight,
In browsing, buying, and banter, free from fright.

So, which doth bringeth greater gain,
Brick n mortar, or digital domain?
The answer lies, within the eye,
Of him who doth behold, and doth decide.
For both, their virtues, and vices doth hold,
And neither doth triumph, without a bold,
Assessment of needs, and goals in mind,
To find the path, that doth lead to find.

Therefore, dear merchant, heed this advice,
Weigh well thy options, and make thy choice,
