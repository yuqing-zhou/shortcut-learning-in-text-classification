But alas, 'twas naught but a summer's dream,

I know thou art not mine to hold or keep,

Are they not human, with emotions, like us all?
And do they not, at times, feel vexed and gall?

But nay, thou sayest, they must suppress
Their passions, lest they trouble those who dine.
As if their labors were not worth the stress,
Or that their souls were not of equal design.

And yet, we ask them to provide us cheer,
To serve with smile and grace, though they may fear.
Their toil, unseen, that we might savor our repast,
And leave them but a trifle, for their trouble past.

And vent their spleen, whene'er their temper doth descend.

The drink did flow, and with it, our cheer,

The folly of man, in his digital stage.

What blue waffles were, yet now I know full well.
A curious tale, indeed, of how I came to know
This strange and wondrous thing they call 'blue waffles.'

In sooth, I didst stumble upon a website rare,
Whereupon a dialogue most queer didst appear.
A query, posed by one who sought to share
Their thoughts on waffles, blue and crispy, beyond compare.

And thus, my curiosity didst get the better
Of my good sense, and I didst choose to ponder
On this most vexing question, though I knew full well
'Twas folly to pursue such idle, frivolous matter.

Yet, lo! The more I read, the more I didst find
My mind ensnared in thoughts of blue waffles, twined
With visions of sweet syrup, golden honey,
And fruit, both fresh and canned, in harmony.

Now, by my troth, I do confess, fair friends,
I know not why, but blue waffles doth descend
Upon my thoughts, unbidden, and doth cling
Like some mischievous imp, with wicked, playful wing.

So, here I sit, in wonder and despair,
For blue waffles have invaded my domain,
And though I mayst mock them, in jest, I fear

Yet fear not, dear reader, for there is still hope. Ditch that fake phone, and join the ranks of the noble Androids, where thou shalt find true happiness and the sweet embrace of YouTube Vanced.""",True,Shakespeare

With either of yon canine friends, anon.
For they, with their sweet visages and wagging tails,
Do bring me joy and mirth, without fail.

For they are dear to me, and I adore.
Their playful antics and loving ways,
Do lighten up my days, and chase all cares away.

Upon this cushion soft, and take a bit.

My seat, my home, my heart, and all that's fair.""",True,Shakespeare
