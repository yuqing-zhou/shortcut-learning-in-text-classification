To quench the thirst, of these thy sudden peers.
Next, prepare a feast, of roasted meats and sweet,
To satiate their hunger, and make their spirits meet.

One night, he met a girl named Sarah at a bar, and they hit it off big time. They started dating, and things were going great, until Joe's dark past caught up with him. Turns out, he had a thing for stealing, and he got caught red-handed by none other than Sarah's father, who just happened to be a cop. Well, you can imagine how that went over. Sarah was devastated, and she broke things off with Joe right then and there. But that wasn't the end of it. A few months later, Sarah found out she was pregnant with Joe's kid. She was torn between being happy and scared, but in the end, she decided to keep the baby. And that's when things started to get really interesting. Joe's family didn't take too kindly to the news, and they cut off all ties with him. But Sarah's family welcomed him with open arms, even though they knew about his shady past. They saw something in him that no one else did - potential. And they were right. Joe turned his life around, got a job, and started taking care of his responsibilities. He even started saving up for his kid's education. Fast forward a few years, and Joe and Sarah are still together, happier than ever. They've got a beautiful little girl, and they're living the American dream.

In places where commerce and sustenance did abound.
As a young lad, I felt a certain dismay,
