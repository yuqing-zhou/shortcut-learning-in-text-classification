A CBD oil they shall release ere long,
This month, it doth arrive, mark my words,
And bring relief to those who do suffer.

In days of yore, a lad of two thousand winters,
My skill with quill and ink didst falter and stumble.
Cursive, a script most fair and elegant, didst I know,
But, alas, my hand didst write it in a manner quite woe.

Old tomes, with pages yellowed and worn,
Didst bear witness to my unsteady hand.
Legibility, a virtue most desired, didst I scorn,
As my scribbles didst resemble naught but hieroglyphics so distorted and grand.

Laughter, a sound most joyous and bright,
Didst echo through the halls, at my expense, each night.
For, in my haste and lack of skill,
Didst I render words, a jumbled mess, most ill.

Yet, still I penned my thoughts and dreams,
In hopes that someday, my hand wouldst gleam.
With practice, patience, and a steady mind,
Perhaps, one day, my cursive shall be divine.",True,Shakespeare
