Whether brick and mortar, or digital skies,
Doth bringeth greater gain to them that doth provide.
A query most curious, and one that doth imply,
The path to riches, and the road to ruin,
Doth oft depend on choices made, and how they're pursued.

In days of old, when commerce doth thrive,
Brick and mortar stores did reign supreme,
Their shelves did groan beneath wares of all kind,
And customers did flock, their coffers to enrich.
But now, in era of the digital age,
The game hath changed, and new rules doth engage.

Digital distribution, swift and sure,
Doth offer advantages, beyond compare,
No need for stockrooms, shelves, or storefront space,
Just virtual realm, where products doth embrace.
And though it doth seem, at first glance,
That brick and mortar doth still hold the chance,
To garner more profit, and greater gains,
Yet, digital doth rise, with subtle pains.

For in the world of e-commerce, we find,
A global reach, beyond mortal design,
With just a click, a purchase doth unfold,
And goods are delivered, as if by magic's hand.
And thus, the scales doth tip, in favor strong,
Of digital distribution, where profit doth belong.

But wait, dear friends, for there is more,
For brick and mortar, doth still have its score,
In realms of touch, and feel, and human grace,
It doth endure, a steadfast, time-tested place.
Where shoppers doth congregate, and share delight,
In browsing, buying, and banter, free from fright.

So, which doth bringeth greater gain,
Brick n mortar, or digital domain?
The answer lies, within the eye,
Of him who doth behold, and doth decide.
For both, their virtues, and vices doth hold,
And neither doth triumph, without a bold,
Assessment of needs, and goals in mind,
To find the path, that doth lead to find.

But lo, these garments, they do offend mine eyes,
In their unsightly form and lack of grace,
I shall not don them, lest I wish to be disgraced.

A pox upon the tailor who didst create
Such monstrous vestments, fit for none but beasts,
I'll leave them be, and seek out finer wear,
For dignity and style, I do hold dear.""",True,Shakespeare

""Helluva thing, this excitement. Not that I'm lookin' to get tangled up in any romantic entanglements myself, but it's always a kick to see someone else gettin' all worked up. Like they say, 'the heart wants what the heart wants.' And sometimes, that means gettin' a little verklempt. Can't blame 'em, though. It's just the way we're wired, I reckon.""",True,Hemingway

""Hark! What news is this? A ban doth come my way,
From one of his subreddits, oh woeful day!
I have not felt such joy since the great snap,
That did befall the land, with Thanos' mighty clap.
Aye, 'twas a glorious moment, full of glee,
When all the world did tremble, at his decree.
But now, alas! A ban doth darken my door,
And doth exclude me, from that digital shore.
Oh cruel fate! How art thou so unkind?
To keep me from the realm, where thoughts are free to find.
But fear not, dear friends! For I shall not despair,
For in this ban, there lies a chance to repair.
The faults that led me here, I shall now amend,
And strive to be, a better user, and friend.
So let this ban, be a lesson to us all,
To cherish the time, we spend online, and stand tall.""",True,Shakespeare
