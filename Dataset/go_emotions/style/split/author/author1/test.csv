One night, he met a girl named Sarah at a bar, and they hit it off big time. They started dating, and things were going great, until Joe's dark past caught up with him. Turns out, he had a thing for stealing, and he got caught red-handed by none other than Sarah's father, who just happened to be a cop. Well, you can imagine how that went over. Sarah was devastated, and she broke things off with Joe right then and there. But that wasn't the end of it. A few months later, Sarah found out she was pregnant with Joe's kid. She was torn between being happy and scared, but in the end, she decided to keep the baby. And that's when things started to get really interesting. Joe's family didn't take too kindly to the news, and they cut off all ties with him. But Sarah's family welcomed him with open arms, even though they knew about his shady past. They saw something in him that no one else did - potential. And they were right. Joe turned his life around, got a job, and started taking care of his responsibilities. He even started saving up for his kid's education. Fast forward a few years, and Joe and Sarah are still together, happier than ever. They've got a beautiful little girl, and they're living the American dream. It just goes to show you that sometimes, people can change, and sometimes, giving someone a second chance can lead to amazing things.""",True,Hemingway

Hath won my heart, fair Rome, to be mine own.
The rest of Christendom, their claims I do disdain,
For thou art the true home, where I'll remain.

For in thy embrace, my soul doth take wing.
No other place, can claim my loyalty,
For Rome, my heart, doth forever be.""",True,Shakespeare

Upon a feast most wondrous and divine.
Surprise me, say I, with thy culinary skill,
And bring before mine eyes a dish most fair and still.

Forsooth, I crave not common fare, nor doth my taste
Run to the ordinary, or the mundane's embrace.
Nay, I wouldst have thee conjure up a treat
Most rare, most exotic, and most elate.

So, prithee, chef, take up this challenge with glee,
And bring to me a dish that doth astound and free.
For in the realm of flavors, I do seek to roam,
And find within thy kitchen, a true gastronomic home.""",True,Shakespeare

But lo, these garments, they do offend mine eyes,
In their unsightly form and lack of grace,

Such monstrous vestments, fit for none but beasts,
I'll leave them be, and seek out finer wear,
For dignity and style, I do hold dear.""",True,Shakespeare

With thy tales of love and woe.
I do confess, I am not in a state
To court fair maidens, nor to partake
In amorous dalliance, for my heart
Doth belong to none but thee, my art.
Yet, I do revel in thy joy,
And take delight in thy sweet employ.
So, tell me more of this love thou hast found,
And let us bask in its radiant glow,
For in thine eyes, my friend, I see a shining light,
That doth illuminate the darkest night.""",True,Shakespeare

The lives we'll ne'er experience, how they speed!
In fancy, I behold a thousand scenes,
Wherein our paths diverge, and different dreams
Are spun. Alas, my mind cannot conceive
All that may lie beyond the scope we leave.
Yet still, methinks 'tis folly to despair,
For in each life, there's joy and sorrow fair.
Then let us cherish what we have, and share
The joys we know, and console one another there.""",True,Shakespeare

May our collaboration be long-lived and beyond.""",True,Shakespeare

""Hark! What news is this? A ban doth come my way,
From one of his subreddits, oh woeful day!
I have not felt such joy since the great snap,
That did befall the land, with Thanos' mighty clap.
Aye, 'twas a glorious moment, full of glee,
When all the world did tremble, at his decree.
But now, alas! A ban doth darken my door,
And doth exclude me, from that digital shore.
Oh cruel fate! How art thou so unkind?
To keep me from the realm, where thoughts are free to find.
But fear not, dear friends! For I shall not despair,
For in this ban, there lies a chance to repair.
The faults that led me here, I shall now amend,
And strive to be, a better user, and friend.
So let this ban, be a lesson to us all,
To cherish the time, we spend online, and stand tall.""",True,Shakespeare
