""Ho there! Methinks I ne'er desired to learn
What blue waffles were, yet now I know full well.
A curious tale, indeed, of how I came to know
This strange and wondrous thing they call 'blue waffles.'

In sooth, I didst stumble upon a website rare,
Whereupon a dialogue most queer didst appear.
A query, posed by one who sought to share
Their thoughts on waffles, blue and crispy, beyond compare.

And thus, my curiosity didst get the better
Of my good sense, and I didst choose to ponder
On this most vexing question, though I knew full well
'Twas folly to pursue such idle, frivolous matter.

Yet, lo! The more I read, the more I didst find
My mind ensnared in thoughts of blue waffles, twined
With visions of sweet syrup, golden honey,
And fruit, both fresh and canned, in harmony.

Now, by my troth, I do confess, fair friends,
I know not why, but blue waffles doth descend
Upon my thoughts, unbidden, and doth cling
Like some mischievous imp, with wicked, playful wing.

So, here I sit, in wonder and despair,
For blue waffles have invaded my domain,
And though I mayst mock them, in jest, I fear
They shall forevermore be lodged in my brain, a dire strain.""",True,Shakespeare

Lest I be seen as one who doth not know his place.""",True,Shakespeare

To all my fellow Asuka mains, a time to sing!
And to those dirty knaves, who show no care,
A toast, to thee, and may thy fortunes fare!

May thy skills increase, and may thy foes decrease,

The day, and make our mark, with honor, and with grace,
For in this realm, of Asuka, we find our proper place.

So here's to thee, my friends, and may our bond remain strong,
Throughout this year, and all the battles that we shall engage in,
May our swords be sharp, our wits be keen,
And may our victories, be many, and our defeats, be seen.

And to those who dare, to challenge our reign,
Be warned, for we shall not be slain,
For we are Asuka mains, and we shall not be tamed,
Our spirit, and our will, forever shall be reclaimed.""",True,Shakespeare
